Key findings include:\n\u00b7\nThe suppression of immune cell recruitment was most pronounced in neutrophils (72.4%-81.5%, p = 0.0091), classical monocytes (68.4%-73.6%, p = 0.0036), CD3+ T cells (56.4%-65.9%, p = 0.0047), and myeloid dendritic cells (59%-64.4%, p = 0.0174).\n\u00b7\nThe suppression of cytokine responses was most pronounced for TNF (35.3%-65.1%, p = 0.0099).\n\u00b7\nOverall, POLB 001 did not substantially modulate the intradermal LPS-driven increase in local erythema and perfusion.\n\u00b7\nPOLB 001 significantly reduced the IV LPS-driven increase in IL-6, IL-8, and TNF (37.7%-80.7%, all p < 0.0003), p38 MAPK phosphorylation levels in target cells (16.7%-60.9%, all p < 0.0001), and heart rate increase (4-9.3 bpm, p < 0.0001).\nAs\npreviously announced\n, the trial demonstrated that POLB 001 was safe and well-tolerated, with a clear dose-response relationship, inhibition of p38 MAPK activation, and reduction in all measured pro-inflammatory cytokines. The results agree with previous observations that POLB 001 has the potential to prevent an excessive immune response without ablating normal immune function.\nThe findings provide strong validation of POLB 001's method of action and supports its progression towards further clinical development. The publication further strengthens the rationale for POLB 001 as a potential solution for the prevention of cancer immunotherapy-induced Cytokine Release Syndrome (\"CRS\").\nPOLB 001 to prevent CRS\nThe Directors believe that POLB 001 has the potential to transform the cancer immunotherapy field by expanding administration from centralised specialist cancer centres into community hospitals by making the treatments safer through the prevention of CRS, a potentially life-threatening side effect. As such, POLB 001 could make these treatments more accessible to a broader patient population, increase the number of patients that can receive these life-saving treatments, and reduce the burden on healthcare systems.\nJeremy Skillington, PhD, CEO of Poolbeg Pharma, said:\n\"The publication of peer-reviewed clinical data from our LPS challenge trial in Frontiers in Immunology is an important milestone for Poolbeg. The positive data from this trial highlights that oral treatment of POLB 001 holds great promise in addressing cancer immunotherapy-induced CRS and supports further clinical development of the asset, including the POLB 001 TOPICAL clinical trial.\"\nEnquiries\nPoolbeg Pharma Plc\nJeremy Skillington, CEO\nIan O'Connell, CFO\n+44 (0) 207 183 1499\nir@poolbegpharma.com\nCavendish\u202fCapital Markets Ltd\u202f(NOMAD & Joint Broker)\nGeoff Nash, Trisyia Jamaludin (Corporate Finance)\nNigel Birks (Life Science Specialist Sales)\nHarriet Ward\u202f(ECM)\n+44 (0) 207 220 0500\nShore Capital Stockbrokers Ltd (Joint Broker)\nDavid Coaten, Harry Davies-Ball (Corporate Advisory)Malachy McEntyre (Corporate Broking)\n+44 (0) 207 408 4090\nJ&E Davy\u202f(Joint Broker)\nAnthony Farrell,\u202fNiall Gilchrist\n+353 (0) 1 679 6363\nOptimum Strategic Communications\nNick Bastin,\u202fVici Rabbetts, Elena Bates\n+44 (0) 208 078 4357\npoolbeg@optimumcomms.com\nAbout Poolbeg Pharma plc\nPoolbeg Pharma\u00a0plc\u00a0(AIM: POLB) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical\u00a0company with a core focus on transforming the cancer immunotherapy field.

The Company's cash balance of \u00a310.0 million (as at 30 June 2025) will support the delivery of multiple key clinical milestones.\u00a0To align resourcing with these near-term clinical priorities, the Company implemented a series of operational efficiency measures, including selective headcount reductions during the year.\nPOLB 001 - Upcoming TOPICAL trial\nPreparations for the forthcoming POLB 001 TOPICAL trial have advanced at pace, with multiple key milestones achieved in rapid succession:\n\u00b7\nSecured the approved bispecific antibody, teclistamab, for the study from Johnson & Johnson, a top-five global pharmaceutical company, at no cost to the Company\n\u00b7\nSigned an agreement for Accelerating Clinical Trials (ACT) to conduct the trial, led by Dr Emma Searle, Consultant Haematologist at\u00a0The Christie NHS Foundation Trust\n\u00b7\nConfirmed participation from a number of additional cancer centres, including the NHS Foundation Trusts at The Royal Marsden, University College London Hospitals, and University Hospitals Birmingham\n\u00b7\nFinalised the protocol and preparing POLB 001 shipment to trial sites\n\u00b7\nSingle-arm, open-label design enables early insights and safety assessment; interim data expected in summer 2026\nIn December 2025, we announced that the TOPICAL trial will play a key role in the RISE programme, led by University of Manchester and The Christie, which is investigating cancer immunotherapy-induced CRS and the safer delivery of these treatments to patients. Poolbeg is the lead business partner alongside Johnson & Johnson and others. Greatly improved response and survival rates are turning the focus to how these truly lifesaving cancer immunotherapies can be made more widely available, with CRS being one of the largest bottlenecks. The continued growth and dominance of these CRS inducing cancer immunotherapies further enhances the value proposition of POLB 001.\nPartnering focused\nWe are continuing to progress partnering discussions with several major and mid-sized pharmaceutical companies regarding POLB 001 which, the directors believe, addresses a potential market opportunity of >US$10 billion1. We secured Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA earlier this year and also strengthened our intellectual property position with the granting of multiple new patents.\nOral GLP-1 programme\nTopline data from\nthe proof-of-concept clinical trial for our oral GLP-1 programme in up to 20 obese subjects is expected in H1 2026. The trial is due to take place at the\u00a0University of Ulster, led by a team that includes Professor\u00a0Carel le Roux, a notable figure in the field of metabolic medicine.\nWhilst we are currently prioritising the upcoming clinical trials for POLB 001 and our oral GLP-1 programme, we are seeking to progress potential collaborations in our AI-led programmes. AI-driven drug discovery is seeing continued global interest due to its potential in accelerating target identification, reducing costs, de-risking development, and improving success rates.\nOutlook\n2025 has been a remarkable year of significant achievement, positioning Poolbeg strongly to deliver on a series of exciting clinical milestones in 2026. We are well-funded through a catalyst-rich period, with a cash runway into 2027.\nWe would like to thank our shareholders for their continued support, and we look forward to reporting on our progress in 2026.\nCathal Friel,\nExecutive Chair\nEnquiries\nPoolbeg Pharma Plc\nJeremy Skillington, CEO\nIan O'Connell, CFO\n+44 (0) 207 183 1499\nir@poolbegpharma.com\nCavendish\u202fCapital Markets Ltd\u202f(NOMAD & Joint Broker)\nGeoff Nash, Trisyia Jamaludin (Corporate Finance)\nNigel Birks (Life Science Specialist Sales)\nHarriet Ward\u202f(ECM)\n+44 (0) 207 220 0500\nShore Capital Stockbrokers Ltd (Joint Broker)\nDavid Coaten, Harry Davies-Ball (Corporate Advisory)Malachy McEntyre (Corporate Broking)\n+44 (0) 207 408 4090\nJ&E Davy\u202f(Joint Broker)\nAnthony Farrell,\u202fNiall Gilchrist\n+353 (0) 1 679 6363\nOptimum Strategic Communications\nNick Bastin,\u202fVici Rabbetts, Elena Bates\n+44 (0) 208 078 4357\npoolbeg@optimumcomms.com\nAbout POLB 001\nPOLB 001 has the potential to transform the lives of late-stage cancer patients by preventing cancer immunotherapy-induced CRS, a life-threatening side effect that >70% of patients experience2. Due to the risk of CRS, patients have to travel long distances to specialist cancer hospitals and stay for weeks at a time. By preventing CRS, POLB 001 has the potential to allow administration of these drugs to take place in local community hospitals and in an outpatient setting, vastly improving patient quality of life, transforming healthcare systems, and increasing the addressable market for pharma companies.\nAbout Poolbeg Pharma plc\nPoolbeg Pharma\u00a0plc\u00a0(AIM: POLB) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical\u00a0company with a core focus on transforming the cancer immunotherapy field. The Company's lead asset, POLB 001, has the potential to expand administration of cancer immunotherapies from centralised specialist cancer centres into community hospitals by making the treatments safer through the prevention of the life-threatening side effect, Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS).\u00a0As such, POLB 001 could increase the number of patients that can receive these life-saving treatments, thereby increasing the market opportunity. Poolbeg is also advancing the development of a patient-friendly therapy for obesity with an oral encapsulated GLP-1, offering a differentiated approach within one of the world's largest markets. With multiple near-term clinical value inflection points, and an experienced team with a proven track record, Poolbeg is focussed on partnering its high value programmes that are targeting large markets and addressing critical unmet medical needs.\nStay updated:\nWebsite\n|\nSign up for RNS alerts\n|\nPresentation\n|\nX\n|\nLinkedIn\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis announcement\u00a0may contain forward-looking statements and the words \"expect\", \"anticipate\", \"intends\", \"plan\", \"estimate\", \"aim\", \"forecast\", \"project\" and similar expressions (or their negative) identify certain of these forward-looking statements.

RISE will not impact the delivery of data from\nthe POLB 001 clinical trial, anticipated in\nsummer 2026. Poolbeg's participation in this programme will not impact the Company's cash runway into 2027.\nThe programme includes\nthe collection of clinical data from patients treated with bispecific antibodies and CAR T-cell therapies and will involve additional research beyond the TOPICAL trial into the potential of POLB 001 to prevent cancer immunotherapy-induced CRS. The programme reflects the growing recognition of the unmet medical need in the management of CRS and other serious adverse effects, which is a significant bottleneck to the broader availability and uptake of these breakthrough cancer immunotherapies.\nThe RISE programme will be under the leadership of Dr Jonathan Lim, Clinical Senior Lecturer and Honorary Consultant Medical Oncologist in Advanced Immunotherapy and Cell Therapy and conducted at The University of Manchester and The Christie.\nJeremy Skillington, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of Poolbeg Pharma, said:\n\"\nAdvanced immunotherapies are the future of cancer treatment but can come with some severe adverse effects, such as CRS.\nThis programme will deepen the understanding of CRS and could be beneficial for POLB 001, as we seek to bring its potential benefits to patients.\nPoolbeg is delighted to be working alongside\nThe University of Manchester, The Christie, Johnson & Johnson and other leading partners, who are focussed on finding a solution for CRS. The Christie has an ambition to position the UK as a global leader in research focused on the safe delivery of cancer immunotherapies and we are very proud that POLB 001 can play a key part in this.\"\nDr Jonathan Lim, Clinical Senior Lecturer and Honorary Consultant Medical Oncologist in Advanced Immunotherapy and Cell Therapy at the Christie said\n\"RISE harnesses Manchester's multidisciplinary strengths to explore the biology behind both the power and the risks of modern cancer immunotherapies. Supported by the MRC Prosperity Partnership, this initiative exemplifies how academic-industry collaboration can accelerate discovery and ensure these therapies are delivered safely and responsibly.\"\nDr Glenn Wells, MRC Deputy Executive Chair, said:\n\"This project is part of a \u00a39 million public sector investment through MRC's first Prosperity Partnerships. With\nadditional contribution\nfrom industry and close collaboration with key regulatory bodies, we are addressing the safety and toxicity of advanced therapies.
