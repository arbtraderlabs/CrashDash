The Company's cash balance of \u00a310.0 million (as at 30 June 2025) will support the delivery of multiple key clinical milestones.\u00a0To align resourcing with these near-term clinical priorities, the Company implemented a series of operational efficiency measures, including selective headcount reductions during the year.\nPOLB 001 - Upcoming TOPICAL trial\nPreparations for the forthcoming POLB 001 TOPICAL trial have advanced at pace, with multiple key milestones achieved in rapid succession:\n\u00b7\nSecured the approved bispecific antibody, teclistamab, for the study from Johnson & Johnson, a top-five global pharmaceutical company, at no cost to the Company\n\u00b7\nSigned an agreement for Accelerating Clinical Trials (ACT) to conduct the trial, led by Dr Emma Searle, Consultant Haematologist at\u00a0The Christie NHS Foundation Trust\n\u00b7\nConfirmed participation from a number of additional cancer centres, including the NHS Foundation Trusts at The Royal Marsden, University College London Hospitals, and University Hospitals Birmingham\n\u00b7\nFinalised the protocol and preparing POLB 001 shipment to trial sites\n\u00b7\nSingle-arm, open-label design enables early insights and safety assessment; interim data expected in summer 2026\nIn December 2025, we announced that the TOPICAL trial will play a key role in the RISE programme, led by University of Manchester and The Christie, which is investigating cancer immunotherapy-induced CRS and the safer delivery of these treatments to patients. Poolbeg is the lead business partner alongside Johnson & Johnson and others. Greatly improved response and survival rates are turning the focus to how these truly lifesaving cancer immunotherapies can be made more widely available, with CRS being one of the largest bottlenecks. The continued growth and dominance of these CRS inducing cancer immunotherapies further enhances the value proposition of POLB 001.\nPartnering focused\nWe are continuing to progress partnering discussions with several major and mid-sized pharmaceutical companies regarding POLB 001 which, the directors believe, addresses a potential market opportunity of >US$10 billion1. We secured Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA earlier this year and also strengthened our intellectual property position with the granting of multiple new patents.\nOral GLP-1 programme\nTopline data from\nthe proof-of-concept clinical trial for our oral GLP-1 programme in up to 20 obese subjects is expected in H1 2026. The trial is due to take place at the\u00a0University of Ulster, led by a team that includes Professor\u00a0Carel le Roux, a notable figure in the field of metabolic medicine.\nWhilst we are currently prioritising the upcoming clinical trials for POLB 001 and our oral GLP-1 programme, we are seeking to progress potential collaborations in our AI-led programmes. AI-driven drug discovery is seeing continued global interest due to its potential in accelerating target identification, reducing costs, de-risking development, and improving success rates.\nOutlook\n2025 has been a remarkable year of significant achievement, positioning Poolbeg strongly to deliver on a series of exciting clinical milestones in 2026. We are well-funded through a catalyst-rich period, with a cash runway into 2027.\nWe would like to thank our shareholders for their continued support, and we look forward to reporting on our progress in 2026.\nCathal Friel,\nExecutive Chair\nEnquiries\nPoolbeg Pharma Plc\nJeremy Skillington, CEO\nIan O'Connell, CFO\n+44 (0) 207 183 1499\nir@poolbegpharma.com\nCavendish\u202fCapital Markets Ltd\u202f(NOMAD & Joint Broker)\nGeoff Nash, Trisyia Jamaludin (Corporate Finance)\nNigel Birks (Life Science Specialist Sales)\nHarriet Ward\u202f(ECM)\n+44 (0) 207 220 0500\nShore Capital Stockbrokers Ltd (Joint Broker)\nDavid Coaten, Harry Davies-Ball (Corporate Advisory)Malachy McEntyre (Corporate Broking)\n+44 (0) 207 408 4090\nJ&E Davy\u202f(Joint Broker)\nAnthony Farrell,\u202fNiall Gilchrist\n+353 (0) 1 679 6363\nOptimum Strategic Communications\nNick Bastin,\u202fVici Rabbetts, Elena Bates\n+44 (0) 208 078 4357\npoolbeg@optimumcomms.com\nAbout POLB 001\nPOLB 001 has the potential to transform the lives of late-stage cancer patients by preventing cancer immunotherapy-induced CRS, a life-threatening side effect that >70% of patients experience2. Due to the risk of CRS, patients have to travel long distances to specialist cancer hospitals and stay for weeks at a time. By preventing CRS, POLB 001 has the potential to allow administration of these drugs to take place in local community hospitals and in an outpatient setting, vastly improving patient quality of life, transforming healthcare systems, and increasing the addressable market for pharma companies.\nAbout Poolbeg Pharma plc\nPoolbeg Pharma\u00a0plc\u00a0(AIM: POLB) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical\u00a0company with a core focus on transforming the cancer immunotherapy field. The Company's lead asset, POLB 001, has the potential to expand administration of cancer immunotherapies from centralised specialist cancer centres into community hospitals by making the treatments safer through the prevention of the life-threatening side effect, Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS).\u00a0As such, POLB 001 could increase the number of patients that can receive these life-saving treatments, thereby increasing the market opportunity. Poolbeg is also advancing the development of a patient-friendly therapy for obesity with an oral encapsulated GLP-1, offering a differentiated approach within one of the world's largest markets. With multiple near-term clinical value inflection points, and an experienced team with a proven track record, Poolbeg is focussed on partnering its high value programmes that are targeting large markets and addressing critical unmet medical needs.\nStay updated:\nWebsite\n|\nSign up for RNS alerts\n|\nPresentation\n|\nX\n|\nLinkedIn\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis announcement\u00a0may contain forward-looking statements and the words \"expect\", \"anticipate\", \"intends\", \"plan\", \"estimate\", \"aim\", \"forecast\", \"project\" and similar expressions (or their negative) identify certain of these forward-looking statements.

RISE will not impact the delivery of data from\nthe POLB 001 clinical trial, anticipated in\nsummer 2026. Poolbeg's participation in this programme will not impact the Company's cash runway into 2027.\nThe programme includes\nthe collection of clinical data from patients treated with bispecific antibodies and CAR T-cell therapies and will involve additional research beyond the TOPICAL trial into the potential of POLB 001 to prevent cancer immunotherapy-induced CRS. The programme reflects the growing recognition of the unmet medical need in the management of CRS and other serious adverse effects, which is a significant bottleneck to the broader availability and uptake of these breakthrough cancer immunotherapies.\nThe RISE programme will be under the leadership of Dr Jonathan Lim, Clinical Senior Lecturer and Honorary Consultant Medical Oncologist in Advanced Immunotherapy and Cell Therapy and conducted at The University of Manchester and The Christie.\nJeremy Skillington, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of Poolbeg Pharma, said:\n\"\nAdvanced immunotherapies are the future of cancer treatment but can come with some severe adverse effects, such as CRS.\nThis programme will deepen the understanding of CRS and could be beneficial for POLB 001, as we seek to bring its potential benefits to patients.\nPoolbeg is delighted to be working alongside\nThe University of Manchester, The Christie, Johnson & Johnson and other leading partners, who are focussed on finding a solution for CRS. The Christie has an ambition to position the UK as a global leader in research focused on the safe delivery of cancer immunotherapies and we are very proud that POLB 001 can play a key part in this.\"\nDr Jonathan Lim, Clinical Senior Lecturer and Honorary Consultant Medical Oncologist in Advanced Immunotherapy and Cell Therapy at the Christie said\n\"RISE harnesses Manchester's multidisciplinary strengths to explore the biology behind both the power and the risks of modern cancer immunotherapies. Supported by the MRC Prosperity Partnership, this initiative exemplifies how academic-industry collaboration can accelerate discovery and ensure these therapies are delivered safely and responsibly.\"\nDr Glenn Wells, MRC Deputy Executive Chair, said:\n\"This project is part of a \u00a39 million public sector investment through MRC's first Prosperity Partnerships. With\nadditional contribution\nfrom industry and close collaboration with key regulatory bodies, we are addressing the safety and toxicity of advanced therapies. This research is critical to improving how gene, cell-based, and nucleic acid-dependent therapies are developed for conditions such as cancers and rare genetic disorders, so we can make meaningful improvements to patient outcomes.\"\nEnquiries\nPoolbeg Pharma Plc\nJeremy Skillington, CEO\nIan O'Connell, CFO\n+44 (0) 207 183 1499\nir@poolbegpharma.com\nCavendish\u202fCapital Markets Ltd\u202f(NOMAD & Joint Broker)\nGeoff Nash, Trisyia Jamaludin (Corporate Finance)\nNigel Birks (Life Science Specialist Sales)\nHarriet Ward\u202f(ECM)\n+44 (0) 207 220 0500\nShore Capital Stockbrokers Ltd (Joint Broker)\nDavid Coaten, Harry Davies-Ball (Corporate Advisory)Malachy McEntyre (Corporate Broking)\n+44 (0) 207 408 4090\nJ&E Davy\u202f(Joint Broker)\nAnthony Farrell,\u202fNiall Gilchrist\n+353 (0) 1 679 6363\nOptimum Strategic Communications\nNick Bastin,\u202fVici Rabbetts, Elena Bates\n+44 (0) 208 078 4357\npoolbeg@optimumcomms.com\nAbout CRS\nCytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) is a severe and potentially life-threatening side effect of cancer immunotherapies.

The \u00a34.865 million gross proceeds raised,\ntogether with our existing resources,\nextends our cash runway into 2027 and\nwill support the delivery of multiple key clinical milestones\nin oncology and obesity - two areas of high strategic value and growing interest within the pharmaceutical industry - as we continue to progress toward partnering our programmes.\nStrong progress across the pipeline\nPOLB 001 - potential US$10 billion market opportunity1\nPOLB 001 is potentially a breakthrough, orally delivered, p38 MAPK inhibitor to prevent cancer immunotherapy-induced Cytokine Release Syndrome (\"CRS\"), with further life cycle opportunities, including severe influenza. CRS is a severe and potentially life-threatening side effect of cancer immunotherapies. Over 70% of patients undergoing treatment with certain T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies or CAR T-cell therapies are affected.\n2\nDue to the risk of CRS, treatment is restricted to specialist cancer centres causing extended hospitalisation, high consumption of healthcare resources, and ultimately a reduced uptake of treatment due to accessibility or capacity limitations. With no approved therapies for the prevention of cancer immunotherapy-induced CRS, POLB 001 represents a significant opportunity to transform the field of cancer immunotherapies. By making the treatments safer, through the prevention of CRS, administration of cancer immunotherapies can be expanded from centralised specialist cancer centres into community hospitals.\u00a0As such, POLB 001 could increase the number of patients that can receive these life-saving treatments, further increasing the market opportunity.\nAs a preventative therapy for cancer immunotherapy-induced CRS, we believe that POLB 001 has a market opportunity exceeding US$10 billion. This estimate accounts for multiple myeloma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients alone, two indications in which cancer immunotherapies have a dominant position for the treatment of late-stage disease. However, we believe this is a conservative estimate, as the demand for CRS management may increase as immunotherapies are developed for a wider range of haematological malignancies (blood cancers) and solid tumours.\nIn May 2025, the US Food and Drug Administration\u00a0(\"FDA\") granted Orphan Drug Designation to POLB 001 as an oral preventative therapy for T-cell engager bispecific antibody-induced CRS. Orphan Drug Designation provides Poolbeg with potential clinical development and commercialisation benefits, including a seven-year period of US market exclusivity following regulatory approval of POLB 001, waiver\u00a0of\u00a0Prescription Drug User Fee Act\u00a0application fees (valued at over US$4 million), earlier access to Special Protocol Assessment to agree on pivotal trial designs, and the potential for tax credits for qualifying clinical trials.\nPOLB 001 has demonstrated a compelling safety and efficacy profile in both preclinical and clinical settings. Results from the 2023 human LPS challenge trial and 2024\nin vivo\nanimal study have significantly de-risked the upcoming Phase 2a trial. Further favourable data in a new\nin vivo\nanimal study in H1 2025 supported the use of POLB 001 as a preventative for CRS induced by T-cell engaging bispecific antibody therapies such as approved breakthrough therapeutics teclistamab, elranatamab, talquetamab and others.\nPOLB 001 has a favourable safety and tolerability profile and, importantly, it selectively prevents excessive inflammation without immunosuppression, particularly pertinent in vulnerable patient populations, like cancer patients, who must maintain functional immune responses.\nWe signed an agreement for a specialist blood cancer trials organisation, Accelerating Clinical Trials Limited (\"ACT\"), to conduct the upcoming POLB 001 Phase 2a trial\n. We are pleased to have secured\nthe supply of an approved bispecific antibody drug for the trial at no cost to the Company and are now\nat an advanced stage of trial preparations. The study\nwill be led by Dr Emma Searle, Consultant Haematologist at The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, Honorary Senior Lecturer at the University of Manchester, as well as Chair of the British Society of Haematology Research and Grants Committee. The Christie, a leading cancer research institute based in Manchester, and a number of other leading UK specialist cancer centres will participate.\nThis open-label, single-arm trial will evaluate POLB 001 in approximately 30 relapsed, refractory, multiple myeloma patients receiving an approved bispecific antibody. We are encouraged by the interest from leading myeloma clinicians that have expressed interest in participating in the upcoming trial, which reinforces the positive feedback received to date from key opinion leaders in the space.\nWe are on track to deliver clinical data in 2026 and look forward to sharing this data with prospective partners, we see\nstrong potential for partnering on positive data from the forthcoming trial\n. The demand for effective CRS prevention solutions is driven by rapid growth of CRS-inducing cancer immunotherapies, a market which is expected to grow to\u00a0US$120 billion\u00a0by 2030.\n3,4,5\nIn addition, the\u00a0recent FDA Orphan Drug Designation further validates POLB 001's scientific rationale and enhances its commercial appeal for prospective partners. If approved, POLB 001 has the potential to revolutionise cancer immunotherapy delivery by making it safer, enabling administration in community hospitals, reducing healthcare burden, and ultimately expanding patient access to these life-saving treatments.\nOral encapsulated GLP-1 programme targeting the obesity market\nOur oral encapsulated GLP-1 programme leverages a proprietary delivery system that encapsulates APIs (active pharmaceutical ingredients) using Generally Recognised as Safe (GRAS) components. This approach targets delivery to specific areas of the gut and into systemic circulation, with the potential to improve convenience and bioavailability, for the treatment of metabolic disorders, such as obesity. The effectiveness of the technology has already been validated via the commercialisation of encapsulated oral probiotics and nutraceuticals by our partner, AnaBio Technologies.\nObesity has been recognised by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a major global health challenge, reaching epidemic levels. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 42% of the US population is currently affected\n6\n. In 2023, obesity-related issues were estimated to have cost US businesses and their employees around US$347.5 billion\n7\n. These factors have contributed to the rapid rise in demand for prescription weight loss treatments, notably glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (\"GLP-1R\"). The global GLP-1R market is forecast to grow significantly, expected to reach US$150 billion by 2031 across obesity and diabetes indications alone\n8\n.\nOral GLP-1R options remain limited yet highly sought after owing to their non-invasiveness, ease of access and greater patient compliance, particularly those with chronic conditions\u00a0who\u00a0require long-term treatment. There are major shortcomings within currently approved injectable treatment options, with 65% of patients who discontinued GLP-1s within one year stating they would prefer oral alternatives\n9\n. There is currently only one oral GLP-1R agonist on the market with a bioavailability of just c.1%\n10\n.\u00a0Our licensed technology has the potential to overcome challenges associated with oral delivery of peptide-based biologics, offering a differentiated approach within one of the world's largest markets.\nOur proof-of-concept clinical trial will take place at the University of Ulster, led by a team that includes Professor Carel le Roux, a notable figure in the field of metabolic medicine. The trial is designed to generate impactful data, expected in H1 2026, that demonstrates the ability to safely and efficiently deliver our oral GLP-1 in up to 20 obese subjects. We continue to keep potential pharma partners updated on the progress of this trial and we believe there is potential for partnering on positive data. As Poolbeg holds a licence to this proprietary oral encapsulation technology across all metabolic conditions, there is also further partnering opportunities beyond GLP-1 and the successful results from the trial may provide technology validation to support multiple opportunities for value creation.\nArtificial Intelligence (\"AI\") Programmes\nWhilst we are currently prioritising the upcoming clinical trials for POLB 001 and our Oral GLP-1 programme, discussions in respect to potential collaborations of our AI-led programmes are ongoing. AI-driven drug discovery is seeing continued global interest as it has the potential to accelerate target identification, reduce costs, de-risk development, and improve success rates. We successfully identified multiple novel drug targets and new potential drug candidates for Influenza and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (\"RSV\") respectively - with multiple partnering opportunities from each programme.\nFinancial\nDuring the period, the Company strengthened its financial position by completing a\n\u00a34.865m (before expenses) fundraise at 2.5p per share. This resulted in a\ncash balance of\u00a0\u00a310.0 million\u00a0as at\u00a030 June 2025 (30 June 2024: \u00a310.1 million) and extends Poolbeg's financial runway into 2027\nsupporting the delivery of multiple key clinical milestones\n. To align resourcing with these near-term clinical priorities, the Company implemented a series of operational efficiency measures, including selective headcount reductions. These changes are expected to streamline the cost base and maintain focus on the delivery of key clinical milestones through 2026 and into 2027.\nThe loss for the period amounted to\u00a0\u00a32.2 million\u00a0(H1 24:\u00a0\u00a32.3 million) comprised of R&D expenses\u00a0of\u00a0\u00a30.5 million\u00a0(H1 24:\u00a0\u00a30.7 million), administrative expenses\u00a0\u00a32.0 million\u00a0(H1 24:\u00a0\u00a32.1 million), and tax rebates and other income & charges of\u00a0\u00a30.4 million\u00a0(H1 24:\u00a0\u00a30.6 million).\nOutlook\nOur programmes are in areas of high interest within the pharmaceutical industry. We are optimistic about the potential of POLB 001 to transform the delivery of cancer immunotherapies by moving administration away from specialist centralised cancer centres and into the community setting, closer to patients' homes and, as a result, making these life-saving treatments available to more patients. POLB 001 has the potential to make cancer immunotherapies safer by reducing the incidence of cancer immunotherapy-CRS which can be potentially life threatening.\nThis is\nsupported by strong pre-clinical and clinical data generated to date, robust intellectual property, global rights, and FDA Orphan Drug Designation for POLB 001.\nIn addition, our patient-friendly oral encapsulated GLP-1 for obesity offers a differentiated approach within one of the world's largest markets.\nI am excited about Poolbeg's future; we've entered a catalyst-rich period, supported by a robust cash balance that provides runway through to 2027. With a clear plan to deliver shareholder value through our clinical programmes, we are led by a proven team with expertise in clinical execution and deal-making and we see strong potential to secure partnerships based on positive data from our upcoming trials.\nJeremy Skillington\nCEO\n26 September 2025\nReferences\n1.Independent research by Decisive Consulting Limited.\n2.\nAverage rate from Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPCs) for Yescarta, Tecartus, Abecma, Kymriah, Carvykti, Breyanzi, Elrexfio, Columvi, Epkinly, Tecvayli and Talvey;\n3.

General information\nPoolbeg Pharma plc (\"Poolbeg\" or the \"Company\") is a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales with company number 13279507. The Company is listed on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange (ticker: POLB.L, ISIN: GB00BKPG7Z60).\nPoolbeg is\u00a0a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focussed on acquiring, developing and commercialising innovative medicines that will help improve the lives of patients with serious diseases and where there is a high unmet medical need.\n2. Basis of preparation\nThe Interim Results of the Company for the six months to 30 June 2025 comprise those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together the \"Group\"). The Interim Results have been prepared on the going concern basis under the historical cost convention in accordance with the recognition and measurement requirements of United Kingdom adopted\nInternational Accounting Standards (\"IFRS\") and their interpretations issued by the International Accounting\nStandards Board (\"IASB\"), and in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS\n. As is permitted by the AIM rules, the Directors have not adopted the requirements of IAS 34 \"Interim Financial Reporting\" in preparing the financial statements. Accordingly, the financial statements are not in full compliance with IFRS and have neither been audited nor reviewed pursuant to guidance issued by the Auditing Practices Board.\nThe financial information for the six months to 30 June 2025 and 30 June 2024 is unaudited. The\ninformation for the year ended 31 December 2024 has been extracted from the Company's audited accounts on which the auditors issued an unqualified audit opinion. The information presented for that period does not constitute full accounts for that period. The 31 December 2024 audited accounts have been delivered to the Companies House.\nThe financial information is presented in \u00a3 which is the functional and presentational currency of the Company. Balances are rounded to the nearest thousand (\u00a3'000) except where otherwise indicated.\nThe Interim Results were approved by the Board of Directors on 26 September 2025.\nThe accounting policies used in the preparation of the Interim Results are consistent with those used in the Company's audited financial statements for the year to 31 December 2024.\n3. Loss per share - basic and diluted\nThe Group presents basic and diluted loss per share (\"LPS\") data for its ordinary shares. Basic LPS is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted LPS is determined by adjusting the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which comprise warrants and share options granted by the Company.\nIssued share capital - ordinary shares of 0.02p each\nShare Issue Details\nNumber of shares\nWeighted average shares\n30 June 2024 & 31 December 2024\n500,000,000\n500,000,000\n25 June 2025 - share placing & fee shares\n197,200,000\n30 June 2025\n697,200,000\n506,537,017\nOn 25 June 2025, 194,600,000 ordinary shares of 0.02p were issued at 2.5p per share as part of a \u00a34,865,000 (before expenses) fund raising. In addition, as part of the fundraising arrangements, the Company issued 2,600,000 ordinary shares at the issue price to advisors in lieu of advisory fees.\nThe calculation of loss per share is based on the following:\nUnaudited\nSix months ended\n30 June 2025\nUnaudited\nSix months ended\n30 June 2024\nAudited\nYear ended\n31 December 2024\nLoss after tax attributable to equity holders of the Company (\u00a3'000)\n(2,178)\n(2,258)\n(5,790)\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares in issue\n506,537,017\n500,000,000\n500,000,000\nFully diluted average number of ordinary shares in issue\n506,537,017\n500,000,000\n500,000,000\nBasic and diluted loss per share\n(0.43)p\n(0.45)p\n(1.16)p\nUnder IAS 33.43 \"Earnings per Share\", the calculation of loss per share does not assume conversion, exercise, or other issue of potential shares that would have an antidilutive effect on LPS. For the current and comparative periods, the effect of options would be to reduce the loss per share and as such the basic and diluted LPS are the same. There were 65,076,600 share options and warrants outstanding as at 30 June 2025 (30 June 2024 and 31 December 2024: 65,076,600) and these are potentially dilutive.\n4.

The Christie, a leading cancer research institute based in Manchester, and a number of other leading UK specialist cancer centres will participate.\nThe Phase 2a first-in-patient\nopen-label, single-arm trial is titled TOPICAL (Trial\u00a0of Prevention of ImmunoCytokine Adverse events in Myeloma). The study aims to investigate the safety and efficacy of POLB 001, in particular its ability to reduce the incidence of\nCytokine Release Syndrome (\"CRS\")\nin approximately 30 relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients receiving an approved bispecific antibody.\nT\nhe Company already has sufficient supply of Good Manufacturing Practice (\"GMP\") grade POLB 001 and this agreement represents an advanced stage of trial preparation, with interim data anticipated in summer 2026. The Company's forecast cash runway extends into 2027, providing more than adequate funding to achieve key clinical development milestones.\nThe Directors believe that POLB 001 has the potential to transform the cancer immunotherapy field by expanding administration from centralised specialist cancer centres into community hospitals by making the treatments safer through the prevention of the life-threatening side effect, CRS. As such, POLB 001 could increase the number of patients that can receive these life-saving treatments, thereby increasing the market opportunity.\nJeremy Skillington, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of\u00a0Poolbeg Pharma, said:\n\"The signing of this agreement, and the supply of the approved bispecific antibody at no cost to the Company, are major milestones for the upcoming POLB 001 Phase 2a trial. The trial is at an advanced stage of preparation and remains on track to deliver data in 2026, we look forward to sharing the data with prospective partners. With a cash runway into 2027, and multiple near-term clinical inflection points, we believe that we are well positioned to deliver value for our shareholders.\"\n\"We are optimistic about the potential of POLB 001 to transform the delivery of cancer immunotherapies by expanding administration away from specialist centralised cancer centres and into the community setting, closer to patients' homes. This shift could make these life-saving treatments more widely accessible. POLB 001 has the potential to make cancer immunotherapies safer by reducing the incidence of potentially life-threatening cancer immunotherapy-induced cytokine release syndrome.\"\nDr\u00a0Emma Searle, MBChB MA MRCP FRCPath PhD, Consultant Haematologist at The Christie NHS Foundation Trust, and Chief Investigator of the forthcoming POLB 001 trial said:\n\"I have seen first-hand the challenges that CRS presents to the delivery of cancer immunotherapies, requiring many of our patients to be hospitalised for treatment. These transformative therapies will continue to be restricted until there is a way to administer them more safely. POLB 001 holds great promise in tackling this issue; potentially leading to improved patient wellbeing, reducing the strain on healthcare systems while making these treatments more accessible to a broader patient population.\"\nDr Paul Sherrington, CEO of Accelerating Clinical Trials Ltd said:\n\"At ACT we work hand-in-hand with the haematological community to accelerate the delivery of clinical trials of new therapies, leveraging our wide network of research centres in the UK. We look forward to completing this study with POLB 001 which holds great potential to transform the cancer immunotherapy field and address this critical unmet medical need.\"\nMarket Opportunity\nThe demand for effective CRS prevention solutions is driven by the rapid growth of CRS-inducing cancer immunotherapies with more than 70% of patients receiving certain cancer immunotherapies affected. Independent research has identified a market opportunity of >US$10 billion for POLB 001 and as such, the Company sees\nstrong potential for partnering on positive data from the forthcoming trial\n. The\u00a0recent FDA Orphan Drug Designation further validates POLB 001's scientific rationale and enhances its commercial appeal for prospective partners.\nInvestor presentation\nPoolbeg Pharma\u00a0will provide a live presentation\u00a0via the\u00a0Investor Meet Company\u00a0platform on Monday 29 September 2025\u00a0at\u00a05pm.\nThe presentation is open to analysts and investors, those who already follow Poolbeg on the\u00a0Investor Meet Company\u00a0platform will automatically be invited.\u00a0Investors can sign up to Investor Meet for free and add\u00a0Poolbeg Pharma\u00a0plc\u00a0to their company dashboard\nhere\n.\nEnquiries\nPoolbeg Pharma Plc\nJeremy Skillington, CEO\nIan O'Connell, CFO\n+44 (0) 207 183 1499\nir@poolbegpharma.com\nCavendish\u202fCapital Markets Ltd\u202f(NOMAD & Joint Broker)\nGeoff Nash, Trisyia Jamaludin\u00a0(Corporate Finance)\nNigel Birks (Life Science Specialist Sales)\nHarriet Ward\u202f(ECM)\n+44 (0) 207 220 0500\nShore Capital Stockbrokers Ltd\u00a0(Joint Broker)\nDavid Coaten, Harry Davies-Ball (Corporate Advisory)Malachy McEntyre\n(Corporate Broking)\n+44 (0) 207 408 4090\nJ&E Davy\u202f(Joint Broker)\nAnthony Farrell,\u202fNiall Gilchrist\n+353 (0) 1 679 6363\nOptimum Strategic Communications\nNick Bastin,\u202fVici Rabbetts, Elena Bates\n+44 (0) 208 078 4357\npoolbeg@optimumcomms.com\nAbout Poolbeg Pharma plc\nPoolbeg Pharma\u00a0plc\u00a0(AIM: POLB) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical\u00a0company with a core focus on transforming the cancer immunotherapy field.
