Dunbar's business is focused on the provision of so-called 'behind the meter' on-site electricity generation, and the deployment of modular compute facilities, to provide a diverse range of energy and infrastructure solutions for the high-performance computing industry. Modular compute facilities are data centres built from pre-engineered, factory-made components that can be quickly deployed, scaled and relocated, offering greater agility, cost-efficiency and adaptability for modern IT needs like AI.\nAlthough demand for datacentres and compute sites continues to grow rapidly, not least due to the rapid development of AI, it is hampered by the greatly increased demand for the large amounts of electricity they consume. Dunbar addresses this by establishing its sites close to gas wells it will control that are able to produce gas that is typically too remote from the main gas pipeline networks to be cost-effectively monetised.\nSuch gas can be efficiently converted into electricity on-site, reducing the need for the compute facilities to have to draw power from an increasingly overstretched electricity supply grid - hence the expression 'behind-the-meter'.\nPost balance sheet events\nAfter our CVA Supervisor settled claims from preferential creditors such as HMRC, the CVA was finally completed on 8 October 2025, with 'debt for equity' shares issued in exchange for the \u00a31.4m liabilities and the remaining \u00a345k of convertible loans, leaving the Company debt free.\nDetailed discussions have continued since reaching the agreement in principle to acquire Dunbar, reflecting on-going developments in Dunbar's business opportunities and asset acquisitions.\nFinalising these discussions has delayed the due diligence process and therefore the signing of definitive legal agreements. However, we expect the proposed RTO to be put to shareholders for approval in the first quarter of 2026.\nWe look forward to updating shareholders in due course.\nGrahame Cook\nChair\n31 December 2025\nDIRECTORS REPORT\nFinancial review\nThe results for the period are set out on page 10. For the six months ended 30 September 2025, the Company reports a net profit of \u00a3900k (2024: net loss of \u00a34,268k) for the Company and its subsidiaries ('\nGroup\n').\nDuring the six months ended 30 September 2025, the Company incurred one-off expenses in respect of the proposal to acquire US energy company Dunbar Energy Inc. in an all-share RTO, subject (inter alia) to due diligence and approval by the Company's shareholders.\nCurrent liabilities of \u00a31.4m included in the Company's and Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at 31 March 2025 were derecognised in April 2025 following proposals for the Company's CVA becoming unconditional. These liabilities therefore no longer existed after April 2025 and the derecognition of these has been credited to the Income Statement.\nDuring the period, the Group incurred a net cash inflow of \u00a3297k (2024: outflow of \u00a330k). At 30 September 2025, the Company held cash at bank of \u00a3537k.\nNo dividends were paid. The directors do not recommend payment of an interim dividend.\nBasis of preparation\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. See note 2.3 for key matters assessed by the Directors in determining that the half-year financial statements should be prepared on a going concern basis.\nRichard Horwood\nDirector\n31 December 2025\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2025\nNote\nSix months ended\n30/9/25\nSix months ended 30/9/24\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nContinuing operations\nOther income:\n- Derecognition of liabilities\n4\n1,351\n-\nAdministration expenses:\n- Acquisition costs\n- Other costs\n6\n(259)\n(193)\n(585)\n-\nOperating profit / (loss)\n899\n(585)\nFinance costs\n(1)\n(5)\nFinance income- interest received\n2\n3\nProfit / (loss) before income tax\n900\n(587)\nIncome tax\n-\n-\nProfit / (loss) for the period from continuing operations\n900\n(587)\nLoss from discontinued operations\n7\n-\n(3,681)\nProfit / (loss) for the period\nOther comprehensive income:\n900\n(4,268)\nItems that may be reclassified to profit or loss\nGains on translation of foreign operations\n-\n28\nProfit / (loss) and other comprehensive income for the period\n900\n(4,240)\nEarnings (loss) per share:\nBasic (pence) - continuing operations\n8\n0.05\n-\nBasic (pence) - discontinued operations\n-\n(2.13)\nDiluted (pence)\n0.04\n(2.13)\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\nAs at 30 September 2025\nAt\n30 Sept 2025\nAt\n31 March 2025\nNote\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n(unaudited)\n(audited)\nNON-CURRENT ASSETS\nProperty, plant and equipment\n2\n3\nCURRENT ASSETS\nReceivables and prepayments\n130\n9\nAssets classified as held for sale\n12\n32\n32\nCash and cash equivalents\n537\n240\n699\n281\nTOTAL ASSETS\n701\n284\nSHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY\nShare capital\n9\n1,481\n1,286\nShare premium\nForeign currency translation reserve\n9\n4,585\n(56)\n3,704\n(56)\nShare-based payment reserve\n9\n84\n64\nAccumulated losses\n(6,128)\n(7,028)\nTOTAL EQUITY- (deficiency)\n(34)\n(2,030)\nCURRENT LIABILITIES\nBorrowings\n10\n45\n55\nTrade and other payables\n11\n85\n1,404\nLiabilities classified as held for sale\n12\n570\n570\nShares to be issued\n35\n285\nTOTAL LIABILITIES\n735\n2,314\nTOTAL EQUITY AND LIABILITIES\n701\n284\nThese financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors and authorised for issue on 31 December 2025 and were signed on its behalf by:\nRichard Horwood, Director\nCompany number 13288812\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2025\nShare capital\nShare premium\nRetained losses\nShare-based payment reserve\nForeign currency trans-lation reserve\nTotals\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nAt 1 April 2025\n1,286\n3,704\n(7,028)\n64\n(56)\n(2,030)\nChanges in equity\nNew shares issued during the period\n195\n920\n-\n-\n-\n1,115\nCosts of share issues\n-\n(39)\n-\n-\n-\n(39)\nShare based payments\n-\n-\n-\n20\n-\n20\nProfit for the period\n-\n-\n900\n-\n-\n900\nAt 30 September 2025\n(unaudited)\n1,481\n4,585\n(6,128)\n84\n(56)\n(34)\nAt 1 April 2024\n(audited)\n289\n949\n(2,146)\n-\n-\n(908)\nChange in equity\nNew shares issued during the period\n927\n2,700\n-\n-\n-\n3,627\nShare based payments\n-\n-\n-\n49\n-\n49\nForeign exchange translation gains\n-\n-\n-\n-\n28\n28\nLoss for the period\n-\n-\n(4,268)\n-\n-\n(4,268)\nAt 30 September 2024\n(unaudited)\n1,216\n3,649\n(6,414)\n49\n28\n(1,472)\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2025\n6 months\nended\n30 Sept\n2025\n6 months\nended\n30 Sept\n2024\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nCash flow from operating activities\n(unaudited)\n(unaudited)\nProfit / (loss) for the period\n900\n(4,268)\nAdjustments for:\nDerecognition of CVA liabilities\n(1,351)\n-\nFinance costs\n-\n5\nFinance income\n(2)\n(3)\nShare-based payment charges\n20\n49\nDepreciation charges\n-\n1\nImpairment of goodwill\n-\n2,269\nForeign currency differences\n-\n(28)\n(Increase) / decrease in other receivables\n(117)\n74\nIncrease in trade and other payables\n94\n535\nNet cash used in operating activities\n(456)\n(1,366)\nCash flow from investing activities\nFinance income\n2\n3\nNet cash from investing activities\n2\n3\nCash flow from financing activities\nProceeds from issue of shares\n751\n1,323\nNet proceeds from borrowings\n-\n10\nNet cash from financing activities\n751\n1,333\nNet increase / (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n297\n(30)\nCash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period\n240\n-\nCash acquired on acquisition of subsidiaries\n-\n53\nCash and cash equivalents at the end of the period\n537\n23\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2025\n1.

Further to the Company's announcement of 24 December 2024 regarding the liquidation of 3radical, the Company's operating subsidiary, the Company was reclassified as a cash shell pursuant to Rule 15 of the AIM Rules. Restoration of trading in its Ordinary shares on AIM took place on 2 April 2025, and was suspended again on 25 June 2025 as it had not acquired a new trading company within 6 months of its becoming a cash shell.\nFollowing approval of the Company's CVA on 27 March 2025 and the Company's main subsidiary 3radical being put into liquidation, the principal activity of the Company during the period to 30 September 2025 was that of identifying potential companies, businesses, or assets for acquisition. The 3radical liquidation is currently in progress with the value of asset realisations to be confirmed on completion, which the directors are advised is expected in the first half of 2026.\nThe functional and presentational currency is Great British Pounds Sterling ('\n\u00a3\n') and the financial statements have been rounded to nearest thousands of pounds (\u00a3'000).\n2. Significant accounting policies\nThe following significant accounting policies have been applied:\n2.1 Basis of preparation\nThese half-year financial statements for the Company and its subsidiaries ('the\nGroup\n') have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the recognition and measurement requirements of UK adopted International Financial Reporting Standards (UK adopted IFRS).\nIn December 2024, 3radical, the Company's main subsidiary was put into liquidation. The directors also restructured the operations and debt of the Company through a CVA in March 2025 which was formally completed in October 2025. Assets are held at their net realisable value. Liabilities are stated at their expected settlement amount.\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2025 (continued)\n2. Accounting policies (continued)\n2.2 3 radical Limited - liquidation basis of accounting\nAs 3radical has been placed into administration and a creditors' voluntary liquidation ('\nCVL\n'), the financial position and results relating to this company and its subsidiary entities at 30 September 2025 have been accounted for on a basis other than going concern in the condensed consolidated financial statements for the period ended 30 September 2025. Accordingly, all assets and liabilities relating to these companies have been classified as current, and assets have been written down to their estimated realisable value at 30 September 2025.\n2.3 Going Concern\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Board has assessed the Company's financial position as at 30 September 2025 and the factors which may impact the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements.\nAs at 30 September 2025, the Group had a deficiency in total equity of \u00a334,000. Excluding other income from the derecognition of liabilities arising from the CVA, the Group generated a loss for the period ended 30 September 2025 of \u00a3451,000 and a net cash outflow from operating activities of \u00a3456,000. The deficiency in equity of \u00a334,000 at 30 September 2025 was after current liabilities of \u00a31.4 million were derecognised in April 2025 following proposals for the Company's CVA becoming unconditional. These liabilities therefore no longer existed after April 2025.\nAs at 30 September 2025, liabilities include approximately \u00a3533k classified as held for sale for the 3radical Group. These entities are in liquidation and the Company has no obligation to settle these amounts.\nIn assessing the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern and pay its debts as and when they fall due, the directors have taken into consideration the following matters:\nOn 13 October 2025, the CVA was completed with 236,782,175 new Ordinary shares issued in satisfaction of all the CVA debts, and the outstanding \u00a345,000 of CLNs were converted into 306,665,817 new Ordinary shares, leaving the Company completely free of all its pre-CVA debts.\nManagement and the directors have considered each of these matters and what the enlarged Group (Electric Guitar PLC as potentially enlarged by the RTO of Dunbar) is expected to look like following the completion of the anticipated RTO, which will only be completed on the basis that the transaction includes sufficient working capital for the enlarged Group's requirements for at least 12 months after completion of the RTO.\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2025 (continued)\n2. Accounting policies (continued)\nThe directors have also assessed the Company's ability to continue as a standalone entity in the event no acquisition is pursued and completed in the period to December 2026.\nCashflow projections have also been prepared on this basis which support the directors' view that the Company has sufficient facilities to meet its obligations for the period to 31 December 2026 and pay its debts as they fall due. There is, however, no guarantee the directors would be successful in raising additional financing for its future growth and working capital should this be required. This matter indicates that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern at the time of approval of the condensed financial statements.\nThe key matters assessed by the directors in considering the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for the period to 31 December 2026 are summarised below.\n-\nThe directors have assessed the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern both as a standalone entity (should the anticipated RTO not complete) and in the anticipated scenario where the RTO of Dunbar concludes. The proposed terms of the Dunbar acquisition include a condition requiring Dunbar to have raised sufficient working capital for the enlarged Group for 18 months. There is however no guarantee that the proposed transaction will be completed in accordance with the proposed terms or that the Group, as enlarged by the RTO of Dunbar, will perform in accordance with any projections prepared for the period following completion.\n-\nManagement has prepared detailed cashflow forecasts for the Company on a standalone basis (should the anticipated RTO not proceed to completion) and the management of Dunbar is preparing similar forecasts for the enlarged Group for the 18-month period following completion of the proposed RTO of Dunbar. Before entering into binding contracts to acquire Dunbar, the directors will review and approve Dunbar's forecasts, following thorough testing of them by the Company's RTO reporting accountants.\n-\nAs part of its assessment of the forecasts, certain sensitivity analyses will be run on the forecast model for the enlarged Group. In the event the enlarged Group's actual sales for the period ending 12 months after completion of the proposed RTO would be lower than forecast and certain controllable costs were to be deferred, the tests will be required to show that the Group should still have the ability to operate and pay its debts as and when they fall due for the same period as above, but this cannot be guaranteed.\n-\nIn the event that the proposed RTO does not proceed, and no other acquisitions are pursued in the year to 31 December 2026, the Company would continue to be a cash shell. As noted above, the standalone forecasts prepared by the Company show that the Company has sufficient facilities to meet its obligations for the period to 31 December 2026 and pay its debts as they fall due.\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2025 (continued)\n2. Accounting policies (continued)\n-\nThere is, however, no guarantee the directors would be successful in raising additional financing for its future growth and working capital should this be required.\nThe financial statements do not include adjustments should the going concern basis be inappropriate. Nonetheless, in view of the successful track record of raising financing in the last year from both equity and debt sources and other available funding options, the directors are confident they would be successful in raising any necessary financing within the next 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements.\nFor these reasons, the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.\n2.4 Basis of consolidation\nThe financial statements of the Group consolidate the results of the Company and its subsidiary entities. A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its influence over the entity.\nThe financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the condensed consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases.\nThe consolidated financial statements present the results of the Company and its subsidiaries (the Group) as if they formed a single entity. Intercompany transactions and balances, including unrealised gains/losses between group companies are therefore eliminated in full.\nWhere the Group ceases to control a subsidiary, the subsidiary is deconsolidated from the date which control ceases. The net assets of the subsidiary are included in a disposal calculation along with any consideration received from the disposal, with any gain or loss recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n2.5 Cash and cash equivalent\ns\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank.\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2025 (continued)\n2. Accounting policies (continued)\n2.6 Share capital and share premium\nShare capital represents the nominal value of shares that have been issued. Share premium includes any premiums received on issue of share capital. Any transactions costs associated with the issuing of shares are deducted from share premium.\n2.7 Provisions for liabilities\nProvisions are made where an event has taken place that gives the group a legal or constructive obligation that requires settlement by a transfer of economic benefit, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\nProvisions are charged as an expense to the income statement in the period that the group becomes aware of the obligation and are measured at the best estimate at the reporting date of the expenditure required to settle the obligation, after taking into account relevant risks and uncertainties. When payments are eventually made, they are charged to the provision carried in the balance sheet.\n2.8 Trade and other payables\nTrade and other payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Accruals and accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n2.9 Financial liabilities\nAll financial liabilities are recognised in the condensed consolidated statement of financial position when the Company or its subsidiaries becomes party to the contractual provision of a financial instrument.\nFinancial liabilities measured at amortised cost\nFinancial liabilities held at amortised cost comprise trade payables and other payables and borrowings.\nThese financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value net of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the instrument. Such interest-bearing liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, which ensures that any interest expense over the period to repayment is at a market rate on the balance of the liability carried in the condensed consolidated statement of financial position.\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2025 (continued)\n2. Accounting policies (continued)\n2.9 Financial liabilities (continued)\nSubsequent measurement\nThe amortised cost of a financial liability is the amount at which the financial liability is measured on initial recognition, minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using effective interest method of any difference between the initial amount recognised and the maturity amount. Such amortisation amounts are recognised in the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Due to the short-term nature of trade and other payables, they are stated at their nominal value, which approximates their fair value.\n2.10 Employee benefits\nThe costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense. The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee's services are received.\n2.11 Business combinations\nThe condensed consolidated half-year financial statements incorporate the results of Electric Guitar plc and its subsidiaries as at 30 September 2025 and for the six months period then ended using the acquisition method of accounting.\nBusiness combinations falling within the scope of IFRS 3 Business Combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the group.\nThe Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as the fair value of the consideration transferred less the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nCosts relating to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of equity instruments, are expensed as incurred.\n3. Critical accounting judgements and estimates\nThe preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with UK adopted IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise their judgment in applying the Company's accounting policies.\nEstimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including future conditions that are assessed to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2025 (continued)\n3. Critical accounting judgements and estimates (continued)\nCritical accounting judgements applied by the directors in preparing these half-year financial statements are disclosed in the basis of preparation (Note 2.1), basis other than going concern (Note 2.3) accounting policies and the derecognition of liabilities described in Note 4 .\n4.\nOther income\n6 months ended\n30 Sept 2025\n6 months ended\n30 Sept 2024\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nDerecognition of liabilities\n1,351\n-\n1,351\n-\nCurrent liabilities of \u00a31.4m included in the Company's and Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at 31 March 2025 have been derecognised in April 2025 following proposals for the Company's CVA becoming unconditional. These liabilities therefore no longer existed after April 2025.\nThe CVA Supervisor completed the administration of the CVA, and the Company issued the fixed pool of 236,782,175 new Ordinary shares to its former creditors, representing 8.6 per cent. of the enlarged equity, as approved by its creditors and members in full satisfaction of its pre-CVA liabilities. The outstanding balance of the emergency convertible loans was at the same time automatically converted into 306,665,817 new Ordinary shares, fully eliminating the rest of the Company's pre-CVA debts.\n5.\nEmployees and directors' remuneration\n6 months ended\n30 Sept 2025\n6 months ended\n30 Sept 2024\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nWages and salaries\n48\n587\nSocial security costs\n-\n64\nOther pension costs\n-\n6\n48\n657\n6.\nAcquisition costs\nDuring the six months ended 30 September 2025, the Company incurred one-off expenses in respect of the proposal to acquire U.S. energy company Dunbar Energy Inc. in an all-share RTO, subject (inter alia) to due diligence and approval by the Company's shareholders.\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2025 (continued)\nIn the comparative six month period to 30 September 2024, the Company incurred costs in connection with the acquisition of subsidiaries and admission to AIM.\n6 months ended\n30 Sept 2025\n6 months ended\n30 Sept 2024\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nProfessional fees - purchase of subsidiaries\n-\n520\nListing fees\n-\n15\nOther professional fees\n259\n50\n259\n585\n7.\nDiscontinued operations\nResults of discontinued activities\n6\nmonths\nended\n30 Sept\n2025\n6 months\nended\n30 Sept 2024\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nRevenue\n-\n57\nCost of sales\n-\n(34)\nGross profit\n-\n23\nImpairment of goodwill\n-\n(2,269)\nAdministrative expenses\n-\n(1,433)\nOperating loss\n-\n(3,679)\nFinance costs\n-\n(2)\nLoss before income tax\n-\n-\nIncome tax\n-\n-\nNet loss for the year from discontinued operations\n-\n(3,681)\nCash flows used in discontinued operations\nNet cash used in operating activities\n-\n(772)\nNet cash used in investing activities\n-\n-\nNet cash from financing activities\n-\n738\nNet cash used in discontinued operations\n(34)\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2025 (continued)\n8.\nEarnings / (loss) per share\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit/ (loss) attributable in the period to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of Ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding any Ordinary shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares.\n6 months\nended\n30 Sept\n2025\n6 months\nended\n30 Sept\n2024\nProfit / (loss) for the period attributable to equity holders of the Company (\u00a3'000):\n-\nContinuing activities\n900\n-\n-\nDiscontinued activities\n-\n(4,268)\nWeighted average number of Ordinary shares (basic)\n1,771,471,843\n200,322,398\nWeighted average number of Ordinary shares (diluted)\n2,105,960,653\n200,322,398\nBasic earnings / (loss) per share (pence):\n-\nContinuing activities\n0.05\n-\n-\nDiscontinued activities\n-\n(2.13)\n0.05\n(2.13)\nDiluted earnings / (loss) per share (pence):\n-\nContinuing activities\n0.04\n-\n-\nDiscontinued activities\n-\n(2.13)\n0.04\n(2.13)\nFor the comparative period, share warrants issued by the Company have an anti-dilutive effect on loss per share.

(\"\nDunbar\n\"), which would constitute a reverse takeover under the AIM Rules for Companies (the \"\nRTO\n\"). Dunbar's business is focused on the provision of 'behind the meter' on-site\nelectricity generation, and the deployment of modular compute facilities, to provide a diverse range of energy and infrastructure solutions for the high-performance computing industry.\nDetailed discussions have continued since reaching the agreement in principle announced on 18 July 2025, reflecting on-going developments in Dunbar's business opportunities and asset acquisitions. While finalising these discussions has delayed the due diligence process and therefore the signing of definitive legal agreements, the Board expects the proposed RTO to be put to shareholders for approval in the first quarter of 2026, and further updates will be provided as necessary.\nThe Company's shares remain suspended from trading on AIM pending the execution of final legally binding documents, publication of an AIM Admission Document, approval by shareholders of Electric Guitar at a general meeting of the Company of the RTO and a waiver of the obligations that would otherwise arise under Rule 9 of the Takeover Code (also subject to approval by the Takeover Panel), and re-admission of the Company's ordinary shares to trading on AIM. There is no guarantee that the proposed RTO will proceed nor as to its final terms or timing. Further announcements will be made as appropriate.\nThe Company expects to publish its unaudited interim results for the six months ended 30 September 2025 before the end of December 2025 in accordance with Rule 18 of the AIM Rules for Companies.\nContacts:\nElectric Guitar PLC\nRichard Horwood\ninfo@electricguitarplc.com\nAllenby Capital (Nominated Adviser and Joint Broker)\nJeremy Porter / Piers Shimwell (Corporate Finance)\nAmrit Nahal / Kelly Gardiner (Equity Sales & Corporate Broking)\n020 3328 5656\nAlbR Capital (Joint Broker)\nJon Belliss / Colin Rowbury\n020 3026 0320\nImportant notices\nThis announcement may include statements that are, or may be deemed to be, \"forward-looking statements\".

Electric Guitar had agreed to acquire 3radical in July 2023.\n\u00b7\nIn August 2024, the Company acquired 3radical's sales & marketing service provider Mymyne Limited ('\nMymyne\n') in an all-share acquisition.\n\u00b7\nIn November 2024, trading in the Company's shares was suspended pending clarification of the Company's financial position following a sudden downturn in 3radical's trading projections and a lack of sufficient alternative funding, and 3radical was placed into administration.\n\u00b7\nIn December 2024, after unsuccessfully seeking buyers for its business, 3radical was placed into Creditors Voluntary Liquidation ('\nCVL\n'), and the Company then automatically became an AIM Rule 15 cash shell and reverted to being a Special Purpose Acquisition Company ('\nSPAC\n') while exploring refinancing options.\n\u00b7\nIn March 2025, the Company's shareholders and creditors approved a Creditors Voluntary Arrangement ('\nCVA\n') and the subdivision of the nominal value of its shares from 0.5p per share to 0.01p per share, facilitating a \u00a3300,000 equity refinancing as a cash shell; eliminating the Company's pre-CVA liabilities; and providing sufficient working capital for its shares to be restored to trading on AIM.\n\u00b7\nAs at 31 March 2025, the Company had \u00a3240,000 in net cash on its balance sheet and \u00a350,000 in other assets, having written off all its investment in its previous acquisitions.\nPost balance sheet events highlights\n\u00b7\nIn April 2025, the Company completed the \u00a3300,000 share subscription, and (following the Company's CVA becoming unconditional) the current liabilities of \u00a31.4 million on the 31 March 2025 balance sheet were derecognised.\n\u00b7\nIn June 2025, the Company raised a further \u00a3775,000 to fund the anticipated costs of executing a further acquisition.\n\u00b7\nIn July 2025, the Company announced an agreement in principle to acquire Dunbar Energy Inc.

As a SPAC, its strategy is to invest in and/or acquire companies which show significant potential for growth, cash-generation, and a profitable exit in the medium term.\nFor further information please visit\nwww.electricguitarplc.com\n.\nCHAIR'S STATEMENT AND OPERATIONAL REPORT\nFor the year ended 31 March 2025\nI present the Company's Annual Report and Audited Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2025.\nIt has been a year of contrasting fortunes for the Company. It started with the Company as a cash shell and its shares already long-suspended on the Standard Segment of the FCA Official List and Main Market of the London Stock Exchange, following the announcement in July 2023 of its agreement in principle to acquire marketing technology company 3radical.\nThat 9-month suspension reflected very difficult stock market conditions, and in particular the falling out of favour of SPAC vehicles, at that time, which made raising significant funding difficult.\nThe Company's mission had been well conceived and, on its acquisition, 3radical offered a promising base from which to grow. A trailblazer in digital consumer engagement solutions and based in the UK, 3radical had an operation in Singapore and customers across the UK, US and Asia-Pacific, making it an attractive platform on which to build, and fitting our strategy of capitalising on structural disruption in the marketing industry.\nAfter acquiring 3radical, the management team immediately enhanced its sales and marketing activities, brought in additional experienced management, and bore down on non-revenue-generating overheads. But the combined effect of the lack of investment in 3radical during the long delay leading up to its acquisition, and a continuing tough macroeconomic environment coupled with a volatile political landscape, and the Company's share price falling substantially after the RTO which inhibited further fundraisings and acquisitions as part of the Company's core 'buy-and-build' strategy, together made fulfilment of its mission extremely challenging.\nDespite this backdrop, the Company succeeded in the all-share acquisition of Mymyne in August 2024. Mymyne already had a contract to provide sales and marketing services to 3radical, and its acquisition delivered substantial cost-savings and synergies as well as potentially valuable IP. The Company also established several new collaborations for additional products, technologies and access to new markets. But other more substantial acquisitions were frustrated by a falling share price and challenging equity markets.\nWith the prospect of further UK stock market capital raisings becoming increasingly remote, the Board engaged in private placing fundraising discussions which were initially very encouraging, only for the lead prospective investor to withdraw following a collapse of the Company's share price.\nThe termination of funding discussions and a downgrading by 3radical's management of its revenue projections following the UK Government's 30 October 2024 Budget that damaged business confidence, left the Board with no option but to have 3radical placed into administration, and to request the suspension of the Company's shares from trading pending clarification of its financial position. After 3radical's administrator had unsuccessfully marketed the 3radical business as a going concern, it was placed into a CVL on 24 December 2024, and the Company then automatically became an AIM Rule 15 cash shell.\nThe Board was determined to preserve as much value as it could for the Company's shareholders, while also addressing the rights and concerns of its creditors. Emergency short term convertible loans totalling \u00a355,000 were secured to enable the Company to prepare a restructuring.\nLed from this point by Richard Horwood as COO, with advice from CVA specialist Antony Batty & Co, the Board was able to put forward a CVA proposal to all the Company's shareholders and creditors. This was approved on 27 March 2025. At this point the Board was able to raise an additional \u00a3300,000 in equity capital to ensure the Company's continued survival.\nPost balance sheet events\nThe CVA and the fundraising enabled the Company's Ordinary Shares to be restored to trading on AIM as a cash shell on 2 April 2025, with the CVA having eliminated approximately \u00a31.4 million in liabilities, leaving the Company substantially debt free and able to seek a new RTO. On the same date, the Company's share subscription for \u00a3300,000 also completed.\nFrom this point we focused not only on seeking and reviewing RTO candidates, but also on raising sufficient additional resources to be able to cover the anticipated costs of such an RTO. With the support of our most longstanding and supportive shareholder, Sanderson Capital Partners Ltd as well as significant new investors, on 18 June 2025 we succeeded in raising a further \u00a3775,000 in new equity, sufficient to cover all our likely RTO and monthly running costs.\nTrading in the Company's shares was then, as expected, suspended on 25 June 2025 due to its being a cash shell that had not completed the acquisition of a trading business within six months of it becoming an AIM Rule 15 cash shell.\nOn 18 July 2025 we announced our agreement in principle, subject (inter alia) to due diligence and approval by the Company's shareholders, to acquire U.S. energy and datacentre company Dunbar through an all-share RTO.\nWith datacentre demand surging and supportive U.S. energy policies, Dunbar is focused on the acquisition, development and monetisation of natural gas and coal mine methane assets for on-site electricity generation and the deployment of mobile compute facilities. Its initial asset portfolio comprises a mix of operated and non-operated interests in producing oil and gas wells, providing a foundation for revenue generation through the planned deployment of mobile compute facilities and modular datacentres, computing power sales, electricity offtake, and verified environmental credits. Dunbar also maintains an active acquisition pipeline targeting additional stranded gas and emissions abatement opportunities across multiple U.S. basins.\nTo execute this strategy, Dunbar has brought together a seasoned team with decades of experience in coal mining and oil and gas, strengthened by leading IT and datacentre professionals.\nOn 13 October 2025, the CVA Supervisor completed the administration of the CVA, and the Company issued the fixed pool of 236,782,175 new Ordinary Shares to its former creditors, representing 8.6 per cent. of the enlarged equity, as approved by its creditors and members in full satisfaction of its pre-CVA liabilities. The outstanding balance of the emergency convertible loans was at the same time automatically converted into 306,665,817 new Ordinary Shares, fully eliminating the rest of the Company's pre-CVA debts.\nConclusion\nDespite the difficult and disappointing year, I am pleased to be able to report that the Company has not only been restored to financial health but has also now been set on a very exciting future path.\nGrahame Cook\nChair\n24 November 2025\nEXTRACTS FROM THE STRATEGIC REPORT\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2025\nThe directors present the strategic report for the year ended 31 March 2025.\nFair review of the business\nA review of the Company's business activities during the year ended 31 March 2025 is set out in the Chair's Statement and Operational Report.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries (the \"\nGroup'\n') incurred a net loss of \u00a34,882,757 in the year ended 31 March 2025 (2024: \u00a31,362,163). At 31 March 2025, the Company held cash at bank totalling \u00a3240,430 (2024: \u00a3137).\nThe acquisition of 3radical and Mymyne has had a major impact on the Company's results for the year. An increase in operational costs following these acquisitions as well as the costs of making these investments which we have impaired in full, have resulted in an increase in the loss for the year from \u00a31.36 million in the year ended 31 March 2024 to \u00a34.88 million in the year to 31 March 2025.\nThese losses include an impairment charge of \u00a32.3 million in respect of goodwill arising from our acquisitions of 3radical and Mymyne, the associated costs of acquisition and admission to AIM of \u00a30.8 million and other operational costs of \u00a31.1 million.\nIn addition to the losses incurred by the Company, the operations of 3radical and Mymyne incurred a loss of \u00a30.7 million in the period after acquisition.\nWhilst the impairment expense was a non-cash cost, reflecting the all-share considerations for the acquisitions of 3radical and Mymyne, the operational activities still consumed \u00a31.6 million of cash during the year. However, we have been able to raise fresh equity through a combination of subscription, placing and the conversion of certain liabilities to new Ordinary Shares. The Company's cash resources stood at approximately \u00a3240,000 at the year-end.\nPost balance sheet events\nRestoration of trading in the Company's Ordinary Shares on AIM took place on 2 April 2025, when 875,000,000 new Ordinary Shares issued at 0.034 pence per Ordinary Share in respect of the \u00a3300,000 equity fundraising were admitted to trading on AIM to complete the share subscription; and a further 68,147,959 new Ordinary Shares were issued on conversion of \u00a310,000 of the total convertible loans of \u00a355,000 at 0.01467 pence per new Ordinary Share.\nOn 18 June 2025, the Company issued a further 968,750,000 new Ordinary Shares, comprising a further equity fundraising of \u00a3775,000 before expenses at 0.08 pence per new Ordinary Share, strengthening its cash position and enabling the Company to cover its anticipated expenses of a new RTO, before its shares were automatically suspended again from trading on 25 June 2025, being six months after the Company was reclassified as an AIM Rule 15 cash shell, pending completion of a new RTO.\nOn 18 July 2025, the Company announced an agreement in principle to acquire U.S. energy company Dunbar Energy Inc. in an all-share RTO, subject (inter alia) to due diligence and approval by the Company's shareholders.\nOn 13 October 2025, pursuant to the CVA approved on 27 March 2025, 236,782,175 new Ordinary Shares ('\nCVA Creditor Shares\n') were allotted on final completion of the CVA to the pre-CVA creditors of the Company in full satisfaction of their debts, along with 306,665,817 new Ordinary Shares in conversion of the remaining \u00a345,000 emergency convertible loans.\nEXTRACTS FROM THE DIRECTORS REPORT\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2025\nThe directors present their annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025.\nThe corporate governance statement set out on pages 26 to 32 of the Company's annual report forms part of this report.\nPrincipal Activities\nThe Company was established in March 2021 as a Special Purpose Acquisition Company to seek acquisition targets in the digital media sector. In January 2022, its Ordinary Shares were admitted to the Standard Segment of the Official List and to trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange.\nIn May 2024, the Company cancelled the listing of its Ordinary Shares on the Standard Segment of the Official List and had its Ordinary Shares admitted to trading on AIM, a market operated by the London Stock Exchange.\nAt the same time, it acquired marketing technology business 3radical Limited ('\n3radical'\n) through an all-share reverse takeover ('\nRTO\n') by issuing 61,184,843 Ordinary Shares at \u00a30.021 per share valuing 3radical at \u00a31,284,882; and issued a further 104,785,670 Ordinary Shares at \u00a30.021 per share raising \u00a32,200,499 before expenses, through a combination of subscription, placing, and the conversion of certain liabilities to new Ordinary Shares.\nAs a result, the Company's principal activity changed to the provision of first-party data solutions for the digital marketing and advertising industry as well as identifying potential companies, businesses, or assets for acquisition.\nIn August 2024, the Company acquired sales & marketing company Mymyne Limited ('\nMymyne'\n) through an all-share acquisition by issuing 9,834,521 Ordinary Shares at \u00a30.0073 per share on completion, plus deferred consideration of up to a maximum of 11,191,665 Ordinary Shares after a year subject to conditions, valuing Mymyne at a maximum of \u00a3153,491 at the closing mid-market price of the Company's Ordinary Shares on 8 August 2024. At the same time, the Company issued a further 9,589,042 Ordinary Shares at \u00a30.0073 per share in satisfaction of \u00a370,000 in fees to professional advisers.\nIn October 2024, the Company issued 13,888,889 Ordinary Shares on conversion of a \u00a3125,000 loan at \u00a30.009 per share.\nThe Company's Ordinary Shares were suspended from trading on AIM on 26 November 2024. On 28 November 2024 3radical, its operating subsidiary, was placed into administration pending a sale of the business. After the unsuccessful marketing of 3radical's business as a going concern and the Company's announcement of 24 December 2024 regarding the CVL of 3radical, the Company was reclassified as a cash shell pursuant to Rule 15 of the AIM Rules, and its principal activity reverted to identifying potential companies, businesses, or assets for acquisition.\nOn 27 March 2025, the Company agreed to issue 875,000,000 Ordinary Shares at \u00a30.00034 per share in a \u00a3300,000 fundraising before expenses and 68,147,959 Ordinary Shares at \u00a30.0001467 per share as conversion of a \u00a310,000 convertible loan, combined with a CVA which eliminated all the Company's pre-CVA debts in a 'debt for equity swap' (other than \u00a345,000 remaining of the convertible loan that was converted into 306,665,817 Ordinary Shares at \u00a30.0001467 per share when the CVA Creditor Shares were issued on 13 October 2025), and enabled the Company to continue operating. At the same time, the nominal value of the Company's Ordinary Shares was reduced from \u00a30.005 per share to \u00a30.0001 per share, with the balance of its nominal share capital reclassified as Deferred Shares of \u00a30.0049 per share.\nGoing Concern\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Board has assessed the Company's financial position as at 31 March 2025 and the factors which may impact the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements. See note 2.4 for key matters assessed by the directors in considering the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for the year to 30 November 2026.\nAs described in Note 19 to the Financial Statements, proposals for the CVA which were conditional upon, inter alia, the approval by Shareholders of certain Resolutions, were duly passed at a General Meeting held on 27 March 2025. The CVA approval was followed on 18 June 2025 by a further fundraising of \u00a30.8 million before expenses to cover the Company's anticipated costs of its next RTO.\nSubsequent to the year-end, on 13 October 2025, the CVA Supervisor completed the administration of the CVA, and the Company issued the fixed pool of 236,782,175 new Ordinary Shares to its former creditors, representing 8.6 per cent. of the enlarged equity as approved by its creditors and members, and 306,665,817 new Ordinary Shares in conversion of the remaining \u00a345,000 convertible loan in full satisfaction of its pre-CVA liabilities.\nManagement and the directors have considered each of these matters and what the Group (Electric Guitar PLC as enlarged by the RTO of Dunbar) is expected to look like following the completion of the anticipated RTO, which includes the Group's working capital requirements over the period to 30 November 2026.\nThe directors have also assessed the Company's ability to continue as a standalone entity in the event no acquisition is pursued and completed in the period to 30 November 2026. Cashflow projections have also been prepared on this basis which support the directors' view that the Company has sufficient facilities to meet its obligations for the period to 30 November 2026 and pay its debts as they fall due. There is, however, no guarantee the directors would be successful in raising additional financing for its future growth and working capital should this be required. This matter indicates that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern at the time of approval of the financial statements.\nThe financial statements do not include adjustments should the going concern basis be inappropriate. Nonetheless, in view of the successful track record of raising financing in the last year from both equity and debt sources and other available funding options, the directors are confident they would be successful in raising any necessary financing within the next 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements.\nFor the reasons, the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.\nQUALIFIED OPINION\nThe Directors draw your attention to the qualified opinion in the independent auditor's report. Relevant amounts reported in the financial statements for 3radical Limited and its subsidiaries (\"3radical\") include a loss from discontinued operations of \u00a32,977,027, net cash used in discontinued operations of \u00a322,172, assets classified as held for sale of \u00a330,943 and liabilities classified as held for sale of \u00a3533,183. As disclosed in notes 2.1, 2.3 and 7 of the financial statements, during the year, 3radical, being wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company were placed into administration and voluntary liquidation. As a result, certain personnel responsible for financial and accounting matters were not available to discuss the financial affairs of 3radical and subsequent to entering liquidation, the accounting records were not adequate to permit the application of appropriate audit procedures. Accordingly, it was not possible to obtain the information necessary to complete audit procedures on 3radical relating to its performance and cash flows for the period ended 31 March 2025 and its financial position at 31 March 2025.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nfor the year ended 31 March 2025\nContinuing operations:\nNote\nYear ended\n31 March 2025\nYear ended\n31 March 2024\n(As restated)\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nAdministrative expenses\n- Acquisition costs\n- Other costs\n4\n4\n(786,490)\n(1,087,210)\n(875,677)\n(447,547\nOperating loss\n(1,873,700)\n(1,323,224)\nFinance costs\n6\n(24,390)\n(46,294)\nFinance income- interest received\n5,279\n7,355\nLoss before income tax\n9\n(1,892,811)\n(1,362,163)\nIncome tax\n10\n-\n-\nLoss for the year from continuing operations\n(1,892,811)\n(1,362,163)\nLoss from discontinued operations,\nnet of income tax\n7\n(2,989,946)\n-\nLoss for the year\n(4,882,757)\n(1,362,163)\nOther comprehensive income:\nItems that may be reclassified to profit or loss\nLoss on translation of foreign operations\n(56,416)\n-\nLoss and other comprehensive income for the year\n(4,939,173)\n(1,362,163)\nBasic and diluted loss per share (pence)\n8\n(0.83)\n(2.35)\nDiscontinued operations\nBasic and diluted loss per share (pence)\n8\n(1.31)\n-\nTotal loss per share\n(2.14)\n(2.35)\n*: The Group's consolidated statement of comprehensive income has been restated in the comparative period as described in Note 2.2.\nThe accompanying notes form part of the financial statements.\nCONSOLIDATED AND COMPANY STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\nfor the year ended 31 March 2025\nGroup\n2025\nCompany\n2025\nGroup and Company\n2024\nNote\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n(As restated)\nASSETS\nNON-CURRENT ASSETS\nProperty, plant and equipment\n2,515\n2,515\n5,529\nCURRENT ASSETS\nReceivables and prepayments\n11\n9,377\n9,377\n75,745\nAssets classified as held for sale\n20\n32,078\n-\n-\nCash and cash equivalents\n12\n240,430\n240,430\n137\n281,885\n249,807\n75,882\nTOTAL ASSETS\n284,400\n252,322\n81,411\nSHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY\nShare capital\n13\n1,285,728\n1,285,728\n289,314\nShare premium\n13\n3,704,387\n3,704,387\n948,629\nForeign currency translation reserve\n15\n(56,416)\n-\n-\nShare-based payment reserve\n15\n63,980\n63,980\n-\nAccumulated losses\n15\n(7,027,997)\n(6,575,763)\n(2,145,240)\nTOTAL EQUITY- (deficiency)\n(2,030,318)\n(1,521,668)\n(907,297)\nCURRENT LIABILITIES\nFinancial liabilities\nBorrowings\n16\n55,000\n55,000\n191,270\nTrade and other payables\n17\n1,404,824\n1,433,990\n797,438\nLiabilities classified as held for sale\n20\n569,894\n-\n-\nShares to be issued\n17\n285,000\n285,000\n-\nTOTAL LIABILITIES\n2,314,718\n1,773,990\n988,708\nTOTAL EQUITY AND LIABILITIES\n284,400\n252,322\n81,411\n*: The Company's statement of financial position has been restated in the comparative period as described in Note 2.2.

General information\nElectric Guitar Plc is a public limited company, registered in England and Wales. The Company's registered office is One Bartholomew Close, London, EC1A 7BL. The Company's principal activities and the nature of its operations are disclosed in the director's report.\nIn May 2024, the Company cancelled the listing of its Ordinary shares on the Standard Segment of the Official List and its Ordinary shares were admitted to trading on AIM, a market operated by the London Stock Exchange. Further to the Company's announcement of 24 December 2024 regarding the liquidation of 3radical, the Company's operating subsidiary, the Company was reclassified as a cash shell pursuant to Rule 15 of the AIM Rules. Restoration of trading in its Ordinary Shares on AIM took place on 2 April 2025, and was suspended again on 25 June 2025 as it had not acquired a new trading company within 6 months of its becoming a cash shell.\nThe functional and presentational currency is Great British Pounds Sterling ('\n\u00a3\n') and the financial statements have been rounded off to nearest \u00a3.\n2. Accounting policies\n2.1 Basis of preparation\nThe financial statements have been prepared under historical cost convention, in accordance with UK adopted International Financial Reporting Standards (UK adopted IFRS) and the Companies Act 2006.\nThe consolidated financial statements for the Company and its subsidiaries ('the\nGroup\n') have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the recognition and measurement requirements of UK adopted International Financial Reporting Standards (UK adopted IFRS). The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis other than going concern. During the year, 3radical Limited, the Company's main subsidiary was put into liquidation. The directors have restructured the operations and debt of the remaining group entities through a CVA which was approved on 27 March 2025. Assets are held at their estimated net realisable value. Liabilities are stated at their expected settlement amount.\nComparatives disclosed in the financial statements, which related to the Company only, were prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the recognition and measurement requirements of UK adopted International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS'), applying a going concern basis of preparation. The comparatives relate to the Company only and are therefore not entirely comparable.\n2. Accounting policies (continued)\n2.1 Basis of preparation (continued)\nThe Company has taken the exemption under s408 Companies Act 2006 and has therefore not published its own statement of comprehensive income for the year ended 31 March 2025. The Company made a loss of \u00a34,430,523 for the year (2024 - loss of \u00a31,362,163).\nThe following accounting principles have been applied:\n2.2 Prior period error\nIn the preparation of the Company's audited financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2024, the statement of financial position overstated borrowings by \u00a360,658 and understated other payables by \u00a355,024.\nThe net impact on results for the year ended 31 March 2024 was to reduce the loss for the year by \u00a35,634 and accumulated losses by the same amount.\nThe Company's statement of comprehensive income incorrectly allocated facility fees on borrowings to operating costs rather than finance costs and overstated losses by \u00a35,634.\nThe Company has corrected these errors in the financial statements by restating the comparatives disclosed in the statement of comprehensive income and statement of financial position as at 31 March 2024.\n2.3 3 radical Limited - liquidation basis of accounting\nAs 3radical has been placed into administration and a CVL, the financial position and results relating to this company and its subsidiary entities at 31 March 2025 have been accounted for on a basis other than going concern in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025. Accordingly, all assets and liabilities relating to these companies have been classified as current, and assets have been written down to their estimated realisable value at 31 March 2025.\n2.4 Going concern\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Board has assessed the Company's financial position as at 31 March 2025 and the factors which may impact the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements.\n2. Accounting policies (continued)\n2.4 Going concern (continued)\nAs at 31 March 2025, the Group had a deficiency in total equity of \u00a32.1 million. The Group also generated a loss for the year ended 31 March 2025 of \u00a34.9 million and a net cash outflow from operating activities of \u00a31.6 million. The deficiency in equity of \u00a32.1 million at 31 March 2025 included current liabilities of \u00a31.4 million which have subsequently been derecognised in April 2025 following proposals for the Company's CVA becoming unconditional. These liabilities therefore no longer existed after April 2025.\nAs at 31 March 2025, liabilities include approximately \u00a3533k classified as held for sale for the 3radical Group. These entities are in liquidation and the Company has no obligation to settle these amounts.\nIn assessing the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern and pay its debts as and when they fall due, the directors have taken into consideration the following matters:\n\u00b7\nAs described in Note 19 to the Financial Statements, proposals for the Company's CVA, which were conditional upon, inter alia, the approval by Shareholders of the Resolutions, were duly passed at a General Meeting held on 27 March 2025.\n\u00b7\nOn 2 April 2025, the Company announced the following pursuant to the CVA Proposals outlined in Note 19 below:\n-\nCompletion of a fundraise by way of Subscription for 875,000,000 new Ordinary Shares in the Company at 0.034p per share for a total of \u00a3300,000; and\n-\nA total of 68,147,959 shares were issued pursuant to the automatic conversion of \u00a310,000 of CLNs in accordance with, inter alia, completion of the Subscription.\n\u00b7\nThe CVA approval was followed on 18 June 2025 by a further fundraising of \u00a30.8 million before expenses to cover the Company's anticipated costs of its next RTO.\nOn 13 October 2025, the CVA was completed with 236,782,175 new Ordinary Shares issued in satisfaction of all the CVA debts, and the outstanding \u00a345,000 of CLNs were converted into 306,665,817 new Ordinary Shares, leaving the Company completely free of all its pre-CVA debts.\nManagement and the directors have considered each of these matters and what the enlarged Group (Electric Guitar PLC as potentially enlarged by the RTO of Dunbar) is expected to look like following the completion of the anticipated RTO, which will only be completed on the basis that the transaction includes sufficient working capital for the enlarged Group's requirements for at least 12 months after completion of the RTO.\nThe directors have also assessed the Company's ability to continue as a standalone entity in the event no acquisition is pursued and completed in the period to 30 November 2026.\n2. Accounting policies (continued)\n2.4 Going concern (continued)\nCashflow projections have also been prepared on this basis which support the directors' view that the Company has sufficient facilities to meet its obligations for the period to 30 November 2026 and pay its debts as they fall due. There is, however, no guarantee the directors would be successful in raising additional financing for its future growth and working capital should this be required. This matter indicates that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern at the time of approval of the financial statements.\nThe key matters assessed by the directors in considering the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for the period to 30 November 2026 are summarised below.\n-\nThe directors have assessed the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern both as a standalone entity (should the anticipated RTO not complete) and in the anticipated scenario where the RTO of Dunbar concludes. The proposed terms of the Dunbar acquisition include a condition requiring Dunbar to have raised sufficient working capital for the enlarged Group for 18 months. There is however no guarantee that the proposed transaction will be completed in accordance with the proposed terms or that the Group, as enlarged by the RTO of Dunbar, will perform in accordance with any projections prepared for the period following completion.\n-\nManagement has prepared detailed cashflow forecasts for the Company on a standalone basis (should the anticipated RTO not proceed to completion) and the management of Dunbar is preparing similar forecasts for the enlarged Group for the 18-month period following completion of the proposed RTO of Dunbar. Before entering into binding contracts to acquire Dunbar, the directors and the Company's nomad will review and approve Dunbar's forecasts, following thorough testing of them by the Company's RTO reporting accountants.\n-\nAs part of its assessment of the forecasts, certain sensitivity analyses will be run on the forecast model for the enlarged Group. In the event the enlarged Group's actual sales for the period ending 12 months after completion of the proposed RTO would be lower than forecast and certain controllable costs were to be deferred, the tests will be required to show that the Group should still have the ability to operate and pay its debts as and when they fall due for the same period as above, but this cannot be guaranteed.\n2. Accounting policies (continued)\n2.4 Going concern (continued)\n-\nIn the event that the proposed RTO does not proceed, and there are no other acquisitions made in the year to 30 November 2026, the Company would continue to be a cash shell. As noted above, the standalone forecasts prepared by the Company show that the Company has sufficient facilities to meet its obligations for the period to 30 November 2026 and pay its debts as they fall due. There is, however, no guarantee the directors would be successful in raising additional financing for its future growth and working capital should this be required.\nThe financial statements do not include adjustments should the going concern basis be inappropriate. Nonetheless, in view of the successful track record of raising financing in the last year from both equity and debt sources and other available funding options, the directors are confident they would be successful in raising any necessary financing within the next 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements.\nFor these reasons, the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.\n2.5 Basis of consolidation\nThe financial statements of the Group consolidate the results of the Company and its subsidiary entities. A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its influence over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases.\nThe consolidated financial statements present the results of the Company and its subsidiaries (the Group) as if they formed a single entity. Intercompany transactions and balances, including unrealised gains/losses between group companies are therefore eliminated in full.\nWhere the Group ceases to control a subsidiary, the subsidiary is deconsolidated from the date which control ceases. The net assets of the subsidiary are included in a disposal calculation along with any consideration received from the disposal, with any gain or loss recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of Electric Guitar plc and its subsidiaries as at 31 March 2025 and for the year then ended using the acquisition method of accounting.\n2.6 Business combinations\nBusiness combinations falling within the scope of IFRS 3 Business Combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group. The Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as the fair value of the consideration transferred less the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\n2.7 Impairment of financial assets\nThe Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (\"ECLs'') for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms.\nFor trade receivables (not subject to provisional pricing) and other receivables due in less than 12 months, the Group applies the simplified approach in calculating ECLs, as permitted by IFRS 9.\nTherefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on the financial asset's lifetime ECL at each reporting date.\nThe Group considers a financial asset in default when contractual payments are 90 days past due.\nHowever, in certain cases, the Group may also consider a financial asset to be in default when internal or external information indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group.\nA financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows and usually occurs when past due for more than one year and not subject to enforcement activity.\nAt each reporting date, the Group assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost are credit impaired. A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.\n2. Accounting policies (continued)\n2.7 Intangible assets - goodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business combination over the Group's interest in the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.\nCost comprises the fair value of assets given, liabilities assumed, and equity instruments issued, plus the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree. Contingent consideration is included in cost at its acquisition date fair value and, in the case of contingent consideration classified as a financial liability, remeasured subsequently through profit or loss.\nGoodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset with any impairment in carrying value being charged to profit or loss. Where the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceed the fair value of consideration paid, the excess is credited in full to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on the acquisition date.\nAll goodwill arising on acquisitions made in the year ended 31 March 2025 was fully impaired as described in Note 18.\n2.7 Impairment of non-financial assets\nImpairment tests on goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful economic lives are undertaken annually at the financial year end. Other non-financial assets are subject to impairment tests whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Where the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell), the asset is written down accordingly.\nWhere it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is carried out on the smallest group of assets to which it belongs for which there are separately identifiable cash flows: its cash generating units ('\nCGUs\n').\nGoodwill is allocated on initial recognition to each of the Group's CGUs that are expected to benefit from a business combination that gives rise to the goodwill.\nImpairment charges are included in profit or loss, except to the extent they reverse gains previously recognised in other comprehensive income. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed.\n2.9 Investment in subsidiaries\nThe Company made two acquisitions in the year ended 31 March 2025, namely 3radical Limited and Mymyne Limited, as described in Note 18.\n2. Accounting policies (continued)\n2.9 Investment in subsidiaries (continued)\nThe directors have reviewed evidence which might suggest whether the investments in the subsidiaries have become impaired. In particular, the directors reviewed whether there exist:\n\u00b7\nsignificant financial difficulty in the subsidiaries;\n\u00b7\na breach of contract, such as a default or past-due event;\n\u00b7\nit is becoming probable that the subsidiaries will enter bankruptcy or another financial reorganisation;\n\u00b7\nthe disappearance of any market for the debt of the subsidiaries because of financial difficulties; or\n\u00b7\nthe financial liabilities of the subsidiaries trade at a deep discount that reflects likely incurred credit losses.\nAs more fully described in Note 18, the directors have considered the evidence in respect of the Company's investments in its subsidiaries and concluded that there were indicators of impairment. The Company has therefore made full impairment against its investments in its newly acquired subsidiaries, amounting to \u00a31,356,674. Receivables due from subsidiaries amounting to \u00a31,192,587 have also been fully impaired in the year.\n2.11 Foreign currency translation\nTransactions in currencies other than the functional and presentation currency of the Company, pound sterling, are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.\nAt each reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are determined in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.\nGains on, or losses arising from, retranslation of the monetary assets and liabilities are included in profit or loss for the period.\n2.12 Taxation\nThe income tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.\n2. Accounting policies (continued)\n2.12 Taxation (continued)\nCurrent tax\nThe tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in profit or loss because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.\nThe Company's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.\nDeferred tax\nDeferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the liability method. Deferred tax assets are only recognised on tax losses when there is convincing evidence that the Company will generate sufficient future taxable profits in the foreseeable future against which the tax losses can be utilised to reduce the Company's liabilities to corporation tax.\n2.13 Cash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank.\n2.14 Share capital and share premium\nShare capital represents the nominal value of shares that have been issued. Share premium includes any premiums received on issue of share capital. Any transactions costs associated with the issuing of shares are deducted from share premium.\n2.15 Provisions for liabilities\nProvisions are made where an event has taken place that gives the Group a legal or constructive obligation that requires settlement by a transfer of economic benefit, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are charged as an expense to the statement of comprehensive income in the year that the Group becomes aware of the obligation and are measured at the best estimate at the balance sheet date of the expenditure required to settle the obligation, taking into account relevant risks and uncertainties. When payments are eventually made, they are charged to the provision carried in the balance sheet.\n2. Accounting policies (continued)\n2.15 Other receivables\nOther receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less loss allowance.\n2.16 Trade and other payables\nTrade and other payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Accruals and accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less.\n2.18 Financial liabilities\nAll financial liabilities are recognised in the statement of financial position when the Group or Company becomes party to the contractual provision of the instrument.\nFinancial liabilities measured at amortised cost\nThe Group's financial liabilities held at amortised cost comprise trade payables and other payables and borrowings.\nThese financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value net of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the instrument.\n2.18 Financial liabilities (continued)\nSuch interest-bearing liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, which ensures that any interest expense over the period to repayment is at a market rate on the balance of the liability carried in the statement of financial position.\nSubsequent measurement\nThe amortised cost of a financial liability is the amount at which the financial liability is measured on initial recognition, minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between the initial amount recognised and the maturity amount.\nSuch amortisation amounts are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. Due to the short-term nature of trade and other payables, they are stated at their nominal value, which approximates their fair value.\n2. Accounting policies (continued)\n2.19 Share based payment arrangements\nThe Company has issued share warrants and options to directors and service providers in respect of services provided.\nThe grant of these instruments is recognised as equity settled share-based payments under IFRS 2. The warrants can be exercised by the holder prior to the exercise date for a fixed number of equity shares at fixed prices.\nThe value of the share-based instruments is determined at the date of grant and expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity based on the Company's estimate of the shares that will eventually vest at the time of the grant. At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimates of the number of instruments that are expected to vest based on service and non-market performance conditions.\nThe Company takes into account the market condition (i.e. target share price being in excess of the exercise price) at the time of estimating the fair value of the instruments. The amount expensed is adjusted over the vesting period for changes in the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest, except for changes resulting from any market-related performance conditions.\n2.20 Capital management\nCapital consists of Ordinary Shares, Deferred Shares, share premium and retained losses. The Board monitors the return on capital. The Company is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.\n2.21 Employee benefits\nThe costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense. The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee's services are received.\n2.22 Adoption of new and revised standards and changes in accounting policies\nA number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 April 2025 and have not been applied in preparing the financial statements. None of these is expected to have a significant effect on the financial statements of the Company. There are no other IFRSs or IFRIC interpretations that are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the Group.\n3. Critical accounting judgements and estimates\nThe preparation of the financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise their judgement in applying the Company's accounting policies.\nEstimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including future conditions that are assessed to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nIn particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amount recognised in the financial statements are described in the following notes:\n- Basis of preparation (Note 2.1)\n- 3radical Limited - liquidation basis of accounting (Note 2.3)\n- Going concern (Note 2.4)\n- Current assets and liabilities held for sale (Note 20)\n- Impairment of goodwill and investments in subsidiaries (Note 18)\n4.

Discontinued operations\nAs more fully described in Note 18, in December 2024, 3radical Limited was placed into a creditors' voluntary liquidation ('\nCVL\n'), which the directors are advised is expected to have been completed in the first half of 2026.\nOn 4 March 2025, the first Gazette Notice was published for the compulsory striking off of Mymyne Limited, with a view to its being dissolved.\nAccordingly, the goodwill asset has been impaired in full at 31 March 2025 and the impairment charge recognised within impairment expense in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The results of 3radical Limited and Mymyne Limited from the period subsequent to their acquisitions have been presented as discontinued operations as follows:\nResults of discontinued activities\nYear ended 31 March 2025\n\u00a3\nYear ended 31 March 2024\n\u00a3\nRevenue\n98,365\n-\nCost of sales\n(58,861)\n-\nGross profit\n39,504\n-\nImpairment of goodwill\n(2,268,891)\nAdministrative expenses\n(725,830)\n-\nOperating loss\n(2,955,217)\n-\nFinance costs\n(34,982)\n-\nFinance income- interest received\n253\n-\nLoss before income tax\n(2,989,946)\n-\nIncome tax\n-\n-\nNet loss for the year from discontinued operations\n(2,989,946)\n-\nCash flows used in discontinued operations\nNet cash used in operation activities\n(772,665)\n-\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(765)\n-\nNet cash from financing activities\n738,339\n-\nNet cash used in discontinued operations\n(35,091)\n-\n7. Discontinued operations (continued)\nThere are no comparatives as this is the first period that 3radical and Mymyne have been consolidated.\n8. Loss per share\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the loss attributable in the period to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the period, excluding any Ordinary Shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares.\nGroup\n31 March\n2025\nGroup\n31 March\n2024\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nLoss for the year attributable to equity holders of the Company:\n- Continuing operations\n(1,892,811)\n(1,362,163)\n- Discontinued operations\n(2,989,496)\n-\nWeighted average number of Ordinary Shares\n228,161,556\n57,862,776\nLoss per share (basic and diluted):\n- Continuing operations\n(0.83)\n(2.35)\n- Discontinued operations\n(1.31)\n-\nLoss per share (pence)\n(2.14)\n(2.35)\nShare warrants and options issued by the Company have an anti-dilutive effect on loss per share. Hence, under IAS requirements diluted loss per share is shown as being the same as basic loss per share.\n9. Loss before income tax\nThe loss before income tax of \u00a31,892,811 (2024: \u00a31,362,163) is stated after charging:\nGroup\n31 March\n2025\nGroup\n31 March\n2024\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nAuditor's remuneration\n- For audit services\n40,000\n29,500\n- Under-provision in respect of prior year\n13,000\n-\n- For non-audit services\n15,000\n16,000\n68,000\n45,500\n10. Income tax\nNo liability to UK corporation tax arose for the year ended 31 March 2025 nor for the year ended 31 March 2024 as the Company generated tax losses for both years.\nPrima facie tax reconciliation\nThe loss for the year was \u00a34,882k (2024: \u00a31,362k). For the year ended 31 March 2025, the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK is 25% (2024: 25%). The rate of corporation tax applicable in UK for profits up to \u00a350k is 19%.\nThe expected tax credit on the loss for the year is \u00a31,221k (2024: \u00a388k). The actual tax credit recognised for the year was \u00a3NIL (2024: \u00a3Nil). The main reasons for the differences for both periods are tax losses not recognised as deferred tax assets due to uncertainty of taxable profits being generated in the foreseeable future.\n11.

These amounts are recognised within current liabilities at 31 March 2025.\n14. Share warrants and options\nA-series warrants and B-series warrants\nThe Company issued A-series warrants and B-series warrants to directors and service providers respectively in previous years.

Business combinations\nAcquisition of 3radical Limited\nOn 3 May 2024, the Company acquired the entire issued share capital of 3radical Limited. At the same time, the Company cancelled its listing on the London Stock Exchange's Standard List, and had its Ordinary Share capital, as enlarged following completion of the transaction at the negotiated value of \u00a31.3 million paid in shares and of a successful \u00a32.2 million equity fundraising, admitted to trading on the AIM Market of the London Stock Exchange. At the time of the acquisition, 3radical was a business with a well-established software platform already in use by major clients around the world, which helped marketers engage their customers by securing the first-party data marketers increasingly need.\nThe all-share consideration of \u00a31,284,882 was settled by the issue of 61,184,843 Ordinary Shares in the Company on completion.\nThe carrying values of 3radical's assets and liabilities on acquisition were assessed as being in line with their fair values. No fair value adjustments were assessed as necessary by the directors.\n18. Business combinations (continued)\nGoodwill was recognised on this acquisition because the cost of the combination included a control premium. Details of the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, purchase consideration and goodwill are as follows:\n\u00a3\nCash at bank\n34,960\nTrade and other receivables\n38,328\nTrade and other payables\n(645,422)\nBorrowings\n(347,393)\nNet liabilities at acquisition\n(919,527)\nPurchase consideration- satisfied through new ordinary shares issued\n1,284,882\nGoodwill on acquisition\n2,204,409\nIn December 2024, 3radical was placed into a creditors' voluntary liquidation ('\nCVL\n''). Accordingly, the goodwill asset has been impaired in full at 31 March 2025 and the impairment charge recognised within impairment expense in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\nThe liquidation is currently in progress with the value of asset realisations to be confirmed on completion, which the directors are advised is expected in the first half of 2026.\nThe Directors have considered the evidence in respect of the Company's investments in 3radical and concluded that there were indicators of impairment. The Company has therefore made full impairment against its investments in 3radical, amounting to \u00a31,284,882.\nReceivables due from 3radical amounting to \u00a31,192,587 have also been fully impaired in the year.\nAcquisition of Mymyne Limited\nOn 28 August 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Mymyne, a developer of data-related software solutions, and the provider of related sales & marketing services to 3radical, achieving significant cost-savings. The initial all-share consideration of \u00a371,792 was settled by the issue of 9,834,521 Ordinary Shares in the Company on completion.\nAdditional deferred consideration of approximately \u00a382,000 at the completion share price was payable in shares depending inter alia on the financial performance of Mymyne.\n18. Business combinations (continued)\nThe Company recognised the initial consideration of \u00a371,792 as the purchase price, but not the conditional deferred consideration of up to a further 11,191,665 shares (worth up to a maximum of \u00a382k at the completion share price, and capped at a total of \u00a3268.6k at the mid-market price of the Company's shares if and when payable) as the likelihood of the conditional deferred amount being paid was uncertain.\nJohn Regan, who served as Electric Guitar's CEO, and John Hutchinson, who served as Electric Guitar's Chair, and both being directors of the Company, were 36.9% and 9.5% shareholders of Mymyne respectively at the time of the acquisition and therefore the acquisition was considered to be a related party transaction.\nThe carrying values of Mymyne's assets and liabilities on acquisition were assessed as being in line with their fair values. No fair value adjustments were assessed as necessary by the directors. Goodwill was recognised on this acquisition because the cost of the combination included a control premium. Details of the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, purchase consideration and goodwill are as follows:\n\u00a3\nCash at bank\n18,629\nTrade and other receivables\n20,000\nTrade and other payables\n(3,243)\nBorrowings\n(28,076)\nNet assets at acquisition\n7,310\nPurchase consideration- satisfied through new ordinary shares issued\n71,792\nGoodwill on acquisition\n64,483\nOn 4 March 2025, the first Gazette Notice was published for the compulsory striking off of Mymyne Ltd, with a view to its being dissolved. Accordingly, the goodwill asset has been impaired in full at 31 March 2025 and the impairment charge recognised within impairment expense in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\nThe directors have considered the evidence in respect of the Company's investments in Mymyne and concluded that there were indicators of impairment. The Company has therefore made full impairment against its investments in Mymyne, amounting to \u00a371,792.\n18. Business combinations (continued)\nThe total impairment charge in respect of 3radical and Mymyne recognised in respect of goodwill arising in the year ended 31 March 2024 was \u00a32,268,891 which is included in the statement of comprehensive income.\nFollowing the above business combinations being completed, the Company's subsidiaries as at 31 March 2025 were as follows:\nShareholding\nNature of Business\nCountry of\nIncorporation\nHeld directly:\nMymyne Limited\n100%\nSoftware developer\nEngland and Wales\n3radical Limited\n100%\nSoftware developer (in liquidation)\nEngland and Wales\nHeld indirectly:\n3radical Pte Limited\n100%\nSoftware developer\nSingapore\n3radical Pty Limited\n100%\nSoftware developer\nAustralia\n3radical Inc\n100%\nSoftware developer\nUSA\n19. Company Voluntary Arrangement (\"CVA\"), Subscription for Ordinary Shares, and Share Capital Reorganisation\nFurther to the Company's announcement of 24 December 2024 regarding the liquidation of 3radical, the Company's operating subsidiary, and subsequent reclassification of the Company as a cash shell pursuant to Rule 15 of the AIM Rules, the Board presented the following proposals to Shareholders:\n- a fundraise by way of subscription for 875,000,000 new Ordinary Shares in the Company and a CLN for 374,813,776 new Ordinary Shares raising total funds of \u00a3355,000;\n- the proposed CVA in order to allow the Company to restructure itself in a way that allows shareholders and creditors to retain an economic interest in the Company; and\n- the proposed share capital reorganisation to amend the nominal value of the Company's Ordinary Shares to 0.01 pence each to allow the CVA and fundraising to complete in accordance with their terms.\nFollowing below expected trading performance of 3radical since the RTO and the failure of the Company to secure additional funds to continue to fund the losses of 3radical, 3radical was placed into liquidation on 24 December 2024. As at the date of the proposals, the Company had debts of \u00a31,399,799 and cash of \u00a34,765. As such, the Company was left in a position whereby its only remaining viable options were to either liquidate the Company or to seek some form of creditor protection.\n19. Company Voluntary Arrangement (\"CVA\"), Subscription for Ordinary Shares, and Share Capital Reorganisation (continued\nThe Board therefore concluded that a CVA, if approved, would allow for the Company to continue as an entity for the benefit of all stakeholders and to seek to retain admission of the Ordinary Shares to trading on AIM with a new Company strategy to pursue acquisitions.\nThe net proceeds of the fundraising were to be used principally to allow the Company to implement the CVA and provide working capital to allow it to pursue an acquisition or investment constituting a reverse takeover pursuant to Rule 14 of the AIM Rules.\nThe Proposals which were conditional upon, inter alia, the approval by shareholders of the Resolutions, were duly passed at a General Meeting held on 27 March 2025.\n20. Current assets and liabilities held for sale\n3radical Limited and its subsidiaries and Mymyne Limited are presented as a disposal group held for sale following the appointment of the liquidators for 3radical and the striking off notice for Mymyne.\nThe expected settlement of the disposal group is not known at the date of the annual report.\nAssets classified as held for sale\n:\n\u00a3\nPlant and equipment\n640\nCash at bank\n18,499\nTrade and other receivables\n12,939\nTotal\n32,078\nLiabilities classified as held for sale\n:\n\u00a3\nTrade and other payables\n542,492\nBorrowings\n27,402\nTotal\n569,894\nAn Impairment loss of \u00a32,268,891 in relation to goodwill has been recognised in expenses in the consolidated income statement.\n21. Financial risk management\nThe Group's activities expose it to liquidity risk, credit risk and foreign exchange risk. The Company's overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group's financial performance.\n21. Financial risk management (continued)\nCapital risk management\nThe Group manages its capital to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of debt and equity instruments.\nThe capital structure of the Group consists of debt, cash and cash equivalents and equity comprising share capital and reserves. The Company reviews the capital structure annually and as part of this review considers the cost of capital and risks associated with each class of capital and debt.\nLiquidity risk\nResponsibility for management of liquidity risk rests with the board of directors, which has established an appropriate liquidity risk framework for the management of the Company's funding and liquidity requirements. The Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, debt facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecasts and actual cash flows, and by matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.\nForeign exchange risk\nThe Company makes some purchases in foreign currencies. The payments in foreign currency are made using the exchange rates on the date of payment. As of year-end, the Company did not have any payables in foreign currency.\n22. Related party transactions\nDuring the year, the Company entered into the following transactions with related parties, all of which were conducted on an arm's length basis:\n\u00b7\nSalary and bonuses totalling \u00a367,500 payable to John Hutchinson, a director of the Company at the time, were settled by the issue of 3,214,280 shares at 0.21p a share on 3 May 2024.\n\u00b7\nSalary and bonuses totalling \u00a330,264 payable to Richard Horwood, a director of the Company, were settled by the issue of 1,441,140 shares at 0.21p a share on 3 May 2024.\n22. Related party transactions (continued)\n\u00b7\nFacility loans totalling \u00a3535,000 due and payable to Sanderson Capital Partners Limited, were settled by the issue of 25,476,190 shares at 0.21p a share on 3 May 2024.\n\u00b7\nOn 9 August 2024, 9,589,042 shares were issued to certain professional advisors and consultants to settle their fees. Included in this amount was 5,479,452 shares issued to Tanvier Malik in relation to his role as Capital Markets Consultant for a total of \u00a340,000. Since Mr Malik controls Sanderson Capital Partners Limited, this transaction constitutes a related party transaction.\n\u00b7\nLoans totalling \u00a3125,000 made by Sanderson Capital Partners Limited were advanced during the year and settled by the issue of 13,888,888 shares at 0.9p a share on 14 October 2024 which constitutes a related party transaction.\n\u00b7\nOn 28 August 2024, the Company completed an all-share acquisition of Mymyne, valuing it at up to a maximum of approximately \u00a3154k based on the closing mid-market price of the Company's shares immediately prior to announcing the proposed acquisition on 9 August 2024, which was approved by shareholders in General Meeting on 27 August 2024.\u00a0The Company recognised the initial consideration of \u00a372k (settled by the issue of 9,834,521 shares in the Company - see Note 18) as the purchase price, but not the conditional deferred consideration of up to a further 11,191,665 shares (worth up to a maximum of \u00a382k at the completion share price, and capped at a total of \u00a3268.6k at the mid-market price of the Company's shares if and when payable) as the likelihood of the conditional deferred amount being paid was uncertain. John Regan, who served as Electric Guitar's CEO, and John Hutchinson, who served as Electric Guitar's Chair, and both being directors of the Company, were 31.2% (including John Regan's associate) and 9.2% shareholders of Mymyne respectively at the time of the acquisition, receiving 3,068,140 and 908,059 respectively and valued at 0.73p per share on completion, and therefore it was a related party transaction.\nThe fair value of net assets acquired on Mymyne's books was \u00a38k, including cash at bank of \u00a318k. Goodwill arising on acquisition was \u00a364k. This goodwill has been written off in full through the income statement.\n\u00b7\nThe Company purchased services of \u00a3275,000 (2024: \u00a3206,750) from BDB Pitmans LLP.

Sarfraz Munshi was a director of the Company during the financial year 2025 and also director of Belmont Partners.\n\u00b7\nThe Company purchased services of \u00a395,000 (2024: \u00a395,000) from Mymyne Ltd prior to its acquisition. Of this amount, \u00a340k was for the provision of commercial due diligence services in connection with the proposed acquisition of a previous target which did not proceed. The remaining \u00a355k was for the provision of commercial due diligence services in connection with the 3radical RTO. John Regan, who served as Electric Guitar's CEO, and John Hutchinson, who served as Electric Guitar's Chair, and both being directors of the Company, were 31.2% and 9.2% shareholders of Mymyne Ltd respectively at the time the services were purchased. The amount payable as at year-end was Nil (2024: Nil). John Regan was a director of the Company and is also director of Mymyne Ltd.\n\u00b7\nOn 26 February 2025, the Company received \u00a345,000 from Sanderson, a substantial shareholder of the Company, and \u00a310,000 from Grahame Cook, a Non-Executive Director of the Company.
