Dunbar's business is focused on the provision of so-called 'behind the meter' on-site electricity generation, and the deployment of modular compute facilities, to provide a diverse range of energy and infrastructure solutions for the high-performance computing industry. Modular compute facilities are data centres built from pre-engineered, factory-made components that can be quickly deployed, scaled and relocated, offering greater agility, cost-efficiency and adaptability for modern IT needs like AI.\nAlthough demand for datacentres and compute sites continues to grow rapidly, not least due to the rapid development of AI, it is hampered by the greatly increased demand for the large amounts of electricity they consume. Dunbar addresses this by establishing its sites close to gas wells it will control that are able to produce gas that is typically too remote from the main gas pipeline networks to be cost-effectively monetised.\nSuch gas can be efficiently converted into electricity on-site, reducing the need for the compute facilities to have to draw power from an increasingly overstretched electricity supply grid - hence the expression 'behind-the-meter'.\nPost balance sheet events\nAfter our CVA Supervisor settled claims from preferential creditors such as HMRC, the CVA was finally completed on 8 October 2025, with 'debt for equity' shares issued in exchange for the \u00a31.4m liabilities and the remaining \u00a345k of convertible loans, leaving the Company debt free.\nDetailed discussions have continued since reaching the agreement in principle to acquire Dunbar, reflecting on-going developments in Dunbar's business opportunities and asset acquisitions.\nFinalising these discussions has delayed the due diligence process and therefore the signing of definitive legal agreements. However, we expect the proposed RTO to be put to shareholders for approval in the first quarter of 2026.\nWe look forward to updating shareholders in due course.\nGrahame Cook\nChair\n31 December 2025\nDIRECTORS REPORT\nFinancial review\nThe results for the period are set out on page 10. For the six months ended 30 September 2025, the Company reports a net profit of \u00a3900k (2024: net loss of \u00a34,268k) for the Company and its subsidiaries ('\nGroup\n').\nDuring the six months ended 30 September 2025, the Company incurred one-off expenses in respect of the proposal to acquire US energy company Dunbar Energy Inc. in an all-share RTO, subject (inter alia) to due diligence and approval by the Company's shareholders.\nCurrent liabilities of \u00a31.4m included in the Company's and Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at 31 March 2025 were derecognised in April 2025 following proposals for the Company's CVA becoming unconditional. These liabilities therefore no longer existed after April 2025 and the derecognition of these has been credited to the Income Statement.\nDuring the period, the Group incurred a net cash inflow of \u00a3297k (2024: outflow of \u00a330k). At 30 September 2025, the Company held cash at bank of \u00a3537k.\nNo dividends were paid. The directors do not recommend payment of an interim dividend.\nBasis of preparation\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. See note 2.3 for key matters assessed by the Directors in determining that the half-year financial statements should be prepared on a going concern basis.\nRichard Horwood\nDirector\n31 December 2025\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2025\nNote\nSix months ended\n30/9/25\nSix months ended 30/9/24\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nContinuing operations\nOther income:\n- Derecognition of liabilities\n4\n1,351\n-\nAdministration expenses:\n- Acquisition costs\n- Other costs\n6\n(259)\n(193)\n(585)\n-\nOperating profit / (loss)\n899\n(585)\nFinance costs\n(1)\n(5)\nFinance income- interest received\n2\n3\nProfit / (loss) before income tax\n900\n(587)\nIncome tax\n-\n-\nProfit / (loss) for the period from continuing operations\n900\n(587)\nLoss from discontinued operations\n7\n-\n(3,681)\nProfit / (loss) for the period\nOther comprehensive income:\n900\n(4,268)\nItems that may be reclassified to profit or loss\nGains on translation of foreign operations\n-\n28\nProfit / (loss) and other comprehensive income for the period\n900\n(4,240)\nEarnings (loss) per share:\nBasic (pence) - continuing operations\n8\n0.05\n-\nBasic (pence) - discontinued operations\n-\n(2.13)\nDiluted (pence)\n0.04\n(2.13)\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\nAs at 30 September 2025\nAt\n30 Sept 2025\nAt\n31 March 2025\nNote\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n(unaudited)\n(audited)\nNON-CURRENT ASSETS\nProperty, plant and equipment\n2\n3\nCURRENT ASSETS\nReceivables and prepayments\n130\n9\nAssets classified as held for sale\n12\n32\n32\nCash and cash equivalents\n537\n240\n699\n281\nTOTAL ASSETS\n701\n284\nSHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY\nShare capital\n9\n1,481\n1,286\nShare premium\nForeign currency translation reserve\n9\n4,585\n(56)\n3,704\n(56)\nShare-based payment reserve\n9\n84\n64\nAccumulated losses\n(6,128)\n(7,028)\nTOTAL EQUITY- (deficiency)\n(34)\n(2,030)\nCURRENT LIABILITIES\nBorrowings\n10\n45\n55\nTrade and other payables\n11\n85\n1,404\nLiabilities classified as held for sale\n12\n570\n570\nShares to be issued\n35\n285\nTOTAL LIABILITIES\n735\n2,314\nTOTAL EQUITY AND LIABILITIES\n701\n284\nThese financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors and authorised for issue on 31 December 2025 and were signed on its behalf by:\nRichard Horwood, Director\nCompany number 13288812\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2025\nShare capital\nShare premium\nRetained losses\nShare-based payment reserve\nForeign currency trans-lation reserve\nTotals\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nAt 1 April 2025\n1,286\n3,704\n(7,028)\n64\n(56)\n(2,030)\nChanges in equity\nNew shares issued during the period\n195\n920\n-\n-\n-\n1,115\nCosts of share issues\n-\n(39)\n-\n-\n-\n(39)\nShare based payments\n-\n-\n-\n20\n-\n20\nProfit for the period\n-\n-\n900\n-\n-\n900\nAt 30 September 2025\n(unaudited)\n1,481\n4,585\n(6,128)\n84\n(56)\n(34)\nAt 1 April 2024\n(audited)\n289\n949\n(2,146)\n-\n-\n(908)\nChange in equity\nNew shares issued during the period\n927\n2,700\n-\n-\n-\n3,627\nShare based payments\n-\n-\n-\n49\n-\n49\nForeign exchange translation gains\n-\n-\n-\n-\n28\n28\nLoss for the period\n-\n-\n(4,268)\n-\n-\n(4,268)\nAt 30 September 2024\n(unaudited)\n1,216\n3,649\n(6,414)\n49\n28\n(1,472)\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2025\n6 months\nended\n30 Sept\n2025\n6 months\nended\n30 Sept\n2024\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nCash flow from operating activities\n(unaudited)\n(unaudited)\nProfit / (loss) for the period\n900\n(4,268)\nAdjustments for:\nDerecognition of CVA liabilities\n(1,351)\n-\nFinance costs\n-\n5\nFinance income\n(2)\n(3)\nShare-based payment charges\n20\n49\nDepreciation charges\n-\n1\nImpairment of goodwill\n-\n2,269\nForeign currency differences\n-\n(28)\n(Increase) / decrease in other receivables\n(117)\n74\nIncrease in trade and other payables\n94\n535\nNet cash used in operating activities\n(456)\n(1,366)\nCash flow from investing activities\nFinance income\n2\n3\nNet cash from investing activities\n2\n3\nCash flow from financing activities\nProceeds from issue of shares\n751\n1,323\nNet proceeds from borrowings\n-\n10\nNet cash from financing activities\n751\n1,333\nNet increase / (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n297\n(30)\nCash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period\n240\n-\nCash acquired on acquisition of subsidiaries\n-\n53\nCash and cash equivalents at the end of the period\n537\n23\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2025\n1. General information\nElectric Guitar Plc is a public limited company, registered in England and Wales. The Company's registered office is One Bartholomew Close, London, EC1A 7BL.\nIn May 2024, the Company cancelled the listing of its Ordinary shares on the Standard Segment of the Official List and its Ordinary shares were admitted to trading on AIM, a market operated by the London Stock Exchange. Further to the Company's announcement of 24 December 2024 regarding the liquidation of 3radical, the Company's operating subsidiary, the Company was reclassified as a cash shell pursuant to Rule 15 of the AIM Rules. Restoration of trading in its Ordinary shares on AIM took place on 2 April 2025, and was suspended again on 25 June 2025 as it had not acquired a new trading company within 6 months of its becoming a cash shell.\nFollowing approval of the Company's CVA on 27 March 2025 and the Company's main subsidiary 3radical being put into liquidation, the principal activity of the Company during the period to 30 September 2025 was that of identifying potential companies, businesses, or assets for acquisition. The 3radical liquidation is currently in progress with the value of asset realisations to be confirmed on completion, which the directors are advised is expected in the first half of 2026.\nThe functional and presentational currency is Great British Pounds Sterling ('\n\u00a3\n') and the financial statements have been rounded to nearest thousands of pounds (\u00a3'000).\n2. Significant accounting policies\nThe following significant accounting policies have been applied:\n2.1 Basis of preparation\nThese half-year financial statements for the Company and its subsidiaries ('the\nGroup\n') have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the recognition and measurement requirements of UK adopted International Financial Reporting Standards (UK adopted IFRS).\nIn December 2024, 3radical, the Company's main subsidiary was put into liquidation. The directors also restructured the operations and debt of the Company through a CVA in March 2025 which was formally completed in October 2025. Assets are held at their net realisable value. Liabilities are stated at their expected settlement amount.\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2025 (continued)\n2. Accounting policies (continued)\n2.2 3 radical Limited - liquidation basis of accounting\nAs 3radical has been placed into administration and a creditors' voluntary liquidation ('\nCVL\n'), the financial position and results relating to this company and its subsidiary entities at 30 September 2025 have been accounted for on a basis other than going concern in the condensed consolidated financial statements for the period ended 30 September 2025. Accordingly, all assets and liabilities relating to these companies have been classified as current, and assets have been written down to their estimated realisable value at 30 September 2025.\n2.3 Going Concern\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Board has assessed the Company's financial position as at 30 September 2025 and the factors which may impact the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements.\nAs at 30 September 2025, the Group had a deficiency in total equity of \u00a334,000. Excluding other income from the derecognition of liabilities arising from the CVA, the Group generated a loss for the period ended 30 September 2025 of \u00a3451,000 and a net cash outflow from operating activities of \u00a3456,000. The deficiency in equity of \u00a334,000 at 30 September 2025 was after current liabilities of \u00a31.4 million were derecognised in April 2025 following proposals for the Company's CVA becoming unconditional. These liabilities therefore no longer existed after April 2025.\nAs at 30 September 2025, liabilities include approximately \u00a3533k classified as held for sale for the 3radical Group. These entities are in liquidation and the Company has no obligation to settle these amounts.\nIn assessing the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern and pay its debts as and when they fall due, the directors have taken into consideration the following matters:\nOn 13 October 2025, the CVA was completed with 236,782,175 new Ordinary shares issued in satisfaction of all the CVA debts, and the outstanding \u00a345,000 of CLNs were converted into 306,665,817 new Ordinary shares, leaving the Company completely free of all its pre-CVA debts.\nManagement and the directors have considered each of these matters and what the enlarged Group (Electric Guitar PLC as potentially enlarged by the RTO of Dunbar) is expected to look like following the completion of the anticipated RTO, which will only be completed on the basis that the transaction includes sufficient working capital for the enlarged Group's requirements for at least 12 months after completion of the RTO.\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2025 (continued)\n2. Accounting policies (continued)\nThe directors have also assessed the Company's ability to continue as a standalone entity in the event no acquisition is pursued and completed in the period to December 2026.\nCashflow projections have also been prepared on this basis which support the directors' view that the Company has sufficient facilities to meet its obligations for the period to 31 December 2026 and pay its debts as they fall due. There is, however, no guarantee the directors would be successful in raising additional financing for its future growth and working capital should this be required. This matter indicates that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern at the time of approval of the condensed financial statements.\nThe key matters assessed by the directors in considering the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for the period to 31 December 2026 are summarised below.\n-\nThe directors have assessed the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern both as a standalone entity (should the anticipated RTO not complete) and in the anticipated scenario where the RTO of Dunbar concludes. The proposed terms of the Dunbar acquisition include a condition requiring Dunbar to have raised sufficient working capital for the enlarged Group for 18 months. There is however no guarantee that the proposed transaction will be completed in accordance with the proposed terms or that the Group, as enlarged by the RTO of Dunbar, will perform in accordance with any projections prepared for the period following completion.\n-\nManagement has prepared detailed cashflow forecasts for the Company on a standalone basis (should the anticipated RTO not proceed to completion) and the management of Dunbar is preparing similar forecasts for the enlarged Group for the 18-month period following completion of the proposed RTO of Dunbar. Before entering into binding contracts to acquire Dunbar, the directors will review and approve Dunbar's forecasts, following thorough testing of them by the Company's RTO reporting accountants.\n-\nAs part of its assessment of the forecasts, certain sensitivity analyses will be run on the forecast model for the enlarged Group. In the event the enlarged Group's actual sales for the period ending 12 months after completion of the proposed RTO would be lower than forecast and certain controllable costs were to be deferred, the tests will be required to show that the Group should still have the ability to operate and pay its debts as and when they fall due for the same period as above, but this cannot be guaranteed.\n-\nIn the event that the proposed RTO does not proceed, and no other acquisitions are pursued in the year to 31 December 2026, the Company would continue to be a cash shell. As noted above, the standalone forecasts prepared by the Company show that the Company has sufficient facilities to meet its obligations for the period to 31 December 2026 and pay its debts as they fall due.\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2025 (continued)\n2. Accounting policies (continued)\n-\nThere is, however, no guarantee the directors would be successful in raising additional financing for its future growth and working capital should this be required.\nThe financial statements do not include adjustments should the going concern basis be inappropriate. Nonetheless, in view of the successful track record of raising financing in the last year from both equity and debt sources and other available funding options, the directors are confident they would be successful in raising any necessary financing within the next 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements.\nFor these reasons, the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.\n2.4 Basis of consolidation\nThe financial statements of the Group consolidate the results of the Company and its subsidiary entities. A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its influence over the entity.\nThe financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the condensed consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases.\nThe consolidated financial statements present the results of the Company and its subsidiaries (the Group) as if they formed a single entity. Intercompany transactions and balances, including unrealised gains/losses between group companies are therefore eliminated in full.\nWhere the Group ceases to control a subsidiary, the subsidiary is deconsolidated from the date which control ceases. The net assets of the subsidiary are included in a disposal calculation along with any consideration received from the disposal, with any gain or loss recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n2.5 Cash and cash equivalent\ns\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank.\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2025 (continued)\n2. Accounting policies (continued)\n2.6 Share capital and share premium\nShare capital represents the nominal value of shares that have been issued. Share premium includes any premiums received on issue of share capital. Any transactions costs associated with the issuing of shares are deducted from share premium.\n2.7 Provisions for liabilities\nProvisions are made where an event has taken place that gives the group a legal or constructive obligation that requires settlement by a transfer of economic benefit, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\nProvisions are charged as an expense to the income statement in the period that the group becomes aware of the obligation and are measured at the best estimate at the reporting date of the expenditure required to settle the obligation, after taking into account relevant risks and uncertainties. When payments are eventually made, they are charged to the provision carried in the balance sheet.\n2.8 Trade and other payables\nTrade and other payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Accruals and accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n2.9 Financial liabilities\nAll financial liabilities are recognised in the condensed consolidated statement of financial position when the Company or its subsidiaries becomes party to the contractual provision of a financial instrument.\nFinancial liabilities measured at amortised cost\nFinancial liabilities held at amortised cost comprise trade payables and other payables and borrowings.\nThese financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value net of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the instrument. Such interest-bearing liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, which ensures that any interest expense over the period to repayment is at a market rate on the balance of the liability carried in the condensed consolidated statement of financial position.\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2025 (continued)\n2. Accounting policies (continued)\n2.9 Financial liabilities (continued)\nSubsequent measurement\nThe amortised cost of a financial liability is the amount at which the financial liability is measured on initial recognition, minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using effective interest method of any difference between the initial amount recognised and the maturity amount. Such amortisation amounts are recognised in the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Due to the short-term nature of trade and other payables, they are stated at their nominal value, which approximates their fair value.\n2.10 Employee benefits\nThe costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense. The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee's services are received.\n2.11 Business combinations\nThe condensed consolidated half-year financial statements incorporate the results of Electric Guitar plc and its subsidiaries as at 30 September 2025 and for the six months period then ended using the acquisition method of accounting.\nBusiness combinations falling within the scope of IFRS 3 Business Combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the group.\nThe Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as the fair value of the consideration transferred less the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nCosts relating to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of equity instruments, are expensed as incurred.\n3. Critical accounting judgements and estimates\nThe preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with UK adopted IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise their judgment in applying the Company's accounting policies.\nEstimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including future conditions that are assessed to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2025 (continued)\n3. Critical accounting judgements and estimates (continued)\nCritical accounting judgements applied by the directors in preparing these half-year financial statements are disclosed in the basis of preparation (Note 2.1), basis other than going concern (Note 2.3) accounting policies and the derecognition of liabilities described in Note 4 .\n4.\nOther income\n6 months ended\n30 Sept 2025\n6 months ended\n30 Sept 2024\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nDerecognition of liabilities\n1,351\n-\n1,351\n-\nCurrent liabilities of \u00a31.4m included in the Company's and Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at 31 March 2025 have been derecognised in April 2025 following proposals for the Company's CVA becoming unconditional. These liabilities therefore no longer existed after April 2025.\nThe CVA Supervisor completed the administration of the CVA, and the Company issued the fixed pool of 236,782,175 new Ordinary shares to its former creditors, representing 8.6 per cent. of the enlarged equity, as approved by its creditors and members in full satisfaction of its pre-CVA liabilities. The outstanding balance of the emergency convertible loans was at the same time automatically converted into 306,665,817 new Ordinary shares, fully eliminating the rest of the Company's pre-CVA debts.\n5.\nEmployees and directors' remuneration\n6 months ended\n30 Sept 2025\n6 months ended\n30 Sept 2024\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nWages and salaries\n48\n587\nSocial security costs\n-\n64\nOther pension costs\n-\n6\n48\n657\n6.\nAcquisition costs\nDuring the six months ended 30 September 2025, the Company incurred one-off expenses in respect of the proposal to acquire U.S. energy company Dunbar Energy Inc. in an all-share RTO, subject (inter alia) to due diligence and approval by the Company's shareholders.\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2025 (continued)\nIn the comparative six month period to 30 September 2024, the Company incurred costs in connection with the acquisition of subsidiaries and admission to AIM.\n6 months ended\n30 Sept 2025\n6 months ended\n30 Sept 2024\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nProfessional fees - purchase of subsidiaries\n-\n520\nListing fees\n-\n15\nOther professional fees\n259\n50\n259\n585\n7.\nDiscontinued operations\nResults of discontinued activities\n6\nmonths\nended\n30 Sept\n2025\n6 months\nended\n30 Sept 2024\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nRevenue\n-\n57\nCost of sales\n-\n(34)\nGross profit\n-\n23\nImpairment of goodwill\n-\n(2,269)\nAdministrative expenses\n-\n(1,433)\nOperating loss\n-\n(3,679)\nFinance costs\n-\n(2)\nLoss before income tax\n-\n-\nIncome tax\n-\n-\nNet loss for the year from discontinued operations\n-\n(3,681)\nCash flows used in discontinued operations\nNet cash used in operating activities\n-\n(772)\nNet cash used in investing activities\n-\n-\nNet cash from financing activities\n-\n738\nNet cash used in discontinued operations\n(34)\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2025 (continued)\n8.\nEarnings / (loss) per share\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit/ (loss) attributable in the period to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of Ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding any Ordinary shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares.\n6 months\nended\n30 Sept\n2025\n6 months\nended\n30 Sept\n2024\nProfit / (loss) for the period attributable to equity holders of the Company (\u00a3'000):\n-\nContinuing activities\n900\n-\n-\nDiscontinued activities\n-\n(4,268)\nWeighted average number of Ordinary shares (basic)\n1,771,471,843\n200,322,398\nWeighted average number of Ordinary shares (diluted)\n2,105,960,653\n200,322,398\nBasic earnings / (loss) per share (pence):\n-\nContinuing activities\n0.05\n-\n-\nDiscontinued activities\n-\n(2.13)\n0.05\n(2.13)\nDiluted earnings / (loss) per share (pence):\n-\nContinuing activities\n0.04\n-\n-\nDiscontinued activities\n-\n(2.13)\n0.04\n(2.13)\nFor the comparative period, share warrants issued by the Company have an anti-dilutive effect on loss per share.

Dunbar's business is focused on the provision of so-called 'behind the meter' on-site electricity generation, and the deployment of modular compute facilities, to provide a diverse range of energy and infrastructure solutions for the high-performance computing industry. Modular compute facilities are data centres built from pre-engineered, factory-made components that can be quickly deployed, scaled and relocated, offering greater agility, cost-efficiency and adaptability for modern IT needs like AI.\nAlthough demand for datacentres and compute sites continues to grow rapidly, not least due to the rapid development of AI, it is hampered by the greatly increased demand for the large amounts of electricity they consume. Dunbar addresses this by establishing its sites close to gas wells it will control that are able to produce gas that is typically too remote from the main gas pipeline networks to be cost-effectively monetised.\nSuch gas can be efficiently converted into electricity on-site, reducing the need for the compute facilities to have to draw power from an increasingly overstretched electricity supply grid - hence the expression 'behind-the-meter'.\nPost balance sheet events\nAfter our CVA Supervisor settled claims from preferential creditors such as HMRC, the CVA was finally completed on 8 October 2025, with 'debt for equity' shares issued in exchange for the \u00a31.4m liabilities and the remaining \u00a345k of convertible loans, leaving the Company debt free.\nDetailed discussions have continued since reaching the agreement in principle to acquire Dunbar, reflecting on-going developments in Dunbar's business opportunities and asset acquisitions.\nFinalising these discussions has delayed the due diligence process and therefore the signing of definitive legal agreements. However, we expect the proposed RTO to be put to shareholders for approval in the first quarter of 2026.\nWe look forward to updating shareholders in due course.\nGrahame Cook\nChair\n31 December 2025\nDIRECTORS REPORT\nFinancial review\nThe results for the period are set out on page 10. For the six months ended 30 September 2025, the Company reports a net profit of \u00a3900k (2024: net loss of \u00a34,268k) for the Company and its subsidiaries ('\nGroup\n').\nDuring the six months ended 30 September 2025, the Company incurred one-off expenses in respect of the proposal to acquire US energy company Dunbar Energy Inc. in an all-share RTO, subject (inter alia) to due diligence and approval by the Company's shareholders.\nCurrent liabilities of \u00a31.4m included in the Company's and Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at 31 March 2025 were derecognised in April 2025 following proposals for the Company's CVA becoming unconditional. These liabilities therefore no longer existed after April 2025 and the derecognition of these has been credited to the Income Statement.\nDuring the period, the Group incurred a net cash inflow of \u00a3297k (2024: outflow of \u00a330k). At 30 September 2025, the Company held cash at bank of \u00a3537k.\nNo dividends were paid. The directors do not recommend payment of an interim dividend.\nBasis of preparation\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. See note 2.3 for key matters assessed by the Directors in determining that the half-year financial statements should be prepared on a going concern basis.\nRichard Horwood\nDirector\n31 December 2025\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2025\nNote\nSix months ended\n30/9/25\nSix months ended 30/9/24\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nContinuing operations\nOther income:\n- Derecognition of liabilities\n4\n1,351\n-\nAdministration expenses:\n- Acquisition costs\n- Other costs\n6\n(259)\n(193)\n(585)\n-\nOperating profit / (loss)\n899\n(585)\nFinance costs\n(1)\n(5)\nFinance income- interest received\n2\n3\nProfit / (loss) before income tax\n900\n(587)\nIncome tax\n-\n-\nProfit / (loss) for the period from continuing operations\n900\n(587)\nLoss from discontinued operations\n7\n-\n(3,681)\nProfit / (loss) for the period\nOther comprehensive income:\n900\n(4,268)\nItems that may be reclassified to profit or loss\nGains on translation of foreign operations\n-\n28\nProfit / (loss) and other comprehensive income for the period\n900\n(4,240)\nEarnings (loss) per share:\nBasic (pence) - continuing operations\n8\n0.05\n-\nBasic (pence) - discontinued operations\n-\n(2.13)\nDiluted (pence)\n0.04\n(2.13)\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\nAs at 30 September 2025\nAt\n30 Sept 2025\nAt\n31 March 2025\nNote\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n(unaudited)\n(audited)\nNON-CURRENT ASSETS\nProperty, plant and equipment\n2\n3\nCURRENT ASSETS\nReceivables and prepayments\n130\n9\nAssets classified as held for sale\n12\n32\n32\nCash and cash equivalents\n537\n240\n699\n281\nTOTAL ASSETS\n701\n284\nSHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY\nShare capital\n9\n1,481\n1,286\nShare premium\nForeign currency translation reserve\n9\n4,585\n(56)\n3,704\n(56)\nShare-based payment reserve\n9\n84\n64\nAccumulated losses\n(6,128)\n(7,028)\nTOTAL EQUITY- (deficiency)\n(34)\n(2,030)\nCURRENT LIABILITIES\nBorrowings\n10\n45\n55\nTrade and other payables\n11\n85\n1,404\nLiabilities classified as held for sale\n12\n570\n570\nShares to be issued\n35\n285\nTOTAL LIABILITIES\n735\n2,314\nTOTAL EQUITY AND LIABILITIES\n701\n284\nThese financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors and authorised for issue on 31 December 2025 and were signed on its behalf by:\nRichard Horwood, Director\nCompany number 13288812\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2025\nShare capital\nShare premium\nRetained losses\nShare-based payment reserve\nForeign currency trans-lation reserve\nTotals\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nAt 1 April 2025\n1,286\n3,704\n(7,028)\n64\n(56)\n(2,030)\nChanges in equity\nNew shares issued during the period\n195\n920\n-\n-\n-\n1,115\nCosts of share issues\n-\n(39)\n-\n-\n-\n(39)\nShare based payments\n-\n-\n-\n20\n-\n20\nProfit for the period\n-\n-\n900\n-\n-\n900\nAt 30 September 2025\n(unaudited)\n1,481\n4,585\n(6,128)\n84\n(56)\n(34)\nAt 1 April 2024\n(audited)\n289\n949\n(2,146)\n-\n-\n(908)\nChange in equity\nNew shares issued during the period\n927\n2,700\n-\n-\n-\n3,627\nShare based payments\n-\n-\n-\n49\n-\n49\nForeign exchange translation gains\n-\n-\n-\n-\n28\n28\nLoss for the period\n-\n-\n(4,268)\n-\n-\n(4,268)\nAt 30 September 2024\n(unaudited)\n1,216\n3,649\n(6,414)\n49\n28\n(1,472)\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2025\n6 months\nended\n30 Sept\n2025\n6 months\nended\n30 Sept\n2024\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nCash flow from operating activities\n(unaudited)\n(unaudited)\nProfit / (loss) for the period\n900\n(4,268)\nAdjustments for:\nDerecognition of CVA liabilities\n(1,351)\n-\nFinance costs\n-\n5\nFinance income\n(2)\n(3)\nShare-based payment charges\n20\n49\nDepreciation charges\n-\n1\nImpairment of goodwill\n-\n2,269\nForeign currency differences\n-\n(28)\n(Increase) / decrease in other receivables\n(117)\n74\nIncrease in trade and other payables\n94\n535\nNet cash used in operating activities\n(456)\n(1,366)\nCash flow from investing activities\nFinance income\n2\n3\nNet cash from investing activities\n2\n3\nCash flow from financing activities\nProceeds from issue of shares\n751\n1,323\nNet proceeds from borrowings\n-\n10\nNet cash from financing activities\n751\n1,333\nNet increase / (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n297\n(30)\nCash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period\n240\n-\nCash acquired on acquisition of subsidiaries\n-\n53\nCash and cash equivalents at the end of the period\n537\n23\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2025\n1. General information\nElectric Guitar Plc is a public limited company, registered in England and Wales. The Company's registered office is One Bartholomew Close, London, EC1A 7BL.\nIn May 2024, the Company cancelled the listing of its Ordinary shares on the Standard Segment of the Official List and its Ordinary shares were admitted to trading on AIM, a market operated by the London Stock Exchange. Further to the Company's announcement of 24 December 2024 regarding the liquidation of 3radical, the Company's operating subsidiary, the Company was reclassified as a cash shell pursuant to Rule 15 of the AIM Rules. Restoration of trading in its Ordinary shares on AIM took place on 2 April 2025, and was suspended again on 25 June 2025 as it had not acquired a new trading company within 6 months of its becoming a cash shell.\nFollowing approval of the Company's CVA on 27 March 2025 and the Company's main subsidiary 3radical being put into liquidation, the principal activity of the Company during the period to 30 September 2025 was that of identifying potential companies, businesses, or assets for acquisition. The 3radical liquidation is currently in progress with the value of asset realisations to be confirmed on completion, which the directors are advised is expected in the first half of 2026.\nThe functional and presentational currency is Great British Pounds Sterling ('\n\u00a3\n') and the financial statements have been rounded to nearest thousands of pounds (\u00a3'000).\n2. Significant accounting policies\nThe following significant accounting policies have been applied:\n2.1 Basis of preparation\nThese half-year financial statements for the Company and its subsidiaries ('the\nGroup\n') have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the recognition and measurement requirements of UK adopted International Financial Reporting Standards (UK adopted IFRS).\nIn December 2024, 3radical, the Company's main subsidiary was put into liquidation. The directors also restructured the operations and debt of the Company through a CVA in March 2025 which was formally completed in October 2025. Assets are held at their net realisable value. Liabilities are stated at their expected settlement amount.\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2025 (continued)\n2. Accounting policies (continued)\n2.2 3 radical Limited - liquidation basis of accounting\nAs 3radical has been placed into administration and a creditors' voluntary liquidation ('\nCVL\n'), the financial position and results relating to this company and its subsidiary entities at 30 September 2025 have been accounted for on a basis other than going concern in the condensed consolidated financial statements for the period ended 30 September 2025. Accordingly, all assets and liabilities relating to these companies have been classified as current, and assets have been written down to their estimated realisable value at 30 September 2025.\n2.3 Going Concern\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Board has assessed the Company's financial position as at 30 September 2025 and the factors which may impact the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements.\nAs at 30 September 2025, the Group had a deficiency in total equity of \u00a334,000. Excluding other income from the derecognition of liabilities arising from the CVA, the Group generated a loss for the period ended 30 September 2025 of \u00a3451,000 and a net cash outflow from operating activities of \u00a3456,000. The deficiency in equity of \u00a334,000 at 30 September 2025 was after current liabilities of \u00a31.4 million were derecognised in April 2025 following proposals for the Company's CVA becoming unconditional. These liabilities therefore no longer existed after April 2025.\nAs at 30 September 2025, liabilities include approximately \u00a3533k classified as held for sale for the 3radical Group. These entities are in liquidation and the Company has no obligation to settle these amounts.\nIn assessing the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern and pay its debts as and when they fall due, the directors have taken into consideration the following matters:\nOn 13 October 2025, the CVA was completed with 236,782,175 new Ordinary shares issued in satisfaction of all the CVA debts, and the outstanding \u00a345,000 of CLNs were converted into 306,665,817 new Ordinary shares, leaving the Company completely free of all its pre-CVA debts.\nManagement and the directors have considered each of these matters and what the enlarged Group (Electric Guitar PLC as potentially enlarged by the RTO of Dunbar) is expected to look like following the completion of the anticipated RTO, which will only be completed on the basis that the transaction includes sufficient working capital for the enlarged Group's requirements for at least 12 months after completion of the RTO.\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2025 (continued)\n2. Accounting policies (continued)\nThe directors have also assessed the Company's ability to continue as a standalone entity in the event no acquisition is pursued and completed in the period to December 2026.\nCashflow projections have also been prepared on this basis which support the directors' view that the Company has sufficient facilities to meet its obligations for the period to 31 December 2026 and pay its debts as they fall due. There is, however, no guarantee the directors would be successful in raising additional financing for its future growth and working capital should this be required. This matter indicates that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern at the time of approval of the condensed financial statements.\nThe key matters assessed by the directors in considering the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for the period to 31 December 2026 are summarised below.\n-\nThe directors have assessed the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern both as a standalone entity (should the anticipated RTO not complete) and in the anticipated scenario where the RTO of Dunbar concludes. The proposed terms of the Dunbar acquisition include a condition requiring Dunbar to have raised sufficient working capital for the enlarged Group for 18 months. There is however no guarantee that the proposed transaction will be completed in accordance with the proposed terms or that the Group, as enlarged by the RTO of Dunbar, will perform in accordance with any projections prepared for the period following completion.\n-\nManagement has prepared detailed cashflow forecasts for the Company on a standalone basis (should the anticipated RTO not proceed to completion) and the management of Dunbar is preparing similar forecasts for the enlarged Group for the 18-month period following completion of the proposed RTO of Dunbar. Before entering into binding contracts to acquire Dunbar, the directors will review and approve Dunbar's forecasts, following thorough testing of them by the Company's RTO reporting accountants.\n-\nAs part of its assessment of the forecasts, certain sensitivity analyses will be run on the forecast model for the enlarged Group. In the event the enlarged Group's actual sales for the period ending 12 months after completion of the proposed RTO would be lower than forecast and certain controllable costs were to be deferred, the tests will be required to show that the Group should still have the ability to operate and pay its debts as and when they fall due for the same period as above, but this cannot be guaranteed.\n-\nIn the event that the proposed RTO does not proceed, and no other acquisitions are pursued in the year to 31 December 2026, the Company would continue to be a cash shell. As noted above, the standalone forecasts prepared by the Company show that the Company has sufficient facilities to meet its obligations for the period to 31 December 2026 and pay its debts as they fall due.\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2025 (continued)\n2. Accounting policies (continued)\n-\nThere is, however, no guarantee the directors would be successful in raising additional financing for its future growth and working capital should this be required.\nThe financial statements do not include adjustments should the going concern basis be inappropriate. Nonetheless, in view of the successful track record of raising financing in the last year from both equity and debt sources and other available funding options, the directors are confident they would be successful in raising any necessary financing within the next 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements.\nFor these reasons, the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.\n2.4 Basis of consolidation\nThe financial statements of the Group consolidate the results of the Company and its subsidiary entities. A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its influence over the entity.\nThe financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the condensed consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases.\nThe consolidated financial statements present the results of the Company and its subsidiaries (the Group) as if they formed a single entity. Intercompany transactions and balances, including unrealised gains/losses between group companies are therefore eliminated in full.\nWhere the Group ceases to control a subsidiary, the subsidiary is deconsolidated from the date which control ceases. The net assets of the subsidiary are included in a disposal calculation along with any consideration received from the disposal, with any gain or loss recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n2.5 Cash and cash equivalent\ns\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank.\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2025 (continued)\n2. Accounting policies (continued)\n2.6 Share capital and share premium\nShare capital represents the nominal value of shares that have been issued. Share premium includes any premiums received on issue of share capital. Any transactions costs associated with the issuing of shares are deducted from share premium.\n2.7 Provisions for liabilities\nProvisions are made where an event has taken place that gives the group a legal or constructive obligation that requires settlement by a transfer of economic benefit, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\nProvisions are charged as an expense to the income statement in the period that the group becomes aware of the obligation and are measured at the best estimate at the reporting date of the expenditure required to settle the obligation, after taking into account relevant risks and uncertainties. When payments are eventually made, they are charged to the provision carried in the balance sheet.\n2.8 Trade and other payables\nTrade and other payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Accruals and accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n2.9 Financial liabilities\nAll financial liabilities are recognised in the condensed consolidated statement of financial position when the Company or its subsidiaries becomes party to the contractual provision of a financial instrument.\nFinancial liabilities measured at amortised cost\nFinancial liabilities held at amortised cost comprise trade payables and other payables and borrowings.\nThese financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value net of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the instrument. Such interest-bearing liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, which ensures that any interest expense over the period to repayment is at a market rate on the balance of the liability carried in the condensed consolidated statement of financial position.\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2025 (continued)\n2. Accounting policies (continued)\n2.9 Financial liabilities (continued)\nSubsequent measurement\nThe amortised cost of a financial liability is the amount at which the financial liability is measured on initial recognition, minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using effective interest method of any difference between the initial amount recognised and the maturity amount. Such amortisation amounts are recognised in the condensed consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Due to the short-term nature of trade and other payables, they are stated at their nominal value, which approximates their fair value.\n2.10 Employee benefits\nThe costs of short-term employee benefits are recognised as a liability and an expense. The cost of any unused holiday entitlement is recognised in the period in which the employee's services are received.\n2.11 Business combinations\nThe condensed consolidated half-year financial statements incorporate the results of Electric Guitar plc and its subsidiaries as at 30 September 2025 and for the six months period then ended using the acquisition method of accounting.\nBusiness combinations falling within the scope of IFRS 3 Business Combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the group.\nThe Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as the fair value of the consideration transferred less the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nCosts relating to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of equity instruments, are expensed as incurred.\n3. Critical accounting judgements and estimates\nThe preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with UK adopted IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise their judgment in applying the Company's accounting policies.\nEstimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including future conditions that are assessed to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nNOTES TO THE INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nfor the six months ended 30 September 2025 (continued)\n3.
