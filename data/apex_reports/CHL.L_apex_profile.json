Advisory work was undertaken, including financial due diligence and associated processes around the RTO. The Company's shares remained suspended during the period and operating costs were kept to a minimum.\nSubsequent Events and Future Strategy\nThe target of the RTO is a business in the media, events and technology space which has been introduced to the Company by Salonica Capital Ltd, which represents Salonica GP, the general partner for Salonica Play LP, the owner of approximately 65% of the Company's issued share capital. Whilst timelines have been extended compared to the original plan, this has allowed the target to strengthen its commercial foundations in support of the creation of medium-to- long term shareholder value as an AIM listed company. This has also included the appointment of an experienced CEO (Rob Proctor) in the media and technology sectors to lead the combined business; further details are set out below.\nConsequently, the Company is pleased to announce that the RTO target has signed two substantial commercial contracts with major regional and international broadcasters in high growth vertical and geographic markets. These partnerships represent significant customer validation of the Company's proposition and will help underpin the Company's financial performance and growth trajectory post completion of the RTO. Having taken specialist advice, the Company now expects that it will qualify, subject to usual HMRC processes, for EIS and VCT purposes.\nThe Company is targeting completion of the RTO in Q2 2026 and is actively working on the associated processes. To provide additional cash resources to cover non contingent advisory fees as well as routine operations of the shell, the Company has raised a further \u00a3250,000 (gross) from Salonica Play LP by way of a Convertible Loan Note (\"CLN\") the details of which are set out below.\nConvertible Loan Note\nThe Company is in the process of agreeing an unsecured convertible loan note (the \"Note\") from Salonica Play LP (the \"Lender\") to support the completion of the RTO. The principal amount is expected to be \u00a3250,000, with an expected arrangement fee of \u00a331,250 (which is to be deducted from drawdown without reducing the face value). At completion of the RTO, Salonica Play LP would have the right to require repayment of the Note, provided that it has sourced the specific replacement capital. The Note is expected to carry an annualised straight-line coupon of 17.5%. On completion of the RTO, the Note will convert into ordinary shares which will benefit from the bonus share issue referenced in the RNS of 28 October 2024. The main terms of the Note have been agreed in principle, and it is expected to be finalised and drawn down around the end of January 2026.\nAppointment of Director and CEO Designate\nThe Company is pleased to announce the appointment of Robert ('Rob') Proctor as a Non-Executive Director of the Company with immediate effect. It is intended that Rob will be appointed to the role of CEO on completion of the RTO. Rob is a highly experienced digital media and entertainment executive and serial entrepreneur with over three decades in the entertainment, technology, media and infrastructure sectors. He has held C-level positions in public and private companies, including as CEO of Allied Esports International in Las Vegas and CEO of Audioboom Group plc (AIM: BOOM), where he led the transformation of the business from a start-up into a fully listed public company that became the fourth largest podcast company globally.\nDuring his tenure at Audioboom from 2012 to 2019, listenership grew nearly 2,000% to over 1.6 billion impressions, with annual revenues exceeding $22 million. Rob has been a pioneer in internet, mobile technology, streaming media and podcasting, and brings extensive expertise in content creation, distribution, public markets and corporate finance. The Board believes that Rob's considerable experience will be invaluable as the Company pursues its growth strategy.\nEnquiries:\nCloudified Holdings Limited\nOthman Shoukat (Director)\nIan Selby (Director)\nVia IFC\nZeus Capital\nMike Coe / James Bavister (Nomad)\n+ 44 (0) 203 829 5000\nIFC Advisory Ltd\nFinancial PR & IR\nGraham Herring / Zach Cohen\n+44 (0) 203 934 6630\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nFOR THE SIX MONTHS PERIOD ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2025\n6 Months to\n6 Months to\nYear to\n30 Sep 2025\n30 Sep 2024\n31 Mar 2025\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\n(Audited)\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nRevenue\n-\n-\n-\nCost of sales\n-\n-\n-\nGross profit\n-\n-\n-\nAdministrative expenses\n(240,593)\n(149,094)\n(280,674)\nOperating loss\n(240,593)\n(149,094)\n(280,674)\nFinance income\n3,433\n5,124\n9,591\nFinance expense\n-\n(1,424)\n(1,424)\nNet finance income\n3,433\n3,700\n8,167\nLoss before income tax\n(237,160)\n(145,394)\n(272,507)\nIncome tax credit\n-\n-\n-\nLoss for the period from continuing operations\n(237,160)\n(145,394)\n(272,507)\nLoss for the period\n(237,160)\n(145,394)\n(272,507)\nOther comprehensive income:\n-\n-\n-\nTotal comprehensive loss for the period\n(237,160)\n(145,394)\n(272,507)\nLoss per share from continuing operations\nBasic & diluted loss per share\n(3) p\n(3) p\n(3) p\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\nAS AT 30 SEPTEMBER 2025\n6 Months to\n6 Months to\nYear to\n30 Sep 2025\n30 Sep 2024\n31 Mar 2025\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\n(Audited)\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nAssets\nCurrent assets\nTrade and other receivables\n11,078\n15,767\n48,220\nCash and cash equivalents\n233,204\n334,613\n460,221\nTotal assets\n244,282\n350,380\n508,441\nEquity\nCapital and reserves attributable to equity holders of the Company\nShare premium account\n4,436,968\n4,035,003\n4,436,968\nShare based payment reserve\n180,048\n462,386\n180,048\nRetained earnings\n(4,402,379)\n(4,251,268)\n(4,165,219)\nTotal equity\n214,637\n246,121\n451,797\nLiabilities\nCurrent liabilities\nTrade and other payables\n29,645\n104,259\n56,644\nTotal liabilities\n29,645\n104,259\n56,644\nTotal equity and liabilities\n244,282\n350,380\n508,441\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nShare\nAccumulated\nShare based\ncapital\nlosses\npayment reserve\nTotal\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nBalance at 1 April 2024\n4,035,003\n(4,105,874)\n462,386\n391,515\nLoss for the year\n-\n(272,507)\n-\n(272,507)\nTransactions with owners:\nIssue of share capital\n500,000\n-\n-\n500,000\nCosts of issue of share capital\n(98,035)\n-\n-\n(98,035)\nShare based payment charge\n-\n-\n(69,176)\n(69,176)\nForfeited share options reversed through reserves\n-\n213,162\n(213,162)\n-\nBalance at 31 March 2024\n4,436,968\n(4,165,219)\n180,048\n451,797\nLoss for the period\n-\n(237,160)\n-\n(237,160)\nTransactions with owners:\nIssue of share capital\n-\n-\n-\n-\nShare based payment charge\n-\n-\n-\n-\nBalance as at 30 September 2024\n4,436,968\n(4,402,379)\n180,048\n214,637\nCONSOLIDATED CASH FLOW STATEMENT FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2025\n6 Months to\n6 Months to\nYear to\n30 Sep 2025\n30 Sep 2024\n31 Mar 2025\n(Unaudited)\n(Unaudited)\n(Audited)\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nCash flows from operating activities\n(Loss) / profit before tax\n(237,160)\n(145,394)\n(272,507))\nAdjustments for:\nShare based payment\n-\n-\n(69,176)\nNet finance (income) / expense recognised in profit or loss\n(3,433)\n(3,700)\n(8,167)\n(240,593)\n(149,094)\n(349,850)\nChanges in working capital:\nDecrease in trade and other receivables\n37,142\n52,973\n20,520\n(Decrease) / increase in trade and other payables\n(26,999)\n(103,458)\n(151,073)\nCash generated from / used in operations\n(230,450)\n(199,579)\n(480,403)\nInterest paid\n-\n(1,424)\n(1,424)\nNet cash used in operating activities\n(230,450)\n(201,003)\n(481,827)\nCash flows from investing activities\nInterest received\n3,433\n5,124\n9,591\nProceeds from disposal of fixed assets\n-\n-\n-\nProceeds from disposal of subsidiaries, net of cash\n-\n-\n-\nNet cash used in investing activities\n3,433\n5,124\n9,591\nCash flows from financing activities\nProceeds from issue of shares\n-\n-\n500,000\nShare issuance costs\n-\n-\n(98,035)\nNet cash used in / generated from financing activities\n-\n-\n401,965\nDecrease / (Increase) in cash equivalents\n(227,017)\n(195,879)\n(70,271)\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of the period\n460,221\n530,492\n530,492\nCash and cash equivalents at end of the period\n233,204\n334,613\n460,221\nNOTES TO INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE PERIOD ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2025\n1. General information\nCloudified Holdings Limited (the \"Company\" or \"Cloudified\") is a cash shell under Rule 15 of the AIM rules. This followed the disposal of its trading subsidiaries in the cyber security division on 12 December 2023.\nAll other subsidiaries which were dormant were dissolved in the year ended 31 March 2025. The Company is a public limited company which is listed on the AIM Market of the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled in the British Virgin Islands. The address of its registered office is PO Box 173, Kingston Chambers, Road Town, Tortola, British Virgin Islands. The UK registered office is c/o Blake Morgan LLP, Apex Plaza, Forbury Road, Reading, RG1 1AX.\n2. Basis of preparation\nThese interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with\nUK adopted International Accounting Standards\n. They do not contain all the information required for full financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and for the year ended 31 March 2025. These interim financial statements do not constitute statutory accounts within the meaning of the Companies Act.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Company's accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note 3.\nThe interim financial information has not been reviewed nor audited by the auditors. The interim financial information was approved by the Board of Directors\non 15 January 2026\n. The information for the year ended 31 March 2025 is extracted from the statutory financial statements for that year which have been reported on by the Company's auditors and delivered to the Registrar of Companies.\nThe accounting policies applied by the Company in these interim financial statements are the same as those applied by the Company in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended and as of 31 March 2025. The interim report is the responsibility of, and has been, approved by the Directors.\u00a0The Directors are responsible for preparing the interim financial statements in accordance with the AIM rules for Companies.\nGoing Concern\nThe Company is now a cash shell with no trading operations which is currently in advanced stages of an RTO. On 7 January 2026 it had cash balances of \u00a3168,000 and an expected cash consumption of c\u00a330,000 per month comprising of directors' fees and typical PLC running costs. The proceeds from the proposed CLN from Salonica will augment cash balances on drawdown and will allow coverage of professional fees and abort costs (should the scenario arise) as the transaction progresses with a target completion in Q2 2026.\nThe definition of a going concern is that of \"any entity unless its management intends to liquidate the entity or to cease trading or has no realistic alternative to liquidation or cessation of operations\". The directors took the decision to cease trading through the disposal in December 2023 of all the trading subsidiaries of the Company and, as such, have prepared these interim results on a basis other than a going concern. The directors do not consider that this basis of preparation has given rise to any material differences compared to the financial statements prepared on a going concern basis.\n3. Critical accounting estimates and judgements\nThe preparation of the Company financial statements in conformity with IFRSs as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Company's accounting policies.

This Investment is being deployed to support the acquisition of an asset identified by Salonica in the media and entertainment sector (the \"Acquisition\"). The Acquisition, if completed, will constitute a reverse takeover under Rule 14 of the AIM Rules.\n\u00b7\nOthman Shoukat and Richard Collett joined the board on 13 November 2024.\n\u00b7\nThe board is currently focussed on completion of the Acquisition. The project is progressing, and funds are now being used on customary due diligence and legal processes.\n\u00b7\nCash at 30 June 2025 c\u00a30.36m with an ongoing cost base of c\u00a330k/m (excluding Acquisition transaction costs).\nThe Annual Report & Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2025 will shortly be available on the Company's website (\nhttps://cloudified-holdings.com/reports-and-results\n) in accordance with the electronic communication provisions under its Articles of Association and AIM Rule 20.\nEnquiries:\nCloudified Holdings Limited\nIan Selby, Director\nVia IFC\nZeus (\nNOMAD & Broker)\nMike Coe/ James Bavister\n+ 44 (0) 203 829 5000\nIFC Advisory Ltd\nFinancial PR & IR\nGraham Herring / Zach Cohen\n+44 (0) 203 934 6630\nStrategic Report\nThe Directors present the Strategic Report of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2025.\nBusiness Review\nHistorically, the Group functioned as a provider of cyber security services to the SME market via former trading subsidiaries. On 12 December 2023, the Group finalised the sale of its cyber security assets (Falanx Cyber Defence Ltd and Falanx Cyber Technologies Limited), transitioning to a cash shell in accordance with AIM Rule 15 on the same day.\nFollowing the disposal, the board of Alex Hambro and Ian Selby (with Mike Read having retired on 3 April 2024) evaluated over thirty opportunities for potential reverse takeover candidates. Opportunities were carefully screened for their likelihood of successfully completing a transaction as well as for their ability to demonstrate credible business plans to support future growth. Costs were kept to a minimum to support this process, and no external advisory costs would be incurred unless the deal was credible and risk sharing with the target was in place. In parallel to this, a plan was developed to put the company into a Members Voluntary Liquidation (\"MVL\") if the board, in conjunction with its advisors, deemed it unrealistic to expect an appropriate transaction to complete in a realistic time frame. All other subsidiaries (which were dormant) were dissolved during the year.\nOn 13 June 2024, the Company's shares were suspended from trading on the AIM market as it was not able to make an acquisition or acquisitions which constituted a reverse takeover under Rule 14 of the AIM Rules, within six months of becoming an AIM Rule 15 cash shell, in accordance with Rule 15 of the AIM Rules.\nOn 28 October 2024, the Company announced a refinancing of \u00a3500,000 (before expenses of c\u00a399,000), through a subscription for 9,615,385 new Ordinary Shares at an issue price of 5.20 pence per new Ordinary Share, representing a 131% premium to the last share price, and also to the expected proceeds from an MVL. The investment was made by Salonica GP (advised by Salonica Capital Ltd) and is to support the execution of an RTO by the acquisition of an identified asset (the \"Acquisition\"), as set out below, in the media and entertainment sector. On 13 November 2024 the investment was completed following approval by the Company's shareholders and Othman Shoukat and Richard Collett joined the Board.\nThe Acquisition, which was introduced by Salonica Capital, will be of a newly incorporated company which has been established to acquire the global distribution rights of certain media assets and technology licences from an established international media company. Its management team, who are highly experienced in this sector, are focussing their plans on driving recurring revenues from these assets as well as event specific revenues. The Acquisition is currently expected to complete in the fourth quarter of 2025. Consideration for the Acquisition is expected to be settled via the issue of new Ordinary Shares in the capital of the Company. A fundraising may be undertaken alongside this to accelerate the development and growth of the Company, as well as to settle certain transaction costs. Should the Acquisition complete as envisaged, shareholders will each receive a further seven new Ordinary Shares by way of bonus issue for every four Ordinary Shares they hold. This will increase the uplift to shareholders to 536% compared to the last quoted price.\nIn the year to 31 March 2025, costs comprised solely of items necessary to operate the cash shell. Net assets on 31 March 2025 primarily consisted of cash balances of \u00a30.46m with other amounts arising from routine amounts for debtors, prepayments, trade payables, payroll taxes and accruals. Overall shareholders' funds were \u00a30.45m (2024: \u00a30.39m)\nSubsequent Events Review and Future Strategy\nSince the balance sheet date, the board has been focussed on completion of the RTO. The project is progressing, and funds are now being used on customary due diligence and legal processes. The Company's shares remain suspended from trading on AIM until 20th October 2025. Cash balances on 30 June 2025 were \u00a30.36m and the average monthly expenditure (excluding transaction costs) is approximately \u00a30.026m\nConsolidated income statement\nfor the year ended 31 March 2025\n2025\n2024\nNote\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nRevenue\n4\n-\n13,935\nCost of sales\n-\n-\nGross profit\n-\n13,935\nAdministrative expenses (continuing operations)\n(280,674)\n(1,479,951)\nOperating loss\n(280,674)\n(1,466,016)\nFinance income\n9,591\n8,764\nFinance expense\n(1,424)\n(1,021)\nFinance income - net\n8,167\n7,743\nLoss before income tax\n(272,507)\n(1,458,273)\nIncome tax expense\n-\n-\nLoss for the year from continuing operations\n(272,507)\n(1,458,273)\nDiscontinued operations\nProfit for the year from discontinued operations\n-\n51,391\nLoss for the year\n(272,507)\n(1,406,882)\nLoss per share from continuing operations\nBasic & diluted loss per share\n6\n(3) p\n(28) p\nProfit per share from discontinued operations\nBasic and diluted profit per share\n6\n-\n0.98 p\n2025\n2024\nNote\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nLoss for the year\n(272,507)\n(1,406,882)\nTotal comprehensive loss for the year\n(272,507)\n(1,406,882)\nAttributable to:\nOwners of the parent\nContinuing operations\n(272,507)\n(1,458,273)\nDiscontinued operations\n5\n-\n51,391\nTotal comprehensive loss for the year\n(272,507)\n(1,406,882)\nConsolidated statement of financial position\nas at 31 March 2025\n2025\n2024\nNote\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nAssets\nCurrent assets\nTrade and other receivables\n48,220\n68,740\nCash and cash equivalents\n460,221\n530,492\nTotal assets\n508,441\n599,232\nEquity\nCapital and reserves attributable to equity holders of the Company\nShare capital\n4,436,968\n4,035,003\nShare based payment reserve\n180,048\n462,386\nAccumulated losses\n(4,165,219)\n(4,105,874)\nTotal equity\n451,797\n391,515\nLiabilities\nCurrent liabilities\nTrade and other payables\n56,644\n207,717\nTotal liabilities\n56,644\n207,717\nTotal equity and liabilities\n508,441\n599,232\nConsolidated statement of changes in equity\nfor the year ended 31 March 2025\nShare\nAccumulated\nShare based\nNote\ncapital\nlosses\npayment reserve\nTotal\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nBalance at 1 April 2023\n4,035,003\n(2,930,008)\n697,900\n1,802,895\nLoss for the year\n-\n(1,406,882)\n-\n(1,406,882)\nTransactions with owners:\nShare based payment charge\n-\n-\n(4,498)\n(4,498)\nForfeited share options reversed through reserves\n-\n231,016\n(231,016)\n-\nBalance at 31 March 2024\n4,035,003\n(4,105,874)\n462,386\n391,515\nProfit for the year\n-\n(272,507)\n-\n(272,507)\nTransactions with owners:\nIssue of share capital\n500,000\n-\n-\n500,000\nCosts of issue of share capital\n(98,035)\n-\n-\n(98,035)\nShare based payment charge\n-\n-\n(69,176)\n(69,176)\nForfeited share options reversed through reserves\n-\n213,162\n(213,162)\n-\nBalance as at 31 March 2025\n4,436,968\n(4,165,219)\n180,048\n451,797\nThe share capital account represents the amount subscribed for share capital, net of share issue expenses.

General information\nCloudified Holdings Limited (the \"Company\" or \"Cloudified\") is a cash shell under Rule 15 of the AIM rules. This followed the disposal of its trading subsidiaries in the cyber security division on 12 December 2023.\nThe Company is a public limited company which is listed on the AIM Market of the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled in the British Virgin Islands. The address of its registered office is PO Box 173, Kingston Chambers, Road Town, Tortola, British Virgin Islands. The UK registered office is c/o Blake Morgan LLP, Apex Plaza, Forbury Road, Reading, RG1 1AX.\n2. Summary of significant accounting policies\nThe principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have been applied consistently to all the years presented unless otherwise stated.\n2.1 Basis of preparation\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with\nUK adopted International Accounting Standards\n. Whilst it had no subsidiaries at the balance sheet date, the Company had subsidiaries for a portion of the year and was therefore a parent company in accordance with IFRS10. The functional and presentational currency for the financial statements is Sterling. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note 3.\n2.1.1 Going concern\nThe company is a cash shell with no trading operations. On 12 December 2023 the Company sold its Cyber Division, this sale included a Warranties and Indemnities insurance policy which caps the Company's liabilities (save in the case of fraud) at \u00a31. On 30 June 2025 the Company had cash balances of \u00a3359,580 and has an expected cash consumption of c\u00a330,000 per month comprising of directors' fees, audit fees and usual PLC running costs.\nThe Company is currently conducting an acquisition which will constitute an RTO, however, there is a risk that fees associated with the transaction could exceed the Company's financial resources before the transaction is completed. The impact of any successful RTO has been excluded from our assessment of going concern as its outcome as to timing and cash flows is inherently uncertain.\nHaving ceased trading operations in December 2023, and the uncertainty inherent in the proposed RTO transaction, the Directors consider that preparing the financial statements on a basis other than a going concern remains appropriate. They consider that preparing the accounts on such a basis has no material impact on the presentation of the numbers in the financial statements.\n2.1.2 New and Revised Standards\nNew and amended IFRS Accounting Standards that are effective for the current year\nThere are a number of standards and amendments to standards which have been issued by the IASB that are effective in future accounting periods that have not been adopted early. The following standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024:\n\u00b7\nIFRS 17 Insurance Contracts\n\u00b7\nClassification of liabilities as current or non-current (Amendments to IAS 1)\n\u00b7\nDeferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction (Amendments to IAS 12)\n\u00b7\nLease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback (Amendments to IFRS 16)\n\u00b7\nClassification of Financial Instruments (Amendments to IFRS 9)\n\u00b7\nNon-current liabilities with covenants (Amendments to IAS 1)\n\u00b7\nSupplier Finance Arrangements (Amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7)\nNew and revised IFRS Accounting Standards in issue but not yet effective\nThe following amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2025:\n\u00b7\nGuidance on the exchange rate to use when a currency is not exchangeable (Amendments to IAS 21)\n\u00b7\nAccounting treatment for the sale or contribution of assets (Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28)\nThe following standards are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2027:\n\u00b7\nIFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements\n\u00b7\nIFRS 19 Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures\n2.2 Consolidation\nSubsidiaries\nSubsidiary undertakings are entities that are controlled by the Company. The definition of control involves three elements: power over the investee; exposure or rights to variable returns and the ability to use the power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor's returns. The Group generally obtains power through voting rights. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date at which the Group obtains the relevant level of control and are treated as disposed of, and so de-consolidated from the date at which that control ceases. Whilst it had no subsidiaries at the year end, it was a Parent company during the year as defined by IFRS10.\nThe acquisition method of accounting is used for all business combinations. On acquisition, the cost is measured at the aggregate of their fair values at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquire. Any costs directly attributable to the business combination are expensed as incurred. The acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 (Revised), \"Business Combinations\" are recognised at fair values at the acquisition date.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Group's share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If, after reassessment, the Group's interest in the net fair value of the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the difference is recognised directly in profit or loss. Any subsequent adjustment to reflect changes in consideration arising from contingent consideration amendments are recognised in profit or loss.\nInter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. All subsidiaries are wholly owned by the Group.\n2.3 Segmental reporting\nIn accordance with IFRS 8, segmental information is presented based on the way in which financial information is reported internally to the chief operating decision maker. The Group's internal financial reporting was historically organised along product and service lines, but this as a consequence of the disposal of trading operations on 12 December 2023, has been changed to reflect discontinued and continuing items. A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products and services that are subject to risks and returns which are different from those of other business segments.\n2.4 Revenue recognition\nRevenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of the Group's activities. Revenue is shown net of value-added tax, returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group.\nThe Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity and when specific criteria have been met for each of the Group's activities.\nRevenue is recognised on the following bases:\nClass of revenue Recognition criteria\nSubscription fees straight line basis over the life of the contract\nManaged services straight line basis over the life of the contract\nConsultancy on delivery of service to customers\nVulnerability assessment on delivery of service to customers\nRevenue is recognised as the client receives the benefit of the services provided under a commercial contract, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the provider expects to be entitled for the transfer of the goods or services.\nPerformance obligations and timing of revenue recognition\nRevenue from the provision of professional services such as penetration testing, consultancy and strategic intelligence assignments are recognised as services are rendered, based on the contracted daily billing rate and the number of days delivered during the period. Revenue from pre-paid contracts are deferred in the statement of financial position and recognised on utilisation of service by the client.\nRevenue from cyber monitoring contracts (including installation), intelligence embedded analyst and report subscriptions includes advance payments made by the customer is deferred (as a contract liability) and is then subsequently recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. Where they are billed periodically in a monthly in arrears basis, revenues are recognised at that point.\nContracts values are typically fixed price and the pricing level is based on management experience of pricing adequate mark up of prime cost. Where additional services need to be delivered outside of the contract a time and materials basis based on day rates is used.\nDetermining the transaction price\nThe Group's revenue is derived from fixed price contracts and therefore the amount of revenues to be earned from each contract is determined by reference to those fixed prices. Costs of obtaining long-term contracts and costs of associated sales commissions are prepaid and amortised over the terms of the contract on a straight-line basis. Commissions paid to sale staff for work in obtaining the Prepaid Consultancy are recognised in the month of invoice. The timing and any conditionality for the payment of commissions is governed under the then applicable sales incentive plan.\nRevenues are exclusive of applicable sales taxes and are net of any trade discounts. There are no financing components in any of our revenue streams.\nContract Assets (accrued incomes) balance was \u00a3nil (2022: \u00a321,100) as all arose from assets held for sale and were reflected in that balance. Contract Liabilities (deferred incomes) balance of \u00a3nil (2022: \u00a3529,496) were similarly included in assets held for sale. All contract assets had short cash conversion periods and all assets at the year-end have since been monetised. All contract assets and liabilities related to discontinued items.\nThe Board considers that the information in note 4 adequately depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flow are affected by economic factors.\n2.5 Taxation\nThe tax expense for the year represents the total of current taxation and deferred taxation. The charge in respect of current taxation is based on the estimated taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit for the year is based on the profit as shown in the income statement, as adjusted for items of income or expenditure which are not deductible or chargeable for tax purposes. The current tax liability for the year is calculated using tax rates which have either been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.\nDeferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method on temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying values in the financial statements. Deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates which have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised, or the deferred income tax liability is settled.\nDeferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of tax assets and unutilised tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carrying forward of tax assets and unutilised tax losses can be utilised.\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax assets to be utilised. Conversely, previously unrecognised deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date.\n2.6 Foreign Currency\nThe Company has determined Sterling as its functional currency, as this is the currency of the economic environment in which the Company predominantly operates.\nTransactions in currencies other than Sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each reporting date, the monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the reporting date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Gains and losses arising on exchange are included in profit or loss.\nForeign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised in profit or loss.\nIn the case of foreign entities, the financial statements of the Group's overseas operations are translated as follows on consolidation: assets and liabilities, at exchange rates ruling on reporting date, income and expense items at the average rate of exchange for the period and equity at exchange rates ruling on the dates of the transactions. Exchange differences arising are classified as equity and transferred to a separate translation reserve. Such translation differences are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the operation is disposed of. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreign operation, the settlement of which is neither planned nor likely within the foreseeable future, are considered to form part of net investment in a foreign operation and are recognised directly in equity.\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.\nForeign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis.\n2.7 Impairment of non-financial assets\nAssets that are subject to depreciation or amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. A review for indicators of impairment is performed annually. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Any impairment charge is recognised in the income statement in the year in which it occurs. When an impairment loss, other than an impairment loss on goodwill, subsequently reverses due to a change in the original estimate, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, up to the carrying amount that would have resulted, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.\n2.8 Financial instruments\nThe Group applies a simplified method of the expected credit loss model when calculating impairment losses on its financial assets which are measured at amortised cost such as trade receivables, other debtors and prepayments. This resulted in greater judgement due to the need to factor in forward-looking information when estimating the appropriate amount to provisions.\n(a) Financial Assets\nThe Group's Financial Assets include Cash and Cash Equivalents, Trade Receivables and Other Receivables.\n\u00b7\nInitial Recognition and Measurement\n:\nFinancial Assets are classified as amortised cost and initially measured at fair value.\n\u00b7\nSubsequent Measurement\n:\nFinancial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, less impairment. Interest is recognised by applying the effective interest method, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial. The company only offers short (typically 30 day) periods of credit to its customers.\n\u00b7\nDerecognition of Financial Assets:\nThe Company derecognises a Financial Asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the Financial Asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.\n(b) Financial Liabilities and Equity Instruments\nThe Group's Financial Liabilities include Trade Payables, Accruals and Other Payables. Financial Liabilities are classified at amortised cost.\n(c) Investments\nInvestments not in subsidiary undertakings are carried at fair value through profit and loss.\nClassification as Debt or Equity. Financial Liabilities and Equity Instruments issued by the Company are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions of a Financial Liability and an Equity Instrument.\n2.9 Share capital\nOrdinary shares (of nil par value) in the Company are classified as equity. By definition all amounts arising from the issue of these shares are attributable to Share Capital as are any directly attributable (including any warrants issued as commissions) to issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction to the share capital account. The Company does not maintain a separate share premium account.\n2.10 Reserves\nThe consolidated financial statements include the following reserves: translation reserve, share option reserve, 2022 Liabilities reserve and accumulated losses. Premiums paid on the issue of share capital, less any costs relating to these, are posted to the share capital account as referenced above.\n2.11 Trade payables\nTrade payables are obligations to pay for goods and services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, they are presented as non-current liabilities.\nTrade payables are recognised initially at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. As the payment period of trade payables is short, future cash payments are not discounted as the effect is not material.\n2.12 Pensions\nThe Company operates a defined contribution pension scheme under which fixed contributions are payable. Pension costs charged to the income statement represent amounts payable to the scheme during the year.\n2.13 Share-based payments\nThe cost of share-based payment arrangements, which occur when employees receive shares or share options, is recognised in the income statement over the period over which the shares or share options vest.\nThe expense is calculated based on the value of the awards made, as required by IFRS 2, 'Share-based payment'. The fair value of the awards is calculated by using the Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo option pricing models taking into account the expected life of the awards, the expected volatility of the return on the underlying share price, vesting criteria, the market value of the shares, the strike price of the awards and the risk-free rate of return. The charge to the income statement is adjusted for the effect of service conditions and non-market performance conditions such that it is based on the number of awards expected to vest. Where vesting is dependent on market-based performance conditions, the likelihood of the conditions being achieved is adjusted for in the initial valuation and the charge to the income statement is not, therefore, adjusted so long as all other conditions are met.\nWhere an award is granted with no vesting conditions, the full value of the award is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n2.14 Provisions\nProvisions are recognised in the statement of financial position where there is a legal or constructive obligation to transfer economic benefits as a result of a past event. Provisions are discounted using a rate which reflects the effect of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation, where the effect of discounting is material.\nProvisions are measured at the present value of expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time, value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in provision due to the passage of time is recognised as interest expense.\n3. Critical accounting estimates and judgements\nThe preparation of the Group financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the present circumstances. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the Group financial statements are disclosed below.\nEstimates:\nManagement do not consider there to be significant accounting estimates in respect of the year ended 31 March 2025 or 31 March 2024.\n4. Segmental reporting\nAs described in note 2, the Directors consider that the Group's internal financial reporting is organised along continuing and discontinuing lines of business following the disposal of the strategic intelligence business on 6 October 2021 and the disposal of the remaining cyber business on 12 December 2023.\nAt that point the operations of the group were ceased and remaining infrastructure reorganised to support a cash shell.\nThe results for the business operating segment for the years ended 31 March 2025 and 31 March 2024 are as follows:\n2025\n2024\n2024\n2024\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nContinuing\nDiscontinued\nTotal\nProfessional services\n-\n13,935\n1,882,331\n1,896,266\nMonitoring managed services\n-\n-\n826,435\n826,435\nRevenues from external customers\n-\n13,935\n2,708,766\n2,722,701\nGross Margin\n-\n13,935\n1,155,651\n1,169,586\nCyber operating expenses\n-\n-\n(1,059,607)\n(1,059,607)\nCorporate operating expenses\n(349,848)\n(1,483,657)\n-\n(1,483,657)\nSegment Reported EBITDA\n(349,848)\n(1,469,722)\n96,044\n(1,373,678)\nFinance expense-net\n8,167\n7,743\n(406,415)\n(398,672)\nDepreciation and amortisation\n-\n(792)\n(241,142)\n(241,934)\nShare option credit\n69,174\n4,498\n-\n4,498\nProfit on sale of discontinued operations\n-\n-\n602,904\n602,904\nSegment loss before tax for the year\n(272,507)\n(1,458,273)\n51,391\n(1,406,882)\nSegment assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents.

Discontinued operations\nOn 12 December 2023, the Company disposed of its only trading assets, Falanx Cyber Defence Limited and Falanx Cyber Technologies Limited (together the \"Cyber Division\") for an enterprise value of \u00a34.2 million payable in cash to Thetis Bidco Limited. This represented all of the professional services and monitoring managed services operating segments other than some remaining operating costs supporting the AIM Rule 15 cash shell.\nThe results (for comparative purposes only, as the Company had no discontinued operations in the year ended 31 March 2025) of the discontinued operations and the effect of the discontinued operations on the financial position of the Group were as follows:\nFinancial performance and cash flow information\nResults of the discontinued operations for the year ended 31 March 2024 for Falanx Cyber Defence Limited and Falanx Cyber Technologies Limited\n2024\nCyber\nIncome statement\n\u00a3\nRevenue\n2,708,766\nAdministrative expenses\n(2,853,864)\nOperating loss\n(145,098)\nFinance costs\n(406,415)\nLoss before income tax\n(551,513)\nIncome tax credit\n-\nLoss from discontinued operations before gain on sale\n(551,513)\nProfit on sale of discontinued operations\n602,904\nProfit / (Loss) from discontinued operations\n51,391\n2024\nCash flows from/(used in) discontinued operations\n\u00a3\nNet cash flows from operating activities\n444,594\nNet cash flows from investing activities\n1,331\nNet cash flows from financing activities\n(609,784)\nNet cash flows for the year\n(163,859)\nIntra-Group funding and transactions\n192,756\nNet cash flows from discontinued operations, net of intercompany\n28,897\nNet cash flows from investing activities does not include proceeds from the disposal of discontinued operations of \u00a31,181,148 which were accounted for by the parent company.

Basic and diluted earnings per share\nBasic loss per share is calculated by dividing the loss attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. There are no dilutive share options at present as these would currently increase the loss per share.\nContinuing operations\n2025\n2024\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nLoss for the year attributable to equity holders of the Company\n(272,507)\n(1,406,882)\nLess profit / (loss) from discontinued operations\n-\n51,391\nLoss from continuing operations\n(272,507)\n(1,458,273)\nTotal basic and diluted (loss)/profit per share from continuing operations (pence per share)\n(3) p\n(28) p\nContinuing and discontinued operations\n2025\n2024\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n(Loss) / Profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the Company\n(272,507)\n(1,406,882)\nTotal basic and diluted profit / (loss) per share (pence per share)\n(3) p\n(27) p\nWeighted average number of shares used as the denominator\n2025\n2024\nWeighted average number of ordinary shares used as the denominator in the calculating basic earnings per share\n8,925,961\n5,264,212\nDiluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue to assume the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The Company's dilutive potential ordinary shares arise from warrants and share options. In respect of the warrants, a calculation is performed to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value, based upon the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to the outstanding warrants. The number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the warrants.\nAt 31 March 2025, the potentially dilutive ordinary shares were anti-dilutive because the Group was loss-making. The basic and diluted earnings per share as presented on the face of the income statement are therefore identical. All earnings per share figures presented above arise from continuing and total operations and, therefore, no earnings per share for discontinued operations is presented.\nIAS 33 requires presentation of diluted EPS when a company could be called upon to issue shares that would decrease earnings per share or increase the loss per share. For a loss-making company with outstanding share options, net loss per share would be decreased by the exercise of the options Therefore per IAS 33:36 the antidilutive potential ordinary shares are disregarded in the calculation of diluted EPS.\n7. Events after the reporting period\nSince the balance sheet date, the board has been focussed on completion of the RTO. The project is progressing, and funds are now being used on customary due diligence and legal processes. The Company's shares remain suspended from trading on AIM until 20th October 2025. Cash balances on 30 June 2025 were \u00a30.36m and the average monthly expenditure (excluding transaction costs) is approximately \u00a30.026m\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
