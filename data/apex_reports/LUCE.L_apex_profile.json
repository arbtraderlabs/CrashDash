This trading momentum has continued in the opening quarter of 2025 and we look forward to further growth this year - particularly with improving end-market dynamics. We have a strong and evolving product portfolio to meet the expected demand in our high growth target markets of Electric Vehicle charging and Home Energy Management system spaces.

We are pleased with the progress made to date to realise cost synergies from D-Line and with the early indications from CMD.\n\u00b7\nThe Group's balance sheet remains robust with Bank Net Debt at 1.7x EBITDA (within our target range of 1.0 - 2.0x) despite increased working capital requirements commensurate to the strong trading in Q4.\nCommenting on the trading update, Chief Executive Officer, John Hornby said:\n\"Luceco performed well in 2024, finishing the year strongly against the backdrop of a lacklustre macroeconomic environment in the UK. As a result, we anticipate reporting Adjusted Operating Profit ahead of market expectations. We look forward to further growth in 2025, hopeful of improved end-market demand, but confident that the Group is well positioned to make solid progress against its strategic objectives.\"\n*Company compiled analyst consensus as at 22 January 2025 is for full year 2024 revenue of \u00a3234.2m (Analyst Range of \u00a3232.8m - \u00a3234.6m) and Adjusted Operating Profit of \u00a326.5m (Analyst Range \u00a326.0m - \u00a327.2m)\nLuceco plc\nContact\nJohn Hornby, Chief Executive Officer\n07817 458804 (Via MHP)\nWill Hoy, Chief Financial Officer\nMHP\nContact\nTim Rowntree\nOllie Hoare\n07817 458804\nFor the purposes of MAR and Article 2 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/1055, this announcement is being made on behalf of Luceco plc by Will Hoy, Chief Financial Officer.\nNote to Editors\nLuceco plc - Bringing Power To Life\nLuceco plc (LSE:LUCE) is a supplier of wiring accessories, EV chargers, LED lighting, and portable power products.\nFor more information, please visit\nwww.lucecoplc.com\n.\nForward-looking statements\nThis announcement contains forward\n\u2011\nlooking statements that are subject to risk factors associated with, among other things, the economic and business circumstances occurring from time to time in the countries, sectors and markets in which the Group operates.

However, strong fourth quarter order book supports like-for-like revenue growth expectations for the second half.\n\u00b7\nEncouraging sales growth in the Group's Residential RMI related divisions (circa two thirds of Group sales). This more than compensates for the reduction in infrastructure revenue (c.15% of Group sales) reflecting its dependence on individual project timings.\n\u00b7\nOur Residential EV Charging business is growing strongly (up by 44% in Q3 year-on-year).\nM&A activity\n\u00b7\n\u00a330m acquisition of CMD announced on 30 September 2024, adding a market-leading designer and manufacturer of wiring accessories for the workplace. Its products include under-floor and under-desk power distribution solutions, on-desk and in-desk sockets, and a range of award-winning ergonomic products.\n\u00b7\nThe Group is pleased by the good progress towards unlocking the significant sourcing and other operational synergies which are a feature of the two acquisitions made during the year.\n\u00b7\nLuceco continues to review a healthy pipeline of M&A opportunities.\nBalance Sheet\n\u00b7\nBank Net Debt at the third quarter end of \u00a367.4m, giving a Bank Net Debt : EBITDA leverage ratio of 1.8x, comfortably within our target leverage range of 1-2x. Given the Group's excellent track record of strong cash generation, we expect to be towards the middle of this range by the end of 2025.\n\u00b7\nIn order to facilitate further investment in growth, the Group has recently exercised its option for its \u00a340m accordion facility to provide a total bank debt facility of \u00a3120m.\n\u00b7\nStrong balance sheet and cash flow generation provides optionality for further organic and M&A opportunities consistent with the Group's stated capital allocation objective.\nOutlook\n\u00b7\nThe Group's profit expectations remain in line with full year consensus*.\n\u00b7\nHealthy order book underpins our expectations for like-for-like revenue growth in the second half, and for full year total revenue growth to exceed 10%.\n\u00b7\nRecent growth in UK residential property transactions suggests improving residential RMI sentiment, giving us cause for optimism for 2025 and beyond.\n\u00b7\nContainer shipping costs have eased considerably during the quarter and are now close to historic norms.\n\u00b7\nWe are excited by the imminent launch of EV Chargers for Commercial Premises, as well as a Home Energy Management System for integrating Residential Batteries, EV Chargers, PV Solar Systems and Heating Controls.\n\u00b7\nWe are mindful of macroeconomic uncertainty but remain very confident in the Group's long term prospects.\nCommenting on trading, Chief Executive Officer, John Hornby said:\n\"Luceco continues to deliver growth despite a challenging market backdrop and we are excited by the recent acquisition of CMD, a market-leading manufacturer of wiring accessories for the workplace. Improving market sentiment underpins our belief that 2025 will see a return to more normalised growth in our markets. The Group's diverse portfolio and channels have contributed to the good trading performance in the year to date and our profit expectations for the full year remain unchanged.\"\n*consensus at 23rd October 2024, full year 2024 Adjusted Operating Profit \u00a326.5m (Analyst Range \u00a326.0m - \u00a327.2m)\nLuceco plc\nContact\nJohn Hornby, Chief Executive Officer\n(Via MHP)\nWill Hoy, Chief Financial Officer\n(Via MHP)\nMHP\nContact\nTim Rowntree\n07817 458804\nOllie Hoare\nFor the purposes of MAR and Article 2 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/1055, this announcement is being made on behalf of Luceco plc by Will Hoy, Chief Financial Officer.\nNote to Editors\nLuceco plc - Bringing Power To Life\nLuceco plc (LSE:LUCE) is a supplier of wiring accessories, EV chargers, LED lighting, and portable power products.\nFor more information, please visit\nwww.lucecoplc.com\n.\nForward-looking statements\nThis announcement contains forward\n\u2011\nlooking statements that are subject to risk factors associated with, among other things, the economic and business circumstances occurring from time to time in the countries, sectors and markets in which the Group operates.

Products include under-floor and under-desk power distribution solutions, on-desk and in-desk sockets, and a range of ergonomic products including the award-winning Miro monitor support arm. CMD has an experienced senior management team which will remain with the business, continuing to operate from its headquarters in Rotherham.\nFor the audited 12-month period ended 31 December 2023 CMD reported revenue of \u00a323.1m and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (\"\nEBITDA\n\") of \u00a34.0m. The Acquisition is expected to be earnings enhancing in its first full year of ownership.\nThe Consideration is subject to a closing cash, debt and working capital adjustment. The Consideration has been funded from Luceco's existing revolving credit facility, which has been expanded by \u00a340m via the accordion facility available under the terms of its syndicated bank facilities. The post-acquisition Bank Net Debt : EBITDA ratio is approximately 1.7x on a pro-forma (end August 2024) basis.\nJohn Hornby, Chief Executive Officer of Luceco commented:\n\"Luceco has a well-established position as a leading supplier of wiring accessories to the residential market in the UK so CMD, with its leading position in the commercial wiring accessories market, is a very natural fit. The Group's expertise in product development, manufacturing and sourcing will enable us to accelerate range innovation and improve margins for CMD. We also see an opportunity to offer Luceco's professional lighting range to CMD's customer base of specifiers and contractors. The acquisition is in line with our M&A strategy and follows the successful acquisition of D-Line earlier in the year.\n\"\nJon Holding, Managing Director of CMD commented:\n\"CMD has been successful over many years thanks to its hard-won reputation for consistently delivering excellent customer service.

This more than compensated for the 13% reduction in infrastructure revenue, which is circa 15% of Group sales and can be dependent on individual project timings\nOutlook\n\u00b7\nThe Group continues to perform in line with full year expectations*\n\u00b7\nWith UK interest rates easing we are hopeful that confidence in our sectors of the economy will begin to return, providing reasons to be more optimistic for 2025 and beyond\n\u00b7\nOur Residential EV Charging business is growing strongly and we are excited by the imminent launch of EV Chargers for Commercial Premises, as well as a Home Energy Management System for integrating Residential Batteries, EV Chargers, PV Solar Systems and Heating Controls\n\u00b7\nThe cost of container shipping remains high but has begun to ease recently\n\u00b7\nWe continue to explore M&A opportunities, in line with our capital allocation policy\nCommenting on the results, Chief Executive Officer, John Hornby said:\n\"These are strong results despite a challenging market backdrop. The Group's diverse portfolio and channels have ensured that we continue to grow and achieve a good financial performance, with adjusted operating profit up 17% in H1 2024. We are successfully integrating D-Line, which we acquired in February 2024 and we expect it to add circa \u00a315m of sales in 2024. The balance sheet remains strong with debt levels at the lower end of our target range, giving us flexibility to continue to invest in new organic and M&A opportunities in line with our capital allocation policy.\"\n*\nconsensus at 9 September 2024, full year 2024 Adjusted Operating Profit \u00a326.1m (Analyst Range \u00a325.5m - \u00a326.5m)\nResults information\nA meeting for analysts will be held at 9:30am BST today, Tuesday 10 September 2024 at the offices of Deutsche Numis, 45 Gresham Street, London EC2V 7BF.

Different brokers have access to different networks of investors or specialize in different sectors or geographies. By appointing two brokers, Luceco can expand its reach to a wider pool of investors, both retail and institutional. Brokers often specialize in particular industries and multiple brokers can improve the quality and frequency of investor interaction. Joint brokers also enhances the liquidity of a Luceco shares by stimulating trading activity. Each broker can work independently to attract buyers and sellers, increasing the overall market activity for the stock. The presence of two brokers increases competition, encouraging them to perform better in securing new investors, increasing share liquidity, or achieving higher valuations. It also signals strong institutional backing and a proactive approach to corporate governance. All in all, very happy here, should now see sustained rise.",

I've never bought at the exact bottom or held long enough to get anywhere near the peak but taking a reasonable profit is better than sitting on a loss.  Everything looks good in the short term and the current share price is higher than what Blackrock and the directors paid in the last few months.  LUCE still looks like good value now and I wouldn't be surprised if it continues rising to around 200p by May. Share price volatility is a problem though - LUCE almost hit 500p in August 2021.  It is currently under a third of the peak price right now.  What drove the price up in 2021?  I wasn't following LUCE at that time, as I sold out at below 200p in 2020 and took what I thought was a good profit at the time, but the price kept rising and I didn't get a chance to buy in again at 200p or below.",

Analyst Edward Prest started coverage with a \u2018buy\u2019 recommendation and target price of 160p on the lighting manufacturer and supplier, which was trading up 0.8% on Wednesday afternoon at 128p but is still down nearly 15% over the past year. Prest was impressed by the fact the group has its own manufacturing operations in China which \u2018gives it full control of its supply chain\u2019. He also highlighted a \u2018strong track record in product development, and its proven ability to innovate in a dynamic consumer and regulatory environment\u2019, as well as a \u2018strong balance sheet and cash generation capability\u2019, the latter of which provides scope for both M&A and investment. \u2018Recent years have been tough for [the repair, maintenance and improvement] markets, and the second half 2025 outlook is certainly more one of stability around trough levels than a sharp bounce back,\u2019 said Prest. \u2018The group has managed the headwinds well and fared better than various peers.\u2019 Agree with this above. Think it will be a slow burner however. I am calling the bottom as 125p. So more to come in sunnier times.",

You'd think LUCE wasn't doing well at the current price - down over 10% in 1 month and 20% in 1 year.

Its very tiresome, but also a great chance to load up. If the debt was lower on the balance sheet, I think there would be more chance of a take over. The interims were good, but we need to see Q3 update to really see what's happening. If there is a seller (lets say a fund is a forced seller) then Saba will just keep dropping the bid as there are no other buyers. There could be 1M shares to sell, which is about what they need from memory. Dont take the short personally or aimed at the company, its just money exiting the uk market, and Saba got there first. I am also holding PVR, which is another Saba short, a rival has increased up to 21% of the company, and still they are not trying to close. The Saba business model probably includes pushing your luck a bit, as you can afford the consequences if it goes wrong. Whole market is very tiresome right now... My strategy here would be to keep adding small amounts at good prices. Hopefully once the debt is reduced, they can either run a buy back or get a bid.",

They have a lot of contracts with schools - over the holidays they refit the whole lighting system over to LED at no upfront cost. If the electricity saving is c50% the school 'pays' maybe 20% a year to cover the cost, so still makes say 30% annual saving in total.",

Different brokers have access to different networks of investors or specialize in different sectors or geographies. By appointing two brokers, Luceco can expand its reach to a wider pool of investors, both retail and institutional. Brokers often specialize in particular industries and multiple brokers can improve the quality and frequency of investor interaction. Joint brokers also enhances the liquidity of a Luceco shares by stimulating trading activity. Each broker can work independently to attract buyers and sellers, increasing the overall market activity for the stock. The presence of two brokers increases competition, encouraging them to perform better in securing new investors, increasing share liquidity, or achieving higher valuations. It also signals strong institutional backing and a proactive approach to corporate governance. All in all, very happy here, should now see sustained rise.",

May get a TR1 RNS tomorrow if executed by Blackrock or another II. I've bought and sold LUCE a few times and always made money.  I've never bought at the exact bottom or held long enough to get anywhere near the peak but taking a reasonable profit is better than sitting on a loss.  Everything looks good in the short term and the current share price is higher than what Blackrock and the directors paid in the last few months.  LUCE still looks like good value now and I wouldn't be surprised if it continues rising to around 200p by May. Share price volatility is a problem though - LUCE almost hit 500p in August 2021.  It is currently under a third of the peak price right now.  What drove the price up in 2021?  I wasn't following LUCE at that time, as I sold out at below 200p in 2020 and took what I thought was a good profit at the time, but the price kept rising and I didn't get a chance to buy in again at 200p or below.",

Analyst Edward Prest started coverage with a \u2018buy\u2019 recommendation and target price of 160p on the lighting manufacturer and supplier, which was trading up 0.8% on Wednesday afternoon at 128p but is still down nearly 15% over the past year. Prest was impressed by the fact the group has its own manufacturing operations in China which \u2018gives it full control of its supply chain\u2019. He also highlighted a \u2018strong track record in product development, and its proven ability to innovate in a dynamic consumer and regulatory environment\u2019, as well as a \u2018strong balance sheet and cash generation capability\u2019, the latter of which provides scope for both M&A and investment. \u2018Recent years have been tough for [the repair, maintenance and improvement] markets, and the second half 2025 outlook is certainly more one of stability around trough levels than a sharp bounce back,\u2019 said Prest. \u2018The group has managed the headwinds well and fared better than various peers.\u2019 Agree with this above. Think it will be a slow burner however. I am calling the bottom as 125p. So more to come in sunnier times.",

Its very tiresome, but also a great chance to load up. If the debt was lower on the balance sheet, I think there would be more chance of a take over. The interims were good, but we need to see Q3 update to really see what's happening. If there is a seller (lets say a fund is a forced seller) then Saba will just keep dropping the bid as there are no other buyers. There could be 1M shares to sell, which is about what they need from memory. Dont take the short personally or aimed at the company, its just money exiting the uk market, and Saba got there first. I am also holding PVR, which is another Saba short, a rival has increased up to 21% of the company, and still they are not trying to close. The Saba business model probably includes pushing your luck a bit, as you can afford the consequences if it goes wrong. Whole market is very tiresome right now... My strategy here would be to keep adding small amounts at good prices. Hopefully once the debt is reduced, they can either run a buy back or get a bid.",

LUCE is still a supplier of lighting products to eEnergy.  This has raised around \u00a32M in cash.  Perhaps LUCE are getting some money together to make an acquisition? The LUCE share price has gradually moved up to 135p over the week on low volumes.  The weird thing is the amount of sold value shown on LSE has been wrong for the past few days.  They seem to be adding around \u00a360K onto the sold value each day for some reason. Friday figures: Vol. Sold\t        11,960, Sold Value\t        \u00a379.43k Vol. Bought\t18,218, Bought Value\t\u00a330.28k If people just glance at the \u00a3 values it appears there are more sells than buys BUT only 11960 sells (roughly \u00a316K) and 18218 buys (roughly \u00a325K).  The bought value is slightly high too, but not as far out as the sells.  \u00a330.28k for 18,218 shares works out at 166p per share!  What is going on here?",

The interims were good, but we need to see Q3 update to really see what's happening. If there is a seller (lets say a fund is a forced seller) then Saba will just keep dropping the bid as there are no other buyers. There could be 1M shares to sell, which is about what they need from memory. Dont take the short personally or aimed at the company, its just money exiting the uk market, and Saba got there first. I am also holding PVR, which is another Saba short, a rival has increased up to 21% of the company, and still they are not trying to close. The Saba business model probably includes pushing your luck a bit, as you can afford the consequences if it goes wrong. Whole market is very tiresome right now... My strategy here would be to keep adding small amounts at good prices. Hopefully once the debt is reduced, they can either run a buy back or get a bid.",

They have a lot of contracts with schools - over the holidays they refit the whole lighting system over to LED at no upfront cost. If the electricity saving is c50% the school 'pays' maybe 20% a year to cover the cost, so still makes say 30% annual saving in total.",

Different brokers have access to different networks of investors or specialize in different sectors or geographies. By appointing two brokers, Luceco can expand its reach to a wider pool of investors, both retail and institutional. Brokers often specialize in particular industries and multiple brokers can improve the quality and frequency of investor interaction. Joint brokers also enhances the liquidity of a Luceco shares by stimulating trading activity. Each broker can work independently to attract buyers and sellers, increasing the overall market activity for the stock. The presence of two brokers increases competition, encouraging them to perform better in securing new investors, increasing share liquidity, or achieving higher valuations. It also signals strong institutional backing and a proactive approach to corporate governance. All in all, very happy here, should now see sustained rise.",

I've never bought at the exact bottom or held long enough to get anywhere near the peak but taking a reasonable profit is better than sitting on a loss.  Everything looks good in the short term and the current share price is higher than what Blackrock and the directors paid in the last few months.  LUCE still looks like good value now and I wouldn't be surprised if it continues rising to around 200p by May. Share price volatility is a problem though - LUCE almost hit 500p in August 2021.  It is currently under a third of the peak price right now.  What drove the price up in 2021?  I wasn't following LUCE at that time, as I sold out at below 200p in 2020 and took what I thought was a good profit at the time, but the price kept rising and I didn't get a chance to buy in again at 200p or below.",

Also LUCE sold their 9.1% stake in the eEnergy Group, which they had held for around 2 years.  All of their shares were sold to Harwood Capital LLP.  LUCE is still a supplier of lighting products to eEnergy.  This has raised around \u00a32M in cash.  Perhaps LUCE are getting some money together to make an acquisition? The LUCE share price has gradually moved up to 135p over the week on low volumes.  The weird thing is the amount of sold value shown on LSE has been wrong for the past few days.  They seem to be adding around \u00a360K onto the sold value each day for some reason.

There is a short here that needs to be closed from Saba, plus Blackrock are up to some tricks - see TR1.

Its very tiresome, but also a great chance to load up. If the debt was lower on the balance sheet, I think there would be more chance of a take over. The interims were good, but we need to see Q3 update to really see what's happening. If there is a seller (lets say a fund is a forced seller) then Saba will just keep dropping the bid as there are no other buyers. There could be 1M shares to sell, which is about what they need from memory. Dont take the short personally or aimed at the company, its just money exiting the uk market, and Saba got there first. I am also holding PVR, which is another Saba short, a rival has increased up to 21% of the company, and still they are not trying to close. The Saba business model probably includes pushing your luck a bit, as you can afford the consequences if it goes wrong. Whole market is very tiresome right now... My strategy here would be to keep adding small amounts at good prices. Hopefully once the debt is reduced, they can either run a buy back or get a bid.",

The negative is the percentage of shorters has increased to the highest level in the last few years.  Let's hope they have got things wrong and lose some money! You'd think LUCE wasn't doing well at the current price - down over 10% in 1 month and 20% in 1 year.  Their sales are up year on year and have diversified into the vehicle charging market which should further increase future sales.",

Analyst Edward Prest started coverage with a \u2018buy\u2019 recommendation and target price of 160p on the lighting manufacturer and supplier, which was trading up 0.8% on Wednesday afternoon at 128p but is still down nearly 15% over the past year. Prest was impressed by the fact the group has its own manufacturing operations in China which \u2018gives it full control of its supply chain\u2019. He also highlighted a \u2018strong track record in product development, and its proven ability to innovate in a dynamic consumer and regulatory environment\u2019, as well as a \u2018strong balance sheet and cash generation capability\u2019, the latter of which provides scope for both M&A and investment. \u2018Recent years have been tough for [the repair, maintenance and improvement] markets, and the second half 2025 outlook is certainly more one of stability around trough levels than a sharp bounce back,\u2019 said Prest. \u2018The group has managed the headwinds well and fared better than various peers.\u2019 Agree with this above. Think it will be a slow burner however. I am calling the bottom as 125p. So more to come in sunnier times.",

May get a TR1 RNS tomorrow if executed by Blackrock or another II. I've bought and sold LUCE a few times and always made money.  I've never bought at the exact bottom or held long enough to get anywhere near the peak but taking a reasonable profit is better than sitting on a loss.  Everything looks good in the short term and the current share price is higher than what Blackrock and the directors paid in the last few months.  LUCE still looks like good value now and I wouldn't be surprised if it continues rising to around 200p by May. Share price volatility is a problem though - LUCE almost hit 500p in August 2021.  It is currently under a third of the peak price right now.  What drove the price up in 2021?  I wasn't following LUCE at that time, as I sold out at below 200p in 2020 and took what I thought was a good profit at the time, but the price kept rising and I didn't get a chance to buy in again at 200p or below.",

Also LUCE sold their 9.1% stake in the eEnergy Group, which they had held for around 2 years.  All of their shares were sold to Harwood Capital LLP.  LUCE is still a supplier of lighting products to eEnergy.  This has raised around \u00a32M in cash.  Perhaps LUCE are getting some money together to make an acquisition? The LUCE share price has gradually moved up to 135p over the week on low volumes.  The weird thing is the amount of sold value shown on LSE has been wrong for the past few days.  They seem to be adding around \u00a360K onto the sold value each day for some reason. Friday figures: Vol. Sold\t        11,960, Sold Value\t        \u00a379.43k Vol. Bought\t18,218, Bought Value\t\u00a330.28k If people just glance at the \u00a3 values it appears there are more sells than buys BUT only 11960 sells (roughly \u00a316K) and 18218 buys (roughly \u00a325K).  The bought value is slightly high too, but not as far out as the sells.  \u00a330.28k for 18,218 shares works out at 166p per share!  What is going on here?",

The interims were good, but we need to see Q3 update to really see what's happening. If there is a seller (lets say a fund is a forced seller) then Saba will just keep dropping the bid as there are no other buyers. There could be 1M shares to sell, which is about what they need from memory. Dont take the short personally or aimed at the company, its just money exiting the uk market, and Saba got there first. I am also holding PVR, which is another Saba short, a rival has increased up to 21% of the company, and still they are not trying to close. The Saba business model probably includes pushing your luck a bit, as you can afford the consequences if it goes wrong. Whole market is very tiresome right now... My strategy here would be to keep adding small amounts at good prices. Hopefully once the debt is reduced, they can either run a buy back or get a bid.",

Analyst Edward Prest started coverage with a \u2018buy\u2019 recommendation and target price of 160p on the lighting manufacturer and supplier, which was trading up 0.8% on Wednesday afternoon at 128p but is still down nearly 15% over the past year. Prest was impressed by the fact the group has its own manufacturing operations in China which \u2018gives it full control of its supply chain\u2019. He also highlighted a \u2018strong track record in product development, and its proven ability to innovate in a dynamic consumer and regulatory environment\u2019, as well as a \u2018strong balance sheet and cash generation capability\u2019, the latter of which provides scope for both M&A and investment. \u2018Recent years have been tough for [the repair, maintenance and improvement] markets, and the second half 2025 outlook is certainly more one of stability around trough levels than a sharp bounce back,\u2019 said Prest. \u2018The group has managed the headwinds well and fared better than various peers.\u2019 Agree with this above. Think it will be a slow burner however. I am calling the bottom as 125p. So more to come in sunnier times.",

I've never bought at the exact bottom or held long enough to get anywhere near the peak but taking a reasonable profit is better than sitting on a loss.  Everything looks good in the short term and the current share price is higher than what Blackrock and the directors paid in the last few months.  LUCE still looks like good value now and I wouldn't be surprised if it continues rising to around 200p by May. Share price volatility is a problem though - LUCE almost hit 500p in August 2021.  It is currently under a third of the peak price right now.  What drove the price up in 2021?  I wasn't following LUCE at that time, as I sold out at below 200p in 2020 and took what I thought was a good profit at the time, but the price kept rising and I didn't get a chance to buy in again at 200p or below.",

LUCE is still a supplier of lighting products to eEnergy.  This has raised around \u00a32M in cash.  Perhaps LUCE are getting some money together to make an acquisition? The LUCE share price has gradually moved up to 135p over the week on low volumes.  The weird thing is the amount of sold value shown on LSE has been wrong for the past few days.  They seem to be adding around \u00a360K onto the sold value each day for some reason. Friday figures: Vol. Sold\t        11,960, Sold Value\t        \u00a379.43k Vol. Bought\t18,218, Bought Value\t\u00a330.28k If people just glance at the \u00a3 values it appears there are more sells than buys BUT only 11960 sells (roughly \u00a316K) and 18218 buys (roughly \u00a325K).

Management guidance and call commentary paint a picture of accelerating low-carbon sales and concrete channel wins, while acknowledging near-term cash strain driven by investment and M&A. - Sync EV revenue guidance: Management commentary (Analyst call): Sync EV expected to turn over ~\u00a318m in 2025. - Hive channel win: Management commentary (Analyst call): Sync EV awarded to sell chargers into Hive\u2019s ecosystem, with expected c. \u00a32\u20133m sales in 2026 tied to this integration. - Market share claim: Management commentary (Analyst call): Luceco reports ~8% share of new-install cloud-connected residential vehicle charging in the UK - Product launches & IP: Management referenced a recent product launch and patent activity (Linc patent referenced on the call) supporting product differentiation. - Manufacturing / margin advantage: Manufacturing of Sync EV chargers occurs in Luceco\u2019s own factory in China (built c.2007/2008), enabling better margin control vs competitors reliant on outsourced supply. - Low-carbon progress: Management reiterated \u00a383m revenue from low-carbon product categories in 2024, and \u00a342m in H1 2025 \u2014 demonstrating rapid first-half momentum. - M&A capacity: Management signalled long-term M&A firepower, noting commentary that the group could spend up to \u00a3100m on M&A by 2030, focused on energy transition and distribution expansion. - D-Line: Management expects D-Line profitability to double within two years post-acquisition through integration and cost optimisation. - CMD: Management identifies cost savings and synergies expected from CMD integration - explicit synergy targets discussed on the call. - Tariffs & manufacturing shifts: Management discussed tariff weakness in Mexico affecting factory; also explained selective moves from China to Vietnam to reduce tariff exposure and preserve margin. - Bull case: Sync EV growth (\u00a318m 2025 ramp + Hive channel), accelerating low-carbon revenue (H1 traction), and M&A-led margin upside (D-Line, CMD) could materially re-rate the business as a consolidated energy-transition supplier. -Founder still owns 18%. Founder from M&A background. - Upside from short positions to close",

Its very tiresome, but also a great chance to load up. If the debt was lower on the balance sheet, I think there would be more chance of a take over. The interims were good, but we need to see Q3 update to really see what's happening. If there is a seller (lets say a fund is a forced seller) then Saba will just keep dropping the bid as there are no other buyers. There could be 1M shares to sell, which is about what they need from memory. Dont take the short personally or aimed at the company, its just money exiting the uk market, and Saba got there first. I am also holding PVR, which is another Saba short, a rival has increased up to 21% of the company, and still they are not trying to close. The Saba business model probably includes pushing your luck a bit, as you can afford the consequences if it goes wrong. Whole market is very tiresome right now... My strategy here would be to keep adding small amounts at good prices. Hopefully once the debt is reduced, they can either run a buy back or get a bid.",

Analyst Edward Prest started coverage with a \u2018buy\u2019 recommendation and target price of 160p on the lighting manufacturer and supplier, which was trading up 0.8% on Wednesday afternoon at 128p but is still down nearly 15% over the past year. Prest was impressed by the fact the group has its own manufacturing operations in China which \u2018gives it full control of its supply chain\u2019. He also highlighted a \u2018strong track record in product development, and its proven ability to innovate in a dynamic consumer and regulatory environment\u2019, as well as a \u2018strong balance sheet and cash generation capability\u2019, the latter of which provides scope for both M&A and investment. \u2018Recent years have been tough for [the repair, maintenance and improvement] markets, and the second half 2025 outlook is certainly more one of stability around trough levels than a sharp bounce back,\u2019 said Prest. \u2018The group has managed the headwinds well and fared better than various peers.\u2019 Agree with this above. Think it will be a slow burner however. I am calling the bottom as 125p. So more to come in sunnier times.",

May get a TR1 RNS tomorrow if executed by Blackrock or another II. I've bought and sold LUCE a few times and always made money.  I've never bought at the exact bottom or held long enough to get anywhere near the peak but taking a reasonable profit is better than sitting on a loss.  Everything looks good in the short term and the current share price is higher than what Blackrock and the directors paid in the last few months.  LUCE still looks like good value now and I wouldn't be surprised if it continues rising to around 200p by May. Share price volatility is a problem though - LUCE almost hit 500p in August 2021.  It is currently under a third of the peak price right now.  What drove the price up in 2021?  I wasn't following LUCE at that time, as I sold out at below 200p in 2020 and took what I thought was a good profit at the time, but the price kept rising and I didn't get a chance to buy in again at 200p or below.",

Its very tiresome, but also a great chance to load up. If the debt was lower on the balance sheet, I think there would be more chance of a take over. The interims were good, but we need to see Q3 update to really see what's happening. If there is a seller (lets say a fund is a forced seller) then Saba will just keep dropping the bid as there are no other buyers. There could be 1M shares to sell, which is about what they need from memory. Dont take the short personally or aimed at the company, its just money exiting the uk market, and Saba got there first. I am also holding PVR, which is another Saba short, a rival has increased up to 21% of the company, and still they are not trying to close. The Saba business model probably includes pushing your luck a bit, as you can afford the consequences if it goes wrong. Whole market is very tiresome right now... My strategy here would be to keep adding small amounts at good prices. Hopefully once the debt is reduced, they can either run a buy back or get a bid.",

But not putting more money in risks me missing the upturn whenever it comes. The SP trajectory makes me think there is a fundamental issue with the share. One which I am just not seeing!",

Analyst Edward Prest started coverage with a \u2018buy\u2019 recommendation and target price of 160p on the lighting manufacturer and supplier, which was trading up 0.8% on Wednesday afternoon at 128p but is still down nearly 15% over the past year. Prest was impressed by the fact the group has its own manufacturing operations in China which \u2018gives it full control of its supply chain\u2019. He also highlighted a \u2018strong track record in product development, and its proven ability to innovate in a dynamic consumer and regulatory environment\u2019, as well as a \u2018strong balance sheet and cash generation capability\u2019, the latter of which provides scope for both M&A and investment. \u2018Recent years have been tough for [the repair, maintenance and improvement] markets, and the second half 2025 outlook is certainly more one of stability around trough levels than a sharp bounce back,\u2019 said Prest. \u2018The group has managed the headwinds well and fared better than various peers.\u2019 Agree with this above. Think it will be a slow burner however. I am calling the bottom as 125p. So more to come in sunnier times.",

I've never bought at the exact bottom or held long enough to get anywhere near the peak but taking a reasonable profit is better than sitting on a loss.  Everything looks good in the short term and the current share price is higher than what Blackrock and the directors paid in the last few months.  LUCE still looks like good value now and I wouldn't be surprised if it continues rising to around 200p by May. Share price volatility is a problem though - LUCE almost hit 500p in August 2021.  It is currently under a third of the peak price right now.  What drove the price up in 2021?  I wasn't following LUCE at that time, as I sold out at below 200p in 2020 and took what I thought was a good profit at the time, but the price kept rising and I didn't get a chance to buy in again at 200p or below.",

LUCE is still a supplier of lighting products to eEnergy.  This has raised around \u00a32M in cash.  Perhaps LUCE are getting some money together to make an acquisition? The LUCE share price has gradually moved up to 135p over the week on low volumes.  The weird thing is the amount of sold value shown on LSE has been wrong for the past few days.  They seem to be adding around \u00a360K onto the sold value each day for some reason.

Management guidance and call commentary paint a picture of accelerating low-carbon sales and concrete channel wins, while acknowledging near-term cash strain driven by investment and M&A. - Sync EV revenue guidance: Management commentary (Analyst call): Sync EV expected to turn over ~\u00a318m in 2025. - Hive channel win: Management commentary (Analyst call): Sync EV awarded to sell chargers into Hive\u2019s ecosystem, with expected c. \u00a32\u20133m sales in 2026 tied to this integration. - Market share claim: Management commentary (Analyst call): Luceco reports ~8% share of new-install cloud-connected residential vehicle charging in the UK - Product launches & IP: Management referenced a recent product launch and patent activity (Linc patent referenced on the call) supporting product differentiation. - Manufacturing / margin advantage: Manufacturing of Sync EV chargers occurs in Luceco\u2019s own factory in China (built c.2007/2008), enabling better margin control vs competitors reliant on outsourced supply. - Low-carbon progress: Management reiterated \u00a383m revenue from low-carbon product categories in 2024, and \u00a342m in H1 2025 \u2014 demonstrating rapid first-half momentum. - M&A capacity: Management signalled long-term M&A firepower, noting commentary that the group could spend up to \u00a3100m on M&A by 2030, focused on energy transition and distribution expansion. - D-Line: Management expects D-Line profitability to double within two years post-acquisition through integration and cost optimisation. - CMD: Management identifies cost savings and synergies expected from CMD integration - explicit synergy targets discussed on the call. - Tariffs & manufacturing shifts: Management discussed tariff weakness in Mexico affecting factory; also explained selective moves from China to Vietnam to reduce tariff exposure and preserve margin. - Bull case: Sync EV growth (\u00a318m 2025 ramp + Hive channel), accelerating low-carbon revenue (H1 traction), and M&A-led margin upside (D-Line, CMD) could materially re-rate the business as a consolidated energy-transition supplier. -Founder still owns 18%. Founder from M&A background. - Upside from short positions to close",

Its very tiresome, but also a great chance to load up. If the debt was lower on the balance sheet, I think there would be more chance of a take over. The interims were good, but we need to see Q3 update to really see what's happening. If there is a seller (lets say a fund is a forced seller) then Saba will just keep dropping the bid as there are no other buyers. There could be 1M shares to sell, which is about what they need from memory. Dont take the short personally or aimed at the company, its just money exiting the uk market, and Saba got there first. I am also holding PVR, which is another Saba short, a rival has increased up to 21% of the company, and still they are not trying to close. The Saba business model probably includes pushing your luck a bit, as you can afford the consequences if it goes wrong. Whole market is very tiresome right now... My strategy here would be to keep adding small amounts at good prices. Hopefully once the debt is reduced, they can either run a buy back or get a bid.",

Analyst Edward Prest started coverage with a \u2018buy\u2019 recommendation and target price of 160p on the lighting manufacturer and supplier, which was trading up 0.8% on Wednesday afternoon at 128p but is still down nearly 15% over the past year. Prest was impressed by the fact the group has its own manufacturing operations in China which \u2018gives it full control of its supply chain\u2019. He also highlighted a \u2018strong track record in product development, and its proven ability to innovate in a dynamic consumer and regulatory environment\u2019, as well as a \u2018strong balance sheet and cash generation capability\u2019, the latter of which provides scope for both M&A and investment. \u2018Recent years have been tough for [the repair, maintenance and improvement] markets, and the second half 2025 outlook is certainly more one of stability around trough levels than a sharp bounce back,\u2019 said Prest. \u2018The group has managed the headwinds well and fared better than various peers.\u2019 Agree with this above. Think it will be a slow burner however. I am calling the bottom as 125p. So more to come in sunnier times.",

May get a TR1 RNS tomorrow if executed by Blackrock or another II. I've bought and sold LUCE a few times and always made money.  I've never bought at the exact bottom or held long enough to get anywhere near the peak but taking a reasonable profit is better than sitting on a loss.  Everything looks good in the short term and the current share price is higher than what Blackrock and the directors paid in the last few months.  LUCE still looks like good value now and I wouldn't be surprised if it continues rising to around 200p by May. Share price volatility is a problem though - LUCE almost hit 500p in August 2021.  It is currently under a third of the peak price right now.  What drove the price up in 2021?  I wasn't following LUCE at that time, as I sold out at below 200p in 2020 and took what I thought was a good profit at the time, but the price kept rising and I didn't get a chance to buy in again at 200p or below.",

Its very tiresome, but also a great chance to load up. If the debt was lower on the balance sheet, I think there would be more chance of a take over. The interims were good, but we need to see Q3 update to really see what's happening. If there is a seller (lets say a fund is a forced seller) then Saba will just keep dropping the bid as there are no other buyers. There could be 1M shares to sell, which is about what they need from memory. Dont take the short personally or aimed at the company, its just money exiting the uk market, and Saba got there first. I am also holding PVR, which is another Saba short, a rival has increased up to 21% of the company, and still they are not trying to close. The Saba business model probably includes pushing your luck a bit, as you can afford the consequences if it goes wrong. Whole market is very tiresome right now... My strategy here would be to keep adding small amounts at good prices. Hopefully once the debt is reduced, they can either run a buy back or get a bid.",

The business is well grounded, and is well out of neutral in the present phase, as the success re-fuses to be met with resistance. Things looking positive and highly charged for watts to come.",

Analyst Edward Prest started coverage with a \u2018buy\u2019 recommendation and target price of 160p on the lighting manufacturer and supplier, which was trading up 0.8% on Wednesday afternoon at 128p but is still down nearly 15% over the past year. Prest was impressed by the fact the group has its own manufacturing operations in China which \u2018gives it full control of its supply chain\u2019. He also highlighted a \u2018strong track record in product development, and its proven ability to innovate in a dynamic consumer and regulatory environment\u2019, as well as a \u2018strong balance sheet and cash generation capability\u2019, the latter of which provides scope for both M&A and investment. \u2018Recent years have been tough for [the repair, maintenance and improvement] markets, and the second half 2025 outlook is certainly more one of stability around trough levels than a sharp bounce back,\u2019 said Prest. \u2018The group has managed the headwinds well and fared better than various peers.\u2019 Agree with this above. Think it will be a slow burner however. I am calling the bottom as 125p. So more to come in sunnier times.",

I've never bought at the exact bottom or held long enough to get anywhere near the peak but taking a reasonable profit is better than sitting on a loss.  Everything looks good in the short term and the current share price is higher than what Blackrock and the directors paid in the last few months.  LUCE still looks like good value now and I wouldn't be surprised if it continues rising to around 200p by May. Share price volatility is a problem though - LUCE almost hit 500p in August 2021.  It is currently under a third of the peak price right now.  What drove the price up in 2021?  I wasn't following LUCE at that time, as I sold out at below 200p in 2020 and took what I thought was a good profit at the time, but the price kept rising and I didn't get a chance to buy in again at 200p or below.",

Also LUCE sold their 9.1% stake in the eEnergy Group, which they had held for around 2 years.  All of their shares were sold to Harwood Capital LLP.  LUCE is still a supplier of lighting products to eEnergy.  This has raised around \u00a32M in cash.  Perhaps LUCE are getting some money together to make an acquisition? The LUCE share price has gradually moved up to 135p over the week on low volumes.  The weird thing is the amount of sold value shown on LSE has been wrong for the past few days.  They seem to be adding around \u00a360K onto the sold value each day for some reason. Friday figures: Vol. Sold\t        11,960, Sold Value\t        \u00a379.43k Vol. Bought\t18,218, Bought Value\t\u00a330.28k If people just glance at the \u00a3 values it appears there are more sells than buys BUT only 11960 sells (roughly \u00a316K) and 18218 buys (roughly \u00a325K).

IMO, this is a classic shake out, there is no volume on these red days. LUCE is already cheap at 6.2 Ev/EBit (if FY results come in). There is a short here that needs to be closed from Saba, plus Blackrock are up to some tricks - see TR1. I increased my holding in my pension recently, its one of my largest small caps now, I chose to do this to back the CEO, and strategy of the business.

Its very tiresome, but also a great chance to load up. If the debt was lower on the balance sheet, I think there would be more chance of a take over. The interims were good, but we need to see Q3 update to really see what's happening. If there is a seller (lets say a fund is a forced seller) then Saba will just keep dropping the bid as there are no other buyers. There could be 1M shares to sell, which is about what they need from memory. Dont take the short personally or aimed at the company, its just money exiting the uk market, and Saba got there first. I am also holding PVR, which is another Saba short, a rival has increased up to 21% of the company, and still they are not trying to close. The Saba business model probably includes pushing your luck a bit, as you can afford the consequences if it goes wrong. Whole market is very tiresome right now... My strategy here would be to keep adding small amounts at good prices. Hopefully once the debt is reduced, they can either run a buy back or get a bid.",
