Revenue for the period was \u00a317,798 and cost of sales was \u00a3nil giving a gross profit for the period of \u00a317,798.\nMortgage and private loan interest was paid during the period of \u00a332,726 with a further \u00a342,768 of loan note equity interest being accrued in the period. The result of the above is a loss before taxation for the period of \u00a3441,137.\nReflecting on the issues of the previous two years in the economy and the challenges businesses and consumers have faced, the directors have considered relevant information including the current cost-of-living crisis, higher interest rates and even higher inflation, which are driving a challenging market and have performed a robust analysis of future cash flows.\nBased on their assessments and having regard to resources available to the entity, the directors have concluded that they can continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.\nA summary of activities in the 6 months to 30 September 2022 for the Group are as follows:\n-\nTrafalgar New Homes secured funding from Lloyds Bank plc in May 2022 of \u00a3387,600 to purchase a development site in Speldhurst which completed in July 2022. This is a single site with full planning for a single detached house and we are currently awaiting building regulation approval prior to appointment of a contractor.\n-\nRetirement+ has recently been granted planning permission on a site in Leatherhead where we hold an option to acquire the site. Work is now underway to assess the viability of carrying out the development, given the increases in costs the market is experiencing, or to onward sell the site as is with planning permission.\n-\nSelmat sold one of its investment properties at Burnside in May 2022 for \u00a3337,000 and are continuing to actively market its remaining property although Flat 2 is under offer at \u00a3325,000 with the survey and mortgage valuation already having been carried out. In addition, an offer has been accepted in principle on Orchard House for \u00a31,050,000 but the prospective buyer has yet to sell their property.\nFollowing the period end, November 2022, the company acquired a hydroponic research and development facility as part of its long term plan to facilitate its hydroponics strategy.\nPaul Treadaway\nChief Executive\nTRAFALGAR PROPERTY GROUP PLC\nCONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED INTERIM RESULTS FOR THE\nSIX MONTHS ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2022\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n6 month\nperiod ended\n30 September\n(Unaudited)\n6 month\nperiod ended\n30 September\n(Unaudited)\nYear\nended\n31 March\n(Audited)\nNote\n2022\n2021\n2022\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nRevenue\n18\n390\n65\nCost of sales\n(-)\n(383)\n(3)\nGross profit\n18\n7\n62\n(Loss) on disposal of investment property\n(6)\n-\n(28)\nAdministrative expenses\n(380)\n(257)\n(460)\nUnderlying operating (loss)\n(368)\n(250)\n(426)\nFair value movement on investment property valuation\n-\n-\n112\nInterest payable and similar charges\n(76)\n(88)\n(172)\n(Loss) before taxation\n(444)\n(338)\n(486)\nTax payable on profit on ordinary activities\n4\n-\n-\n-\n(Loss) after taxation for the period\n(444)\n(338)\n(486)\nOther comprehensive income\nTotal comprehensive (loss) for the period\n(444)\n(338)\n(486)\n(Loss) attributable to:\nEquity holders of the parent\n(444)\n(338)\n(486)\nTotal comprehensive (loss) for the period attributable to:\nEquity holders of the parent\n(444)\n(338)\n(486)\n(LOSS) PER ORDINARY SHARE;\nBasic/Diluted\n5\n(0.20)p\n(0.35)p\n(0.34)p\nAll results in the current and preceding financial period derive from continuing operations.\nTRAFALGAR PROPERTY GROUP PLC\nCONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED INTERIM RESULTS FOR THE\nSIX MONTHS ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2022\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\n30 September\n(Unaudited)\n30 September\n(Unaudited)\n31 March\n(Audited)\nNote\n2022\n2021\n2022\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nNon-current assets\nTangible fixed assets\n1\n1\n1\nInvestment property\n9\n-\n1,533\n-\n1\n1,534\n1\nCurrent assets\nInventory\n339\n87\n26\nTrade and other receivables\n54\n14\n40\nInvestment properties\n10\n1,375\n-\n1,712\nCash at bank and in hand\n153\n24\n13\n1,921\n125\n1,791\nTotal assets\n1,922\n1,659\n1,792\nEQUITIES AND LIABILITIES\nCurrent liabilities\nTrade and other payables\n468\n470\n370\nBorrowings\n760\n-\n870\n1,228\n470\n1,240\nNon-current liabilities\nBorrowings\n3,886\n4,490\n3,825\nTotal liabilities\n5,114\n4,960\n5,065\nEquity attributable to equity holders of the Company\nCalled up share capital\n6 & 7\n2,860\n2,727\n2,727\nShare premium account\n3,485\n3,250\n3,250\nLoan note equity\n6 & 7\n145\n104\n30\nReverse acquisition reserve\n(2,818)\n(2,818)\n(2,818)\nCapital contribution reserve\n8\n158\n-\n158\nProfit and loss account\n(7,022)\n(6,564)\n(6,620)\nTotal Equity\n(3,192)\n(3,301)\n(3,273)\nTotal Equity and Liabilities\n1,922\n1,659\n1,792\nTRAFALGAR PROPERTY GROUP PLC\nCONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED INTERIM RESULTS FOR THE\nSIX MONTHS ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2022\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nShare capital\nShare premium\nLoan\nNote equity\nReserve\nReverse acquisition reserve\nRetained profits\n/(losses)\nCapital contribution reserve\nTotal equity\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nAt 1 April 2022\n2,727\n3,250\n30\n(2,818)\n(6,620)\n158\n(3,273)\n(Loss)/Profit for period\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(444)\n-\n(444)\nOther comprehensive income for the period\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTotal comprehensive income for the period\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(444)\n-\n(444)\nIssue of shares\n133\n267\n-\n-\n-\n-\n400\nShare issue costs\n-\n(32)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n(32)\nLoan note equity\n157\n157\nMovement in loan note equity reserve\n-\n-\n(42)\n-\n42\n-\n-\nAt 30 September 2022\n2,860\n3,485\n145\n(2,818)\n(7,052)\n158\n(3,192)\nFor the purpose of preparing the consolidated financial statement of the Group, the share capital represents the nominal value of the issued share capital of 0.1p per share.

GENERAL INFORMATION\nThis financial information is for Trafalgar Property Group Plc (\"the Company\") and its subsidiary undertakings. The Company is incorporated in England and Wales.\n2. BASIS OF PREPARATION\nThe interim consolidated financial information has been prepared with regard to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted for use in the United Kingdom (UK IFRS). The interim financial information incorporates the results for the Group for the six month period from 1 April 2022 to 30 September 2022. The results for the year ended 31 March 2022 have been extracted from the statutory financial statements for the Group for the year ended 31 March 2022. The financial information set out in these interim consolidated financial information does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in S434 of the Companies Act 2006. They do not include all of the information required for full annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2022, which contained an unqualified audit report and have been filed with the Registrar of Companies. They did not contain statements under S498 of the Companies Act 2006.\nThe same accounting policies, presentation and methods of computation have been followed in these unaudited interim financial statements as those which were applied in the preparation of the group's annual financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2022.\nThe interim consolidated financial information incorporates the financial statements of Trafalgar Property Group Plc and its subsidiaries.\nThe interim financial information for the six months ended 30 September 2022 was approved by the directors on 21 December 2022\n3. SEGMENTAL REPORTING\nFor the purpose of IFRS 8, the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") takes the form of the Board of Directors. The Directors' opinion of the business of the Group is that the principal activity of the Group was property development and there is considered to be one reportable segment, that of property development carried on in the UK. The internal and external reporting is on a consolidated basis with transactions between Group companies eliminated on consolidation. Therefore the financial information of the single segment is the same as that set out in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidate statement of changes in equity, the consolidated statement of financial position and cash-flows.\nTRAFALGAR PROPERTY GROUP PLC\nCONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED INTERIM RESULTS FOR THE\nSIX MONTHS ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2022\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION\n4.

The conversion of the total amount owed to him by the Company (\u00a3905,000) has resulted in the issue to Mr C C Johnson of a new unsecured conversation loan note for an aggregate amount of \u00a3905,000, expiring 31 July 2024. This has replaced:\n- The \u00a3 600,000 unsecured convertible loan notes issued in July 2020 which would have been redeemable on 31 July 2022 and which were convertible at 2p per share (following the share consolidation in December 2020) and carried the right upon a conversion of the loan notes, to the grant of warrants to subscribe for ordinary shares on a one to one basis, exercisable at the conversion price of 2p for a period of two years from the date of grant;\n- The \u00a3 200,000 unsecured convertible loan notes comprised in the loan facility entered into in November 2021, which would have been redeemable on 30 November 2022, and which were convertible at 0.7p per share;\n- \u00a3 105,0000 owed to him by the Company on directors loan account.\nThe new unsecured convertible loan note is convertible in full into 226,250,000 ordinary shares of 0.4p per ordinary share and can be converted by Mr Johnson , subject inter alia to his entire holding being less than 29.99 per cent of the voting rights in issue in the Company.\nThe new unsecured convertible loan note carried the right upon a conversion, to the grant of warrants to subscribe for ordinary shares on a one for one basis, exercisable at the conversion price for a period of two year from the date of grant.\nLoan note equity reserve is the amount that has been provided for in respect of the difference between the cash value and liability element of the loan notes.\nThe convertible loan notes have been accounted for as having both a debt and an equity element. This results in the creation of a loan note equity reserve at the point of issue. This loan note equity reserve is the difference between the loan note value received by the company of \u00a3 905,000 (31 3 22: \u00a3800,000) and the fair value of a debt only instrument with a 10% imputed interest rate and a final settlement figure of \u00a3800,000 in July 2022.

The directors do not consider there has been any change in these valuations since the year end. In addition an offer and sale pending has been made on the freehold property at \u00a3 1,050,000. The one remaining property is being marketed following the tenants vacating the property. The prices attained were assessed by independent estate agents based on current prices in an active market for similar properties for similar locations and condition.\n11.\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nBoth investment properties within Selmat Ltd are under offer as at the date of signing these interim results. The property at Burnside is under offer at \u00a3325,000 with the survey and mortgage valuation already having been carried out. Completion is estimated for early January and we are currently awaiting exchange. Orchard House remains under offer at \u00a31,050,000 but the buyer has yet to sell their own property.\nThe Leatherhead site within Trafalgar Retirement + Ltd has been recently granted planning consent following a successful Appeal and we continue to hold an option to buy this site. We are currently exploring whether to sell this onto another interested purchaser as is, rather than undertake the actual development ourselves.\nTrafalgar New Homes Ltd after securing funds from Lloyds Bank in May 22 purchased a development site in Barden Road, Speldhurst, Kent, in July 2022. The purchase came with planning permissions for a single detached house and we are currently awaiting building regulation approval prior to appointing a contractor. This site is likely to commence building in January 2023.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The relevant legislation governing the Company is the United Kingdom Companies Act 2006 (\"Companies Act 2006\").\nOpinion\nWe have audited the financial statements of Trafalgar Property Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2023.\nThe financial statements that we have audited comprise:\n\u00b7\nthe Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income\n\u00b7\nthe Consolidated Statement of Financial Position\n\u00b7\nthe Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity\n\u00b7\nthe Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows\n\u00b7\nNotes 1 to 20 to the consolidated financial statements, including significant accounting policies\n\u00b7\nthe Company Balance Sheet\n\u00b7\nthe Company Statement of Changes in Equity and\n\u00b7\nNotes 1 to 13 to the Company financial statements, including significant accounting policies.\nThe financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted in the United Kingdom (\"UK adopted IFRS\"). The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Parent Company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 102 'The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland' (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).\nIn our opinion:\n\u00b7\nthe financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group's and of the Parent Company's affairs as at 31 March 2023 and of the Group's loss for the year then ended;\n\u00b7\nthe Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted in the United Kingdom (UK Adopted IFRS);\n\u00b7\nthe Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and\n\u00b7\nhave been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\nBasis for opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\nMaterial uncertainty related to going concern\nWe draw your attention to the going concern section of the accounting policies in the financial statements which states that the group incurred substantial losses during the year and the continued requirement for successful future equity or debt fund raising. The impact of this together with other matters set out in the note, indicate a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the group's ability to continue as a going concern. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\nOur evaluation of the Directors' assessment of the Group and the Parent Company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n\u00b7\nThe consideration of inherent risks to the Group's and Parent Company's operations and specifically their business model.\n\u00b7\nThe evaluation of how those risks might impact on the Group's and Parent Company's available financial resources.\n\u00b7\nReview of the mathematical accuracy of the cashflow forecast model prepared by management and corroboration of key data inputs to supporting documentation for consistency of assumptions used with our knowledge obtained during the audit.\n\u00b7\nChallenging management for reasonableness of assumptions in respect of the timing and quantum of cash receipts and payments included in the cash flow model.\n\u00b7\nWhere additional resources may be required the reasonableness and practicality of the assumptions made by the Directors when assessing the probability and likelihood of those resources becoming available.\n\u00b7\nHolding discussions with management regarding future financing plans, corroborating these where necessary and assessing the impact on the cash flow forecast.\n\u00b7\nEvaluating the accuracy of historical forecasts against actual results to ascertain the accuracy of management's forecasts.\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.\nOverview of our audit approach\nScope\nOur Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including the Group's system of internal control, and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. We also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including assessing whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that may have represented a risk of material misstatement.\nThe Group consists of seven reporting components, of which three were considered to be significant components: Trafalgar Property Group plc, Selmat Limited and Trafalgar New Homes Limited. The significant components were subjected to full scope audits for the purposes of our audit report on the Group financial statements.\nSignificant components were determined based on:\n1) financial significance of the component to the Group as a whole, and\n2) assessment of the risk of material misstatements applicable to each component.\nOur audit scope results in all major operations of the Group being subject to audit work.\nOverall Materiality\n2023\n2022\nGroup\n\u00a326,400\n\u00a335,800\n2% (2022: 2%) of gross assets\nParent Company\n\u00a319,600\n\u00a319,500\n2% (2022: 2%) of gross liabilities\nKey audit matters\nRecurring\n\u00b7\nUndisclosed related party transactions\nKey Audit Matters\nKey Audit Matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those matters which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\nUndisclosed related party transactions\nKey audit\nmatter description\nThe Group enters into a significant number of transactions with related parties, both intra-group transactions and with individuals related to the Group.\nThere is a risk that transactions (particularly any transactions which are not at arm's length) and balances with related parties are undisclosed or misclassified.\nHow the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter\nOur procedures included:\nIdentifying the susceptibility of the financial statements to material misstatement from related party relationships and transactions.\nObtaining management's records of related parties - who they are, the nature of these relationships, whether any related party transactions have been entered into in the year and the nature of those transactions.\nUnderstanding the controls procedures in place to identify, account for and disclose RP relationships and transactions, authorise and approve significant transactions and arrangements (both in the normal course of business and outside the normal course of business).\nAn assessment of the presentation of related party transactions within the financial statements, this focused primarily on the Directors loan accounts.\nWe reviewed movement on these balances in the year and vouched items to supporting evidence.\nWe discussed with management the nature and purpose of these items and considered whether disclosure sufficiently addressed these matters.\nIn addition, we obtained written confirmation of the balances from all disclosed parties and confirmed key terms to agreements.\nKey observations\nWe concluded that the classification and disclosure of related party transactions is complete and appropriate.\nOur application of materiality\nOur definition of materiality considers the value of error or omission on the financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, would change or influence the economic decision of a reasonably knowledgeable user of those financial statements. Misstatements below these levels will not necessarily be evaluated as immaterial as we also take account of the nature of identified misstatements, and the particular circumstances of their occurrence, when evaluating their effect on the financial statements as a whole. Materiality is used in planning the scope of our work, executing that work and evaluating the results.\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:\nGroup financial statements\nParent Company financial statements\nOverall materiality\n\u00a326,400 (2022: \u00a335,800)\n\u00a319,600 (2022: \u00a319,500)\nHow we determined it\n2% of gross assets (2021: 2% of gross assets)\n2% of gross liabilities (2021: 2% of gross liabilities)\nRationale for the benchmark applied\nWe consider gross assets to be the main measure by which the users of the financial statements assess the prospects and success of the Group. Therefore, we consider this to be the most appropriate benchmark for Group materiality.\nThe Parent Company is largely a holding company incurring limited costs and financing the group. As a result of historic losses and the impairment of investments, we have considered gross liabilities as the most appropriate benchmark for materiality.\nPerformance materiality is the application of materiality at the individual account or balance level, set at an amount to reduce, to an appropriately low level, the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality for the financial statements as a whole. Performance materiality for the Group was set at \u00a315,840 (2022: \u00a321,480) and at \u00a311,760 (2022: \u00a311,700) for the Parent Company which represents 60% (2022: 60%) of the above materiality levels. In determining performance materiality, we considered our understanding of the entity, including the quality of the control environment and whether we were able to rely on controls, and the nature, volume and size of uncorrected misstatements in the previous period.\nWe agreed with management that we would report to them all audit differences in excess of \u00a31,320 (2022: \u00a31,790) for the Group and \u00a3980 (2022: \u00a3975) for the Company as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to management on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.\nOverview of the scope of the Group and Parent Company audits\nOur assessment of audit risk, evaluation of materiality and our determination of performance materiality sets our audit scope for each company within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. This assessment takes into account the size, risk profile, organisation / distribution and effectiveness of group-wide controls, changes in the business environment and other factors such as recent internal audit results when assessing the level of work to be performed at each component.\nThe Group consists of 7 components, all of which are based in the UK and audited by the Group audit team.\nNumber of components\nRevenue\nTotal assets\nLoss before tax\nFull scope audit\n3\n100%\n96%\n98%\nAnalytical Review\n4\n0%\n4%\n2%\nTotal\n7\n100%\n100%\n100%\nThe control environment\nWe evaluated the design and implementation of those internal controls of the Group, including the Parent Company, which are relevant to our audit, such as those relating to the financial reporting cycle. We also tested operating effectiveness but did not place reliance on this work.\nReporting on other information\nThe other information comprises the information included in the annual report other than the financial\nstatements and our auditor's report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements, or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\nStrategic report and directors' report\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:\n\u00b7\nthe information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors' Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and\n\u00b7\nthe Strategic Report and the Directors' Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\nIn the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Parent Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors' report.\nMatters on which we are required to report by exception\nWe have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\u00b7\nadequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received by branches not visited by us; or\n\u00b7\nthe Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\n\u00b7\ncertain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or\n\u00b7\nwe have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.\nResponsibilities of directors\nAs explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement, as set out on page 9, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group's and the Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\nAuditor responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.\nMisstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\nA further description of our responsibilities for the financial statements is located on the FRC's website at:\nwww.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities\n. This description forms part of our auditor's report.\nExtent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud.\nThese audit procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements were free from fraud or error. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error and detecting irregularities that result from fraud is inherently more difficult than detecting those that result from error, as fraud may involve collusion, deliberate concealment, forgery or intentional misrepresentations. Also, the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely we would become aware of it.\nIdentifying and assessing potential risks arising from irregularities, including fraud\nThe extent of the procedures undertaken to identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud, included the following:\n\u00b7\nWe considered the nature of the industry and sector the control environment, business performance including remuneration policies and the Group's, including the Parent Company's, own risk assessment that irregularities might occur as a result of fraud or error. From our sector experience and through discussion with the directors, we obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks applicable to the Group focusing on laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a direct material effect on the financial statements, such as provisions of the Companies Act 2006, UK tax legislation or those that had a fundamental effect on the operations of the Group.\n\u00b7\nWe enquired of the directors and management concerning the Group's and the Parent Company's policies and procedures relating to:\n-\nidentifying, evaluating and complying with the laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances of non-compliance;\n-\ndetecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they had any knowledge of actual or suspected fraud; and\n-\nthe internal controls established to mitigate risks related to fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations.\n\u00b7\nWe discussed among the engagement team regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and any potential indicators of fraud.\n\u00b7\nWe assessed the susceptibility of the financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by evaluating management's incentives and opportunities for manipulation of the financial statements. This included utilising the spectrum of inherent risk and an evaluation of the risk of management override of controls. We determined that the principal risks were related to posting inappropriate journal entries to increase revenue or reduce costs, creating fictitious transactions to hide losses or to improve financial performance, and management bias in any accounting estimates.\nAudit response to risks identified\nIn respect of the above procedures:\n\u00b7\nwe corroborated the results of our enquiries through our review of the minutes of the Group's and the Parent Company's board meetings and enquiries of management regarding any ongoing legal cases;\n\u00b7\naudit procedures performed by the engagement team in connection with the risks identified included:\n-\nPerforming audit work over the risk of management override of controls, including testing of journal entries and other adjustments for appropriateness, evaluating the business rationale of significant transactions outside the normal course of business, and reviewing accounting estimates for bias.\n-\nReviewing financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\n-\nChallenging assumptions and judgements made by management in their significant accounting estimates, in particular with respect to provisions for claims incurred but not reported.\n\u00b7\nthe Senior Statutory Auditor considered the experience and expertise of the engagement team to ensure that the team had the appropriate competence and capabilities; and\n\u00b7\nwe communicated relevant laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team members, and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout the audit.\nUse of our report\nThis report is made solely to the Parent Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.

The new requirements do not prevent a seller-lessee from recognising in profit or loss any gain or loss relating to the partial or full termination of a lease.\nThe Group does not expect a material impact on its consolidated financial statements from these amendments.\nThe Group adopt early the following amendments to standards which are not yet mandatory.\nAmendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current\n(issued January 2020)\nThe amendments clarify that the classification of a liability as current or non-current is based only on rights existing at the end of the reporting period and the classification is not affected by expectations about whether rights to settle or defer a liability will be exercised. Further, the amendments clarify that the settlement of a liability refers to the transfer of cash, convertible debts, other assets, or services to the counterparty. This amendment only affects presentation.\nThe amendment is effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2024 and has not yet been adopted for use in the United Kingdom.\nThe Group does not expect a material impact on its consolidated financial statements from these amendments.\nAdoption of the following standards does not have an impact on the consolidated financial statement of the Group:\nAmendments to IFRS 3 - References to the conceptual framework\n(issued in May 2020)\nThe amendments change references and cross-references from IFRS 3 to the Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements.\nThe amendment is effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2022.\nThe Group does not expect a material impact on its consolidated financial statements from these amendments.\nAmendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment\n(issued in May 2020)\nThe amendments require any proceeds from selling items produced (and related production costs) in the course of bringing an item property, plant and equipment into operation to be recognised in profit or loss clarifying that such items are not reflected in the cost of the asset.\nThe amendment is effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2022.\nThe Group does not expect a material impact on its consolidated financial statements from these amendments.\nAmendments to IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets\n(issued in May 2020)\nThe amendments clarify that the cost of fulfilling a contract are costs that relate directly to\nthat contract. Such costs can be the incremental costs of fulfilling that contract or an allocation of other costs directly related to fulfilling that contract.\nThe amendment is effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2022.\nThe Group does not expect a material impact on its consolidated financial statements from these amendments.\nAmendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement - Disclosure of Accounting policies\n(issued in February 2021)\nThe amendments enhance the disclosure requirements relating to an entity's accounting policies and clarify that the notes to a complete set of financial statements are required to include material accounting policy information. Material accounting policy information, when considered with other information included in the financial statements, can reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of financial statements make on the basis of the financial statements. The amendments help preparers determine what constitutes material accounting policy information and notes that accounting policy information which focuses on how IFRS has been applied to its own circumstances is more useful for users of financial statements than standardised information or information duplicating the requirements of IFRS.\nThe amendment also states that immaterial accounting policy information need not be disclosed but when it is disclosed it shall not obscure material accounting policy information. Further, if accounting policy information is not deemed material this does not affect the materiality of related disclosure requirements of IFRS.\nThe disclosure of judgements made in applying accounting policies should reflect those that have had the most significant effect on items recognised in the financial statements.\nThe amendment is effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2023 and has not yet been adopted for use in the United Kingdom.\nThe Group does not expect a material impact on its consolidated financial statements from these amendments.\nAmendments to IAS 8 - Definition of Accounting Estimates\n(issued in February 2021)\nThe amendments introduce a new definition of accounting estimates and also clarify the distinction between changes in accounting estimates, changes in accounting policies and the correction of errors.\nThe amendment is effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2023 and has not yet been adopted for use in the United Kingdom.\nThe Group does not expect a material impact on its consolidated financial statements from these amendments.\nAmendments to IAS 12 Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction\n(issued 7 May 2021)\nThe amendments specify how companies should account for deferred tax on transactions such as leases and decommissioning obligations.\nIn specified circumstances, companies are exempt from recognising deferred tax when they recognise assets or liabilities for the first time. Previously, there had been some uncertainty about whether the exemption applied to transactions such as leases and decommissioning obligations-transactions for which companies recognise both an asset and a liability.\nThe amendments clarify that the exemption does not apply and that companies are required to recognise deferred tax on such transactions. The aim of the amendments is to reduce diversity in the reporting of deferred tax on leases and decommissioning obligations.\nThe amendments are effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2023 and have not yet been adopted for use in the United Kingdom.\nThe Group does not expect a material impact on its consolidated financial statements from these amendments.\nAnnual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020\n(Issued May 2020)\nThe improvements to IFRS address the following:\n\u00b7\nAmendments to IFRS 1\n- a subsidiary which adopts IFRS for the first time may elect, in its financial statements, to measure cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations at the carrying amount that would be included in the parent's consolidated financial statements, based on the parent's date of transition to IFRSs if no adjustments were made for consolidation procedures and for the effects of the business combination in which the parent acquired the subsidiary. A similar election is available to an associate or joint venture.\n\u00b7\nAmendments to IFRS 9\n- in regard to the derecognition of financial liabilities, the amendment to IFRS 9 clarifies that when undertaking the 10% derecognition test that in the determination of fees paid net of fees received, a borrower includes only fees paid or received between the borrower and the lender, including fees paid or received by either the borrower or lender on the other's behalf.\n\u00b7\nAmendments to IAS 41\n- the amendment clarifies that when determining fair value of a biological asset an entity does not include any cash flows for financing the assets, taxation, or re-establishing biological assets after harvest (for example, the cost of replanting trees in a plantation forest after harvest).\n\u00b7\nAmendments to IFRS 16\n- the amendments make one of the worked examples in the application guidance clearer to follow.\nThe amendment is effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2022.\nThe Group does not expect a material impact on its consolidated financial statements from these amendments.\nBusiness Combination\nOn the acquisition of a subsidiary, the business combination is accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregated amount of the fair value of the consideration transferred, measured at the date of acquisition. The consideration paid is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) assumed on the basis of fair values at the date of acquisition. Acquisition costs are expensed when incurred and included in general and administrative expenses.\nB\nA\nSIS\nO\nF\nC\nO\nN\nS\nO\nL\nI\nD\nA\nT\nI\nON\nT\nh\ne c\no\nns\no\nli\nd\nated\nf\ni\nn\na\nn\ncial\ns\nt\nat\ne\nm\ne\nn\nts\ni\nn\nc\norpor\nate t\nh\ne\nf\ni\nn\na\nn\nc\ni\nal\ns\ntat\ne\nm\ne\nn\nt\ns\no\nf\nt\nh\ne company a\nn\nd its\ns\nu\nb\ns\ni\nd\nia\nr\ni\ne\ns\n.\nT\nh\ne\nr\nes\nu\nlts\no\nf\ns\nu\nb\ns\ni\nd\nia\nr\nies a\nc\nq\nu\nired\nd\nu\nr\ni\nn\ng\nt\nh\ne\ny\ne\na\nr a\nr\ne i\nn\nc\nl\nu\nd\ned\nf\nr\no\nm t\nh\ne\nd\nate\no\nf a\ncq\nu\ni\ns\ni\nti\no\nn\n,\nb\nei\nn\ng\nt\nh\ne\nd\nate\no\nn\nw\nh\ni\nc\nh t\nh\ne G\nro\nu\np\nob\ntai\nn\ns c\no\nn\nt\nr\no\nl.\nT\nh\ne\ny a\nr\ne\nd\ne\nco\nns\no\nli\nd\nated\no\nn t\nh\ne\nd\nate\nt\nh\nat c\no\nn\ntr\no\nl\nc\ne\na\ns\nes.\nW\nh\nen\nt\nh\ne G\nr\no\nu\np c\ne\nases to\nh\na\nv\ne c\no\nn\ntr\no\nl\no\nr\ns\ni\ng\nn\ni\nf\nic\na\nn\nt\ni\nn\nf\nl\nu\ne\nn\nc\ne\n, a\nn\ny\nr\neta\ni\nn\ned\ni\nn\nte\nr\nest in\nt\nh\ne\ne\nn\nti\nt\ny\ni\ns\nr\ne\nm\ne\na\nsu\nr\ned to its\nf\na\nir\nv\na\nl\nu\ne,\nw\ni\nt\nh\nt\nh\ne\nc\nh\na\nng\ne in c\nar\nr\ny\ni\nn\ng\na\nm\nou\nn\nt\nr\ne\ncog\nn\ni\ns\ned\ni\nn\npro\nf\nit\no\nr l\no\nss\n.\nT\nh\ne\nf\nair\nv\nal\nu\ne is\nt\nh\ne\ni\nn\niti\na\nl c\narr\ny\ni\nn\ng\na\nm\no\nun\nt\nf\no\nr t\nh\ne\np\nu\nr\npo\ns\nes\no\nf\nsu\nb\ns\ne\nq\nu\ne\nn\ntl\ny a\nc\nc\nou\nn\nt\ni\nn\ng\nf\no\nr t\nh\ne\nr\netai\nn\ned i\nn\nte\nr\ne\ns\nt as an as\ns\no\nciat\ne\n,\nj\no\ni\nn\nt\nv\ne\nn\nt\nu\nr\ne\no\nr\nf\ni\nn\na\nn\nci\na\nl a\ns\ns\net.\nI\nn a\ndd\nitio\nn\n, a\nn\ny\na\nm\no\nun\nt\ns\npr\ne\nv\ni\no\nus\nl\ny\nr\ne\ncog\nn\ni\ns\ned in\no\nt\nh\ner c\no\nm\npr\ne\nh\ne\nns\ni\nv\ne\ni\nn\nc\no\nm\ne\ni\nn\nr\nes\np\ne\nc\nt\no\nf t\nh\nat e\nn\nti\nt\ny a\nr\ne a\nc\nc\no\nun\nted\nf\no\nr as if\nt\nh\ne G\nro\nu\np\nh\nad\nd\nire\nc\ntly\nd\ni\ns\npo\ns\ned\no\nf\nt\nh\ne\nr\nelat\ne\nd as\ns\nets\no\nr lia\nb\nili\nt\nie\ns\n.\nT\nh\nis\nm\na\ny\nm\ne\na\nn\nt\nh\ne\na\nm\no\nu\nn\nts\npr\ne\nv\ni\no\nus\nl\ny\nr\ne\ncog\nn\ni\ns\ned\ni\nn\no\nt\nh\ne\nr c\no\nm\npr\ne\nh\ne\nn\ns\ni\nv\ne\ni\nn\nc\no\nm\ne a\nr\ne\nr\ne\nc\nlas\ns\ni\nf\nied to\npro\nf\nit\no\nr l\no\nss\n.\nC\no\nn\ntr\no\nl is a\nc\nh\nie\nv\ned\nw\nh\nen\nt\nh\ne Company:\n\u00b7\nh\nas t\nh\ne\np\no\nw\ner\no\nv\ner t\nh\ne\ni\nn\nv\nestee;\n\u00b7\nis e\nx\npo\ns\ned\no\nr\nh\nis\nr\ni\ng\nh\nt\ns\n,\nt\no\nv\na\nr\nia\nb\nle\nr\net\nu\nr\nn\ns\nf\nr\no\nm i\nt\ns i\nnvo\nl\nv\ne\nm\ne\nn\nt\nw\ni\nt\nh\nt\nh\ne i\nn\nv\ne\ns\ntee; a\nn\nd\n\u00b7\nh\nas t\nh\ne a\nb\nili\nt\ny to\nu\ns\ne its\npo\nw\ner to a\nf\nf\ne\nc\nt its\nr\ne\nt\nu\nrn\ns\n.\nFUN\nC\nT\nI\nO\nN\nA\nL\nC\nU\nRR\nE\nN\nC\nY\nI\nt\ne\nm\ns\ni\nn\ncl\nu\nd\ned in t\nh\ne\nf\ni\nn\na\nn\nci\na\nl\ns\ntat\ne\nm\ne\nn\nts\no\nf e\na\nc\nh\no\nf t\nh\ne G\nro\nu\np\n'\ns e\nn\ntit\ni\nes a\nr\ne\nm\ne\na\ns\nu\nr\ned\nu\ns\ni\nn\ng\nt\nh\ne c\nu\nrr\ne\nn\nc\ny\no\nf t\nh\ne\npr\ni\nm\na\nr\ny e\nco\nn\no\nm\nic e\nn\nv\nir\nonm\ne\nn\nt\ni\nn\nw\nh\ni\nc\nh\nt\nh\ne e\nn\nt\ni\nt\ny\nop\ne\nr\nates\n(\n'\nt\nh\ne\nfu\nn\ncti\no\nn\na\nl c\nu\nrr\ne\nn\nc\ny\n'\n)\n.\nT\nh\ne c\no\nns\no\nli\nd\nated\nf\ni\nn\na\nn\nci\na\nl\ns\ntat\ne\nm\ne\nn\nt\ns a\nr\ne\npr\nese\nn\nted in\nP\no\nun\nd\ns Sterl\ni\nn\ng\n(\n\u00a3\n)\n,\nw\nh\ni\nc\nh is t\nh\ne\nC\no\nm\np\na\nn\ny\n'\ns\nfu\nn\nc\nti\no\nn\nal a\nn\nd t\nh\ne G\nro\nu\np'\ns\npr\nese\nn\ntati\no\nn\nc\nu\nrr\ne\nn\nc\ny\n.\nIn preparing these financial statements, transactions in currencies other than the Company and Group's presentational currency (\"foreign currencies\") are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transaction.

At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt. The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible loan notes and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Group, is included in equity. Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible loan notes based on their relative carrying amounts at the date of issue. The portion relating to the equity component is charged directly against equity. The interest expense on the liability component is calculated by applying the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt to the liability component of the instrument. The difference between this amount and the interest paid is added to the carrying amount of the convertible loan note.\nSha\nr\ne c\nap\nit\na\nl\nO\nrd\ni\nn\na\nr\ny\ns\nh\na\nr\ne c\nap\nital is cla\ns\ns\ni\nf\nied as e\nq\nu\nit\ny\n.\nI\nn\nte\nr\ni\nm\nord\ni\nn\na\nr\ny\nd\ni\nv\ni\nd\ne\nn\nd\ns a\nr\ne\nr\ne\nco\ngn\ni\ns\ne\nd\nw\nh\ne\nn\np\naid a\nn\nd\nf\ni\nn\nal\nord\ni\nn\na\nr\ny\nd\ni\nv\ni\nd\ne\nn\nd\ns a\nr\ne\nr\ne\nco\ng\nn\ni\ns\ned as a lia\nb\nili\nt\ny\ni\nn\nt\nh\ne\ny\ne\na\nr in\nw\nh\ni\nc\nh t\nh\ne\ny a\nr\ne a\nppro\nv\ne\nd\n.\nDeferred shares were created as part of a subdivision of shares but carry no voting rights and no right to participate in the profits of the company.\nI\nm\npa\ni\nr\nme\nn\nt\no\nf fi\nnan\nc\ni\na\nl\na\nss\nets\nIFRS 9 offers two approaches for measuring and recognizing the loss allowance: General and Simplified. The general approach should be applied for all financial assets subject to impairment, except for trade receivables or contract assets (IFRS 15) without significant financing component, for these assets simplified approach should be applied. The Group's financial instruments measured at amortised cost falling within the scope of the standard are (i) trade and other receivables and (ii) cash and cash equivalents. While cash and cash equivalents are also subject to the impairment requirements of IFRS 9, the identified impairment loss was immaterial.\nTrade and other receivables\nThe Group applies the IFRS 9 Simplified approach, by recognising a loss allowance based on a lifetime expected credit loss (\"ECL\") at each reporting date.\nFi\nnan\nci\na\nl li\nab\nili\nt\nies:\nA\nt\na\nm\nor\nti\ns\ned c\no\ns\nt\nFi\nn\na\nn\ncial lia\nb\nili\nt\ni\ne\ns\nw\nh\ni\nc\nh a\nr\ne\nn\nei\nt\nh\ner c\no\nn\nti\nn\ng\ne\nn\nt c\no\nns\ni\nd\ne\nr\nat\ni\no\nn\no\nf an a\ncq\nu\nirer in a\nb\nus\ni\nn\ne\ns\ns c\no\nm\nb\ni\nn\nati\no\nn\n,\nh\neld\nf\no\nr tra\nd\ni\nng\n,\nn\no\nr\nd\nesig\nn\nated as at\nf\nair\nv\nal\nu\ne t\nh\nroug\nh\npro\nf\nit\no\nr l\no\ns\ns a\nr\ne\nsu\nb\ns\ne\nq\nu\ne\nn\nt\nl\ny\nm\ne\na\nsu\nr\ned at\na\nm\nor\nti\ns\ned c\no\ns\nt\nus\ni\nn\ng t\nh\ne e\nf\nf\ne\nc\nt\ni\nv\ne i\nn\nte\nr\ne\ns\nt\nm\ne\nt\nh\nod\n.\nT\nh\nis is a\nm\ne\nt\nh\no\nd\no\nf c\na\nlc\nu\nlat\ni\nn\ng\nt\nh\ne\na\nm\nor\nti\ns\ned c\no\ns\nt\no\nf a\nf\ni\nn\na\nn\nci\na\nl lia\nb\nili\nt\ny\na\nn\nd\no\nf all\no\nc\na\nti\nn\ng i\nn\nte\nr\nest e\nx\np\ne\nns\ne\nov\ner t\nh\ne\nr\nele\nv\na\nn\nt\np\ne\nr\ni\nod\n.\nT\nh\ne e\nf\nf\ne\nc\nt\ni\nv\ne i\nn\nte\nr\nest\nr\nate is\nt\nh\ne\nr\nate t\nh\nat e\nx\na\nc\nt\nl\ny\nd\ni\ns\nc\nou\nn\nts est\ni\nm\nated\nf\nu\nt\nu\nr\ne c\na\ns\nh\np\na\nym\ne\nn\nt\ns t\nh\nrou\ng\nh\nt\nh\ne e\nx\np\ne\nc\nted li\nf\ne\no\nf t\nh\ne\nf\ni\nn\na\nn\ncial lia\nb\nili\nt\ny\n,\no\nr\nw\nh\ne\nr\ne a\npp\nr\nopr\niate a\nsh\nor\nter\np\ne\nr\ni\nod\n,\nt\no t\nh\ne\na\nm\nor\nti\ns\ned c\no\ns\nt\no\nf a\nf\ni\nn\na\nn\ncial lia\nb\nili\nt\ny\n.\nDe\nr\ne\nco\ngn\niti\no\nn\no\nf\nf\ni\nn\na\nn\ncial li\na\nb\nili\nt\nies\nT\nh\ne C\no\nm\np\na\nn\ny\nd\ne-\nr\ne\ncog\nn\ni\ns\ne\nf\ni\nn\na\nn\nci\na\nl lia\nb\nili\nt\nies\nw\nh\ne\nn\n, a\nn\nd\no\nn\nl\ny\nw\nh\ne\nn\n, t\nh\ne C\no\nm\np\na\nn\ny\n's\nob\nli\ng\nati\non\ns a\nr\ne\nd\ni\ns\nc\nh\na\nr\ng\ne\nd\n, c\na\nn\nc\ne\nlled\no\nr t\nh\ne\ny\ne\nx\np\nire.\nC\nA\nSH AND\nC\nASH EQU\nI\nV\nA\nL\nEN\nT\nS\nC\na\ns\nh a\nn\nd c\na\ns\nh e\nq\nu\ni\nv\nal\ne\nn\nts c\no\nm\npr\ni\ns\ne c\na\ns\nh\nb\nala\nn\nc\ne\ns a\nn\nd\nd\ne\npo\ns\nits\nh\neld at c\na\nll\nw\ni\nt\nh\nb\na\nn\nk\ns\nw\ni\nt\nh\nm\nat\nu\nr\ni\nt\nies\no\nf\nt\nh\nr\nee\nm\no\nn\nt\nh\ns\no\nr le\ns\ns\nf\nr\no\nm\ni\nn\nc\nep\nti\no\nn\n.\nI\nNV\nE\nN\nT\nO\nR\nI\nES\nI\nnv\ne\nn\nt\nor\nies c\no\nns\ni\ns\nt\no\nf\nthe original acquisition of land for development, including costs associated with planning, and\nprop\ne\nr\nties\nun\nd\ner c\non\ns\ntr\nu\nc\nt\ni\no\nn\na\nn\nd a\nr\ne\ns\ntated at\nt\nh\ne l\no\nw\ner\no\nf c\no\ns\nt a\nn\nd\nn\net\nr\ne\na\nl\ni\ns\na\nb\nle\nv\nal\nu\ne.\nC\no\ns\nt c\no\nm\npr\ni\ns\nes\nd\nire\nc\nt\nm\nate\nr\ni\na\nls a\nn\nd\n,\nw\nh\ne\nr\ne a\npp\nlica\nb\nle,\nd\nire\nc\nt la\nbo\nu\nr c\no\ns\nts\na\nn\nd\nt\nh\no\ns\ne\no\nv\ne\nr\nh\ne\nad\ns t\nh\na\nt\nh\na\nv\ne\nb\ne\ne\nn i\nn\nc\nu\nrr\ned\ni\nn\nbr\ni\nn\ng\ni\nn\ng\nt\nh\ne\ni\nn\nv\ne\nn\nt\nor\nies to\nt\nh\neir\npr\nese\nn\nt l\no\nc\na\nt\ni\no\nn a\nn\nd c\no\nn\nd\niti\no\nn\n.\nI\nn\nte\nr\ne\ns\nt\no\nn\ns\nu\nm\ns\nborr\no\nw\ned\nt\nh\nat\nf\ni\nn\na\nn\nce\ns\np\ne\nc\ni\nf\nic\npro\nj\ne\nc\nts is a\ndd\ned to c\no\ns\nt.

The current Convertible debts are accounted for as having both a debt and an equity element. The difference between the loan note value received by the company and the fair value of a debt only instrument with imputed interest rate and with a final settlement figure is recognized under loan note equity reserve account at the point of issue. This loan note equity reserve has a 10% imputed interest rate as managements' best estimate as to the interest rate that would be expected from the market for an unsecured loan without a conversion element. Convertible debt consists of unsecured loan notes convertible, totaling \u00a3905,000 (2022: \u00a3905,000) in full, into 226,250,000 ordinary shares at 0.4p per ordinary share and can be convertible

Companies with profits of \u00a350,000 or less will continue to be taxed at 19%, which is a new small profits rate. Where taxable profits are between \u00a350,000 and \u00a3250,000, the higher 25% rate will apply but with a marginal relief applying as profits.

The conversion of the total amount owed to him by the Company (\u00a3905,000) has resulted in the issue to Mr C C Johnson of a new unsecured conversation loan note for an aggregate amount of \u00a3905,000, expiring 31 July 2024. This has replaced:\n\u00b7\nThe \u00a3 600,000 unsecured convertible loan notes issued in July 2020 which would have been redeemable on 31 July 2022 and which were convertible at 2p per share (following the share consolidation in December 2020) and carried the right upon a conversion of the loan notes, to the grant of warrants to subscribe for ordinary shares on a one to one basis, exercisable at the conversion price of 2p for a period of two years from the date of grant;\n\u00b7\nThe \u00a3 200,000 unsecured convertible loan notes comprised in the loan facility entered into in November 2021, which would have been redeemable on 30 November 2022, and which were convertible at 0.7p per share;\n\u00b7\n\u00a3 105,0000 owed to him by the Company on directors' loan account.\nThe new unsecured convertible loan note is convertible in full into 226,250,000 ordinary shares of 0.4p per ordinary share and can be converted by Mr Johnson, subject inter alia to his entire holding being less than 29.99 per cent of the voting rights in issue in the Company.\nThe new unsecured convertible loan note carried the right upon a conversion, to the grant of warrants to subscribe for ordinary shares on a one for one basis, exercisable at the conversion price for a period of two year from the date of grant.\nLoan note equity reserve is the amount that has been provided for in respect of the difference between the cash value and liability element of the loan notes.\nThe convertible loan notes have been accounted for as having both a debt and an equity element. This results in the creation of a loan note equity reserve at the point of issue. This loan note equity reserve is the difference between the loan note value received by the company of \u00a3 905,000 (31 3 22: \u00a3800,000) and the fair value of a debt only instrument with a 10% imputed interest rate and a final settlement figure of \u00a3905,000 in July 2024. This 10% imputed interest rate of \u00a380,165 (2022: \u00a333,058), is managements' best estimate as to the interest rate that would be expected from the market for an unsecured loan of \u00a3905,000 without a conversion element.\nDeferred shares do not entitle the holder to receive notice of and to attend or vote at any general meeting of the Company or to receive dividends or other distributions. Upon winding up or dissolution of the Company the holders of deferred shares shall be entitled to receive an amount equal to the nominal amount paid up thereon, but only after holders of ordinary shares have received \u00a3100,000 per ordinary share. Holders of deferred shares are not entitled to any further rights of participation in the assets of the Company. The Company has the right to purchase the deferred shares in issue at any time for no consideration.\nIss\nued,\na\nl\nl\no\nt\nt\ne\nd\na\nnd\nf\nu\nl\nl\ny\np\na\ni\nd\n2\n023\n2\n022\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nO\nrdi\nn\na\nry\ns\nh\na\nr\nes b/fwd\n142,519\n142,519\nDe\nf\ne\nr\nr\ne\nd\ns\nh\na\nr\ne\ns b/fwd\n2,584,298\n2,584,298\nIss\nued in\ny\ne\na\nr -\no\nrdi\nn\na\nry\ns\nh\na\nr\nes\n133,333\n-\nIssued in year - deferred shares\n-\n-\n2\n,860\n,150\n2\n,\n726,817\nFor the purpose of preparing the consolidated financial statement of the Group, share capital represents the nominal value of the issued share capital of 0.1p per share (2022: 0.1p per share).

The 0.09p deferred shares of 0.09p each were consolidated into deferred shares of 0.9p each ranking pari passu as one class with the existing deferred shares of 0.9p each.\nOn 14 July 2020, 937,500,000 ordinary shares of 0.01p each were issued under a placing at 0.08p each (at a premium of 0.07p per share) to raise \u00a3750,000 before costs of \u00a366,863.\nIn addition, on 14 July 2020 warrants to subscribe for ordinary shares of 0.01p were granted as follows:\n(a) Subscribers to the placing were granted warrants to subscribe for up to 937,500,000 shares for a period of two years, exercisable at 0.2p per share;\n(b) Peterhouse Capital Limited was granted warrants to subscribe for shares equivalent up to 3% of the issued ordinary share capital from time to time, exercisable for a period of two years, at 0.08p per share.\nFollowing the consolidation of ordinary shares in December 2020, the warrants have been adjusted and comprise place warrants to subscribe for up to 93,750,000 ordinary shares of 0.1p at 2p per share, and the warrants held by Peterhouse Capital Limited are exercisable at 0.8p per share.\nIn relation to the granting of these warrants to Peterhouse Capital Limited, these fall under the requirements of IAS 39 Financial Instruments and as such are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss. At the grant date of these warrants these are valued using a Black Scholes model to determine the intrinsic value of the warrant and a liability is recognized for this amount with a corresponding expense through the income statement. The Directors' have concluded that the intrinsic value of the warrant as at 31 March 2021 is not material to the results and subsequent movements in the share price have decreased this value further. As such no accounting entries have been made to these results.\nFurther on 14 July 2020, \u00a3600,000 of convertible loan notes were issued to Mr C C Johnson as part of arrangements to reorganise loans between him and the Group. The notes are repayable on 31 July 2022 and are convertible at any time into 300,000,000 ordinary shares of 0.01p at 0.2p per share. On conversion, warrants to subscribe for up to 300,000,000 ordinary shares will be granted to Mr C C Johnson exercisable for a period of two years from the date of grant at 0.2p per share. Following the consolidation of ordinary shares in December 2020, the loan notes have been adjusted and are convertible into 30,000,000 ordinary shares of 0.1p at 2p per share, with warrants to be granted to subscribe for up to 30,000,000 ordinary shares of 0.1p each at 2p per share, with warrants to be granted to subscribe for up to 30,000,000 ordinary shares of 0.1p each at 2p per share.\nThe convertible loan notes have been accounted for as having both a debt and an equity element. This results in the creation of a loan note equity reserve at the point of issue. This loan note equity reserve is the difference between the loan note value received by the Company of \u00a3600,000 and the fair value of a debt only instrument with a 10% imputed interest rate and a final settlement figure of \u00a3600,000 in July 2022. This 10% imputed interest rate is managements' best estimate as to the interest rate that would be expected from the market for an unsecured loan of \u00a3600,000 without a conversion element.\nIn 2022, the Company has agreed with Mr C C Johnson a consolidation and variation of terms of the two unsecured convertible loans notes and director debt held by Mr C C Johnson. The conversion of the total amount owed to him by the Company (\u00a3905,000) has resulted in the issue to Mr C C Johnson of a new unsecured convertible loan note for an aggregate amount of \u00a3905,000 payable July 2024. This has replaced:\n\u00b7\nThe \u00a3600,000 unsecured convertible loan notes issued in July 2020, which would have been redeemable on 31 July 2022, and which were convertible at 2p per share (following the share consolidation in December 2020) and carried the right upon a conversion of the loan notes, to the grant of warrants to subscribe for ordinary shares on a one for one basis, exercisable at the conversion price of 2p for a period of two years from the date of grant;\n\u00b7\nThe \u00a3200,000 unsecured convertible loan notes comprised in the loan facility entered into in November 2021, which would have been redeemable on 30 November 2022, and which were convertible at 0.7p per share.\n\u00b7\n\u00a3105,000 owed to him by the Company on directors loan account.\nThe new unsecured convertible loan note is convertible in full into 226,250,000 ordinary shares at 0.4p per ordinary share and can be converted at any time by Mr Johnson, subject inter alia to his entire holding being less than 29.99 per cent of the voting rights in issue in the Company.\nO\nr\nd\ni\nn\na\nr\ny\nsh\na\nr\nes e\nn\nt\nit\nl\ne t\nh\ne\nh\no\nl\nd\ne\nr\nt\no\nr\ne\nc\ne\ni\nv\ne\nn\no\nt\nice\no\nf a\nn\nd\nt\no atte\nn\nd\no\nr\nv\no\nt\ne at a\nn\ny\ng\ne\nn\ne\nr\nal\nm\ne\ne\nti\nn\ng\no\nf\nt\nh\ne\nC\no\nm\np\na\nn\ny\no\nr\nt\no\nr\ne\nc\nei\nv\ne\nd\ni\nv\ni\nd\ne\nn\nd\ns\no\nr\no\nt\nh\ne\nr\nd\ni\ns\ntr\ni\nb\nu\nt\ni\no\nn\ns\n.\nDe\nf\ne\nr\nr\ned\nsh\na\nr\nes\nd\no\nn\no\nt e\nn\nt\ni\ntle t\nh\ne\nh\no\nl\nd\ne\nr\nt\no\nr\ne\nc\ne\ni\nv\ne\nno\nti\nc\ne\no\nf a\nn\nd to atte\nn\nd\no\nr\nv\no\nt\ne at\na\nn\ny\ng\ne\nn\ne\nr\na\nl\nm\ne\ne\nti\nn\ng\no\nf t\nh\ne\nC\no\nm\np\na\nn\ny\no\nr to\nr\ne\nc\nei\nv\ne\nd\ni\nv\ni\nd\ne\nn\nd\ns\no\nr\no\nt\nh\ner\nd\ni\ns\nt\nr\ni\nb\nu\nt\ni\no\nn\ns\n.\nU\npo\nn\nw\ni\nn\nd\ni\nn\ng\nu\np\no\nr\nd\ni\ns\ns\no\nl\nu\nt\ni\no\nn\no\nf t\nh\ne\nC\no\nm\np\na\nn\ny t\nh\ne\nh\no\nl\nd\ne\nr\ns\no\nf\nd\ne\nf\ne\nr\nr\ne\nd\nsh\na\nr\nes\nsh\na\nl\nl\nb\ne e\nn\nt\ni\ntl\ne\nd\nt\no\nr\ne\nc\ne\ni\nv\ne an a\nm\no\nun\nt e\nq\nu\nal\nt\no t\nh\ne\nn\no\nm\ni\nn\nal a\nm\nou\nn\nt\np\na\ni\nd\nu\np t\nh\ne\nr\ne\no\nn\n,\nb\nu\nt\no\nn\nly a\nf\nt\ne\nr\nh\no\nl\nd\ne\nr\ns\no\nf\no\nr\nd\ni\nn\na\nr\ny\nsh\na\nr\nes\nh\na\nv\ne\nr\ne\nc\ne\ni\nv\ned \u00a3\n10\n0\n,\n0\n0\n0\np\ne\nr\no\nr\nd\ni\nn\na\nr\ny s\nh\na\nr\ne.\nH\no\nl\nd\ner\ns\no\nf\nd\ne\nf\ne\nr\nre\nd\nsh\na\nr\nes a\nr\ne not entitled to any further rights of participation in the assets of the Company.

Details of how to appoint the Chairman of the Meeting or another person as your proxy using the proxy form are set out in the notes to the proxy form.\n4. You may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to different shares.
