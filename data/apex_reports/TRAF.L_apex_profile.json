The directors continue to seek other opportunities for Trafalgar and the results for the six months to 30 September 2025 reflect that we are building assets to take advantage of the market in the future.\"\nCopies of the interim report will be available later today on the Company's website,\nwww.trafalgarproperty.group\nEnquiries:\nTrafalgar Property Group Plc\nPaul Treadway\n+44 (0) 1732 700 000\nSpark Advisory Partners Ltd - AIM Nominated Adviser\nMatt Davis/James Keeshan\n+44 (0) 20 3368 3550\nAlbR Capital Limited - Broker\nDuncan Vasey/Lucy Williams\n+44(0)20 7409 0930\nNotes to Editors:\nTrafalgar Property Plc is the holding company of Trafalgar New Homes Limited, Selmat Limited and Trafalgar Retirement+ Limited, residential property developers operating in the southeast of England.

Revenue for the period was \u00a3715,000 and cost of sales was \u00a3742,948 giving a gross loss for the period of \u00a327,948.\nMortgage and private loan interest was paid during the period of \u00a349,293 of which \u00a340,032 was capitalized as part of inventory as relating to the development at Talbot Park.\nThe result of the above is a loss before taxation for the period of \u00a3155,451.\nThe directors continue to consider relevant information including the on-going cost-of-living issues, static higher interest rates and unpredictable inflation, which are driving a challenging market and have performed a robust analysis of future cash flows.\nBased on their assessments and having regard to resources available to the entity, the directors have concluded that they can continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.\nA summary of activities in the 6 months to 30 September 2025 for the Group are as follows:\n-\nTrafalgar New Homes agreed a construction contract with a local developer for the construction of two detached properties on the Talbot Park site. Construction has started and it is expected that completion of the two properties will be April 2026. The site at Speldhurst was eventually sold in the period for \u00a3715,000.\n-\nDuring the period, the Company acquired a 10% equity interest in Hilton House from Trafalgar Director, Paul Elliott, a commercial property located in central Stockport, Manchester, for a purchase price of \u00a3350,000. The consideration for the 10% interest in Hilton House was satisfied through a combination of equity issuance and a convertible loan note as noted in the 31 March 2025 accounts. As of the reporting date, 366,666,667 ordinary shares at \u00a30.0003 amounting to \u00a3110,000 were issued to the vendor as partial consideration of the acquisition. The balance of \u00a3240,000 was recognised in the balance sheet pending the issuance of the convertible loan note.\n-\nThe Company was pleased to announce that Wager Holdings Limited (\"Wager\") invested \u00a350,000 by way of direct subscription (the \"Subscription\") of 500,000,000 new ordinary shares of \u00a30.0001 each in the capital of the Company (the \"Subscription Shares\"), at a price of \u00a30.0001 per share (the \"Issue Price\" during the period. In addition to the Subscription, Trafalgar created 150,000 \u00a31 unsecured interest free convertible loan notes (\"CLNs\") and enter into a formal agreement to issue those 150,000 CLNs for a subscription value of \u00a3150,000 (the \"Wager CLN\") from Wager. Of this CLN, \u00a3100,000 has so far been drawn down. These fund were used primarily to fund working capital requirements.\nPaul Treadaway\nChief Executive\n15 December 2025\nTRAFALGAR PROPERTY GROUP PLC\nCONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED INTERIM RESULTS FOR THE\nSIX MONTHS ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2025\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n6 month\nperiod ended\n30 September 2025\n(Unaudited)\n6 month\nperiod ended\n30 September 2024\n(Unaudited)\nYear\nended\n31 March\n2025\n(Audited)\nNote\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nRevenue\n715\n1\n1\nCost of sales\n(743)\n-\n(132)\nGross (loss)/profit\n(28)\n1\n(131)\nAdministrative expenses\n(118)\n(192)\n(386)\nUnderlying operating (loss)\n(146)\n(191)\n(517)\nInterest income\n1\nOther income\n118\n136\nInterest payable and similar charges\n(9)\n(10)\n(20)\n(Loss) before taxation\n(155)\n(83)\n(400)\nTax payable on profit on ordinary activities\n5\n-\n-\n-\n(Loss) after taxation for the period/year\n(155)\n(83)\n(400)\nOther comprehensive income\nTotal comprehensive (loss) for the period/year\n(155)\n(83)\n(400)\n(Loss) attributable to:\nEquity holders of the parent\n(155)\n(83)\n(400)\nTotal comprehensive (loss) for the period/yearattributable to:\nEquity holders of the parent\n(155)\n(83)\n(400)\n(LOSS) PER ORDINARY SHARE;\nBasic/Diluted\n6\n(0.01)p\n(0.01)p\n(0.05)p\nAll results in the current and preceding financial period derive from continuing operations.\nTRAFALGAR PROPERTY GROUP PLC\nCONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED INTERIM RESULTS FOR THE\nSIX MONTHS ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2025\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\n30 September 2025\n(Unaudited)\n30 September 2024\n(Unaudited)\n31 March\n2025\n(Audited)\nNote\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nNon-current assets\nTangible fixed assets\n-\n1\n-\n-\n1\n-\nCurrent assets\nInventory\n844\n1,386\n1,310\nInvestment properties\n7\n350\n-\n-\nTrade and other receivables\n142\n155\n65\nCash at bank and in hand\n63\n53\n28\n1,399\n1,594\n1,403\nTotal assets\n1,399\n1,595\n1,403\nEQUITIES AND LIABILITIES\nCurrent liabilities\nTrade and other payables\n479\n237\n348\nBorrowings\n577\n981\n966\n1,056\n1,218\n1,314\nNon-current liabilities\nBorrowings\n3,476\n3,298\n3,227\nTotal liabilities\n4,532\n4,516\n4,541\nEquity attributable to equity holders of the Company\nCalled up share capital\n8 & 9\n3,347\n3,237\n3,260\nShare premium account\n4,286\n4,136\n4,213\nLoan note equity\n-\n-\n-\nReverse acquisition reserve\n(2,818)\n(2,818)\n(2,818)\nCapital contribution reserve\n10\n400\n400\n400\nProfit and loss account\n(8,348)\n(7,876)\n(8,193)\nTotal Equity\n(3,133)\n(2,921)\n(3,138)\nTotal Equity and Liabilities\n1,399\n1,595\n1,403\nTRAFALGAR PROPERTY GROUP PLC\nCONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED INTERIM RESULTS FOR THE\nSIX MONTHS ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2025\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nShare capital\nShare premium\nReverse acquisition reserve\nRetained profits\n/(losses)\nCapital contribution reserve\nTotal equity\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nAt 1 April 2025\n3,260\n4,213\n(2,818)\n(8,193)\n400\n(3,138)\nLoss for the period\n(155)\n(155)\nTotal comprehensive loss for the period\n(155)\n(155)\nIssuance of shares for the period\n87\n73\nAt 30 September 2025\n3,347\n4,286\n(2,818)\n(8,348)\n400\n(3,133)\nFor the purpose of preparing the consolidated financial statement of the Group, the share capital represents the nominal value of the issued share capital of 0.01p per share.

GENERAL INFORMATION\nThis financial information is for Trafalgar Property Group Plc (\"the Company\") and its subsidiary undertakings. The Company is incorporated in England and Wales.\n2. BASIS OF PREPARATION\nThe interim consolidated financial information has been prepared with regard to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted for use in the United Kingdom (UK IFRS) and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 that are relevant to companies, which report in accordance with IFRS. The interim financial information incorporates the results for the Group for the six month period from 1 April 2025 to 30 September 2025. The results for the year ended 31 March 2025 have been extracted from the statutory financial statements for the Group for the year ended 31 March 2025. The financial information set out in these interim consolidated financial information does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in S434 of the Companies Act 2006. They do not include all of the information required for full annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2025, which contained an unqualified audit report and have been filed with the Registrar of Companies. They did not contain statements under S498 of the Companies Act 2006.\nThe same accounting policies, presentation and methods of computation have been followed in these unaudited interim financial statements as those which were applied in the preparation of the group's annual financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2025.\nThe interim consolidated financial information incorporates the financial statements of Trafalgar Property Group Plc and its subsidiaries.\nThe interim financial information for the six months ended 30 September 2025 was approved by the Directors on 15 December 2025.\n3. SEGMENTAL REPORTING\nFor the purpose of IFRS 8, the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") takes the form of the Board of Directors. The Directors' opinion of the business of the Group is that the principal activity of the Group was residential property development and there is considered to be one reportable geographical segment, that of property development carried on in the UK. The internal and external reporting is on a consolidated basis with transactions between Group companies eliminated on consolidation. Therefore, the financial information of the single segment is the same as that set out in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity, the consolidated statement of financial position and cash-flows.\n4. MISCELLANEOUS INCOME\nThe write off of \u00a3Nil (2024: \u00a3118,000) relates to part of the amount received from Ecap Esports Ltd used in the period to cover direct costs associated with the proposed reverse takeover as stated in Note 20 of the year end accounts to 31 March 2025. The balance remaining at 30 September 2025 was \u00a323,965.\n5.

CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION RESERVE\nThe capital contribution reserve of \u00a3400,147 related to the renegotiation of interest accruing on loans to Mr G Howard - a related party in the year to 31 March 2025. Interest has reduced from 10% pa to 5% pa for the entire term of the loans and is now non compound. However, interest has been paid on one loan of \u00a3100,000 at the rate of 10% pa and this has not been affected and continues to be paid monthly.\n11. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nOn 16 October 2025, further to the Company's announcement on 16 July 2025, regarding the proposed issue to Wager Holdings Limited (\"Wager\") of up to 150,000 unsecured, interest-free \u00a31 convertible loan notes (the \"Wager CLN\") to fund working capital, Trafalgar announced that it had drawn down 100,000 Wager CLNs for gross proceeds of \u00a3100,000.\nThe drawdown had been made on the terms described in the 16 July 2025 announcement, including (among other things): (i) maturity on or before 31 December 2025; (ii) interest-free and unsecured; (iii) convertible at \u00a30.0001 per Ordinary Share; and (iv) transferable and unquoted. Any conversion remains subject to the restriction that, immediately following conversion, Wager (together with persons acting in concert, as defined in the Takeover Code) shall not hold 29.9% or more of the Company's voting rights, subject to limited exceptions.\nUse of proceeds\nThe proceeds were applied primarily to the Group's working capital requirements.\nFacility headroom\nFollowing this drawdown, \u00a350,000 of the \u00a3150,000 Wager CLN facility remains available to be drawn.\nAdmission and total voting rights\nNo new Ordinary Shares were issued in connection with this drawdown. The Company's issued share capital was therefore unchanged. A further announcement will be made in due course should any CLNs be converted into new Ordinary Shares.\nAs Wager Limited is a substantial shareholder in the Company, the issue of the CLN constitutes a related party transaction under Rule 13 of the AIM Rules for Companies. The Directors of Trafalgar, all of whom are independent in respect of the related party transaction, having consulted with SPARK, the Company's Nominated Adviser, consider that the issuance and terms of CLN are fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's Shareholders are concerned.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Of course, the Board cannot predict the future but aims to make decisions that it considers are in the best interest of all shareholders at the time.\nThe Board engages with its stakeholders in a number of pre-planned ways, these include; review meetings with our brokers and advisors, shareholders have the ability to email the Company directly and the Board will reply to questions within the regulatory limits, the Company issues RNS communications on a regular basis and the Company's web site is continuously updated to inform our stakeholders. The Company's annual report is also an opportunity to update our stakeholders.\nOur employees are one of the primary assets of our business and will be critical to the future success of the Company. First and foremost, the Directors strive to ensure a safe working environment for all its staff and contractors, and we are proud of our safety achievements in 2024/25. We also seek to reward employees with remuneration packages which align the interests of the Company and its shareholders with those of the employees. Employees are also provided with challenging work and external training opportunities to ensure their continual development.\nThe Directors believe they have acted in the way they consider most likely to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its members as a whole, as required by Section 172 (1) of the Companies Act 2006.\nK\ney per\nfo\nr\nm\na\nnce in\nd\nic\nato\nrs\n(K\nP\nIs\n)\nM\na\nn\na\ng\ne\nm\ne\nn\nt a\nr\ne cl\no\ns\ne\nl\ny\ni\nn\nv\no\nl\nv\ned in\nt\nh\ne\nd\na\ny to\nd\na\ny\nop\ne\nr\nati\no\nn\ns\no\nf t\nh\ne G\nro\nu\np a\nn\nd constantly monitor c\na\ns\nh\nf\nl\no\nw\ns a\nn\nd e\nx\np\ne\nn\nd\ni\nt\nu\nr\ne.

The balance of \u00a3240,000 will be satisfied through the issue of an unsecured CLN at \u00a30.0003 strike price.\nLater in July Wager Holdings Ltd invested \u00a350,000 by way of a direct subscription of 500,000,000 new ordinary shares at \u00a30.0001 each. This cash was used for working capital purposes. In addition to the subscription, Trafalgar will create \u00a3150,000 of unsecured CLN's with Wager to fund working capital, which will be drawn down in tranches and the conversion restricted to ensure the CLN holder does not breach the 29.9% or more of the voting rights.\nPr\nov\ni\ns\ni\no\nn\no\nf inf\no\nr\nm\nat\ni\no\nn\nt\no\na\nu\nd\nit\no\nr\nEa\nc\nh\no\nf t\nh\ne\np\ne\nr\ns\non\ns\nw\nh\no a\nr\ne\nD\nire\nc\nt\nor\ns at t\nh\ne t\ni\nm\ne\nw\nh\ne\nn t\nh\nis Di\nr\ne\nc\nt\nor\ns\n'\nR\ne\npor\nt is a\np\npro\nv\ned\nh\nas c\non\nf\ni\nr\nm\ned t\nh\nat:\n\u00b7\ns\no\nf\nar\na\ns\nt\nh\nat\nD\nire\nc\nt\no\nr is\na\nw\na\nr\ne, t\nh\ne\nr\ne\ni\ns\nn\no\nr\nele\nv\na\nn\nt\na\nu\nd\nit\ni\nn\nf\no\nr\nm\nati\no\nn\no\nf\nw\nh\ni\nc\nh\nt\nh\ne G\nro\nu\np'\ns a\nu\nd\nit\no\nr\ni\ns\nun\na\nw\na\nr\ne; a\nn\nd\n\u00b7\nt\nh\nat Di\nr\ne\nc\nt\no\nr\nh\nas t\na\nk\ne\nn all\nt\nh\ne\ns\nte\np\ns t\nh\nat\no\nu\ng\nh\nt to\nh\na\nv\ne\nb\ne\ne\nn ta\nk\nen\na\ns a Di\nr\ne\nc\nt\no\nr in\nord\ner\nt\no\nb\ne a\nw\na\nr\ne\no\nf a\nn\ny\ni\nn\nf\no\nr\nm\nati\no\nn\nn\ne\ne\nded\nb\ny\nt\nh\ne G\nro\nu\np\n'\ns\na\nu\nd\nit\no\nr in c\no\nnn\ne\nc\nti\no\nn\nw\ni\nt\nh\npr\ne\np\na\nr\ni\nn\ng\nt\nh\neir\nr\ne\npor\nt\na\nn\nd to esta\nb\nli\ns\nh t\nh\nat\nt\nh\ne G\nro\nu\np'\ns a\nu\nd\nit\no\nr is\na\nwa\nr\ne\no\nf t\nh\ne i\nn\nf\no\nr\nm\na\nt\ni\no\nn\n.\nAud\ni\nto\nr\nThe auditor, MHA, previously traded through the legal entity MacIntyre Hudson LLP.

For the purposes of the table on pages 13 to 15 that sets out the key audit matters and how our audit addressed the key audit matters, the terms \"we\" and \"our\" refer to MHA. The Group financial statements, as defined below, consolidate the accounts of Trafalgar Property Group plc and its subsidiaries (the \"Group\"). The \"Parent Company\" is defined as Trafalgar Property Group plc, as an individual entity. The relevant legislation governing the Company is the United Kingdom Companies Act 2006 (\"Companies Act 2006\").\nOpinion\nWe have audited the financial statements of Trafalgar Property Group plc for the year ended 31 March 2025.\nThe financial statements that we have audited comprise:\n\u00b7\nthe Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income\n\u00b7\nthe Consolidated Statement of Financial Position\n\u00b7\nthe Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity\n\u00b7\nthe Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows\n\u00b7\nNotes 1 to 20 to the consolidated financial statements, including material accounting policies\n\u00b7\nthe Company Balance Sheet\n\u00b7\nthe Company Statement of Changes in Equity and\n\u00b7\nNotes 1 to 15 to the Company financial statements, including material accounting policies.\nThe financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted in the United Kingdom (\"UK adopted IFRS\"). The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 'The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland' (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).\nIn our opinion, the financial statements:\n\u00b7\ngive a true and fair view of the state of the Group's and of the Parent Company's affairs as at 31 March 2025 and of the Group's loss for the year then ended;\n\u00b7\nthe group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK adopted IFRS;\n\u00b7\nthe parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and\n\u00b7\nhave been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\nBasis for opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\nMaterial uncertainty related to going concern\nWe draw your attention to page 23 Going Concern section in the financial statements which sets out the directors' assessment of the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. The note explains that the Group has secured post-year-end funding, including proceeds from the sale of the Speldhurst property, which resulted in a partial extinguishment of outstanding mortgages, and a new longer-term facility to support the ongoing development of the Talbot Park project. Additional working capital funding was also secured through equity subscription and a convertible loan note entered into with an unconnected third party. The directors have also received a letter of support from a Director, C C Johnson, indicating his willingness to provide funding to the Group over the next twelve months from the date of signature of the financial statements. However, as this support is not legally binding, and given the ongoing uncertainty over the timing of future sales, access to additional funding, and the reliance on further financing from directors or third parties, the directors have concluded that a material uncertainty exists that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. Our audit opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.\nOur evaluation of the Directors' assessment of the Group's and the Parent Company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n\u2022 The consideration of inherent risks to the Group's and Parent company's current operations and established business model.\n\u2022 The evaluation of how those risks might impact on the Group's and Parent company's available financial resources.\n\u2022 Review of the mathematical accuracy of the cash flow forecast prepared by management and corroboration of key data inputs to supporting documentation for consistency of assumptions used with our knowledge obtained during the audit.\n\u2022 Challenging management for reasonableness of assumptions in respect of the timing and quantum of cash receipts and payments included in the cash flow forecast.\n\u2022 Holding discussions with management regarding future financing plans, and assessing the probability and likelihood of their availability and their impact on the cash flow forecast.\n\u2022 Evaluating the accuracy of historical forecasts against actual results to ascertain the accuracy of management's forecasts.\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.\nOverview of our audit approach\nScope\nOur Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including the Group's system of internal control, and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. We also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including assessing whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that may have represented a risk of material misstatement.\nThe Group consists of seven reporting components\n.\nBased on our risk assessment and understanding of the Group, we identified two components - Trafalgar Property Group plc and Trafalgar New Homes Limited - as significant due to their financial significance and their susceptibility to risks of material misstatement. These components were subject to full scope audits performed by the group engagement team to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence in relation to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn determining the audit scope for other components, we considered both quantitative and qualitative factors, including the nature of activities, inherent risks, and our assessment of the risk of material misstatement at the group level.\nAs a result, audit of specified classes of transactions, account balances, and disclosures (COTABDs) were performed for four components: Trafalgar Retirement+ Limited, Selmat Limited, Combe Bank Homes (Oakhurst) Ltd and Combe Homes (Borough Green) Ltd. Specified audit procedures were performed on the remaining component: Life Hydroponics Limited.\nAll audit procedures were performed by the group engagement team. The group audit strategy, scope and procedures were designed to ensure that audit evidence was obtained in relation to all components contributing to the Group's financial position and performance. Our approach ensured appropriate audit coverage over components representing the Group's principal business activities and areas of assessed risk.\nOverall Materiality\n2025\n2024\nGroup\n\u00a330,000\n\u00a328,000\n1% of net liabilities (2024: 1% of net liabilities)\nParent Company\n\u00a36,200\n\u00a34,900\n2% of gross liabilities (2024: 2% of gross liabilities)\nKey audit matters\nRecurring\n\u00b7\nUndisclosed related party transactions\nKey Audit Matters\nKey Audit Matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those matters which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. In addition to the matter described in the Material Uncertainty related to going concern section, we have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.\nUndisclosed related party transactions\nKey audit\nmatter description\nThe Group and the Parent Company enters into a significant number of transactions with related parties, both intra-group transactions and with individuals related to the Group.\nThere is a risk that transactions (particularly any transactions which are not at arm's length) and balances with related parties are undisclosed or misclassified.\nHow the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter\nOur audit work in this area included the following procedures:\n\u00b7\nIdentifying the risk of material misstatement due to incomplete or inaccurate disclosure and classification of related party transactions and relationships, particularly where such transactions are not conducted on an arm's length basis.\n\u00b7\nObtaining management's record of related parties - who they are, the nature of these relationships, whether any related party transactions have been entered into in the year and the nature of those transactions.\n.\n\u00b7\nWe performed independent searches of the Board of Directors' other appointments and shareholdings and to identify any counterparties on the list which were not included in the related party disclosures.\n\u00b7\nWe reviewed the movement on these balances during the year and examined underlying transactions by interrogating the purchase ledger, sales ledger, and general ledger to identify entries involving related parties. Where applicable, we utilised data analytics tools to assist in identifying potential related party transactions. Selected transactions and balance movements were then vouched to supporting evidence to assess completeness and accuracy of disclosure.\n\u00b7\nWe reviewed the minutes of meetings of the board of directors to identify any undisclosed related party relationships.\n\u00b7\nWe discussed with management the nature and purpose of these items and considered whether disclosure sufficiently addressed these matters.\n\u00b7\nIn addition, we obtained written confirmation of the balances from all disclosed parties and confirmed key terms to agreements.\nKey observations\nNothing has come to our attention which indicates that related party transactions and balances are incomplete.\nOur application of materiality\nOur definition of materiality considers the value of error or omission on the financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, would change or influence the economic decision of a reasonably knowledgeable user of those financial statements. Misstatements below these levels will not necessarily be evaluated as immaterial as we also take account of the nature of identified misstatements, and the particular circumstances of their occurrence, when evaluating their effect on the financial statements as a whole. Materiality is used in planning the scope of our work, executing that work and evaluating the results.\nPerformance materiality is the application of materiality at the individual account or balance level, set at an amount to reduce, to an appropriately low level, the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality for the financial statements as a whole.\nThe determination of performance materiality reflects our assessment of the risk of undetected errors existing, the nature of the systems and controls and the level of misstatements arising in previous audits.\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:\nGroup financial statements\nParent Company financial statements\nOverall materiality\n\u00a330,000 (2024: \u00a328,000)\n\u00a36,200 (2024: \u00a34,900)\nHow we determined it\n1% of net liabilities (2024: 1% of net liabilities)\n2% of gross liabilities (2024: 2% of gross liabilities)\nRationale for the benchmark applied\nGiven the Group have liquidated the majority of its cash generating assets and has only limited trading activity, traditional benchmarks such as revenue or profit before tax are no longer considered appropriate. In this context, we consider the net liability position of the Group to be the main measure by which the users of the financial statements assess the prospects and success of the Group. Therefore, we consider this to be the most appropriate benchmark for Group materiality.\nThe Parent Company is primarily a holding company incurring limited costs and financing the group. As a result of historic losses and the impairment of investments, traditional benchmarks such as revenue or profit before tax are not considered appropriate. In this context, we consider the Parent Company's gross liabilities to be the most appropriate benchmark for determining materiality. This reflects the significance of the Company's financial position, particularly the level of deficit, which is likely to be a key focus for users of the financial statements in assessing the Company's solvency and going concern status.\nPerformance materiality\n\u00a318,000 (2024: \u00a316,800) which represents 60% (2024: 60%) of overall materiality.\n\u00a33,700 (2024: \u00a32,940) which represents 60% (2024: 60%) of overall materiality.\nWe agreed to report any corrected or uncorrected adjustments exceeding \u00a31,500 (2024: \u00a31,400) for the Group and \u00a3310 (2024: \u00a3245) for the Parent Company respectively to the Board of Directors as well as differences below this threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.\nOverview of the scope of the Group and Parent Company audits\nOur assessment of audit risk, evaluation of materiality and our determination of performance materiality sets our audit scope for each company within the Group. In accordance with ISA (UK) 600 (Revised), we adopted a risk-based approach to designing our audit strategy, including an analysis of significant COTABDs to determine the nature, timing and extent of work required across the Group.\nThe Group comprises seven UK-based components. We identified two components-Trafalgar Property Group plc and Trafalgar New Homes Limited-as significant due to their contribution to the Group's financial position and performance, as well as their associated audit risks. These components were subject to full scope audits, performed by the Group audit team.\nFor four further components, the Group audit team performed audit procedures on specific COTABDs assessed as material to the Group financial statements. For the remaining component, we performed substantive analytical procedures. This approach ensured audit coverage over components contributing 100% of the Group's total assets, total liabilities, and loss before tax.\nThe table below summarises the audit work performed at each category of component and the proportion of the Group's financial metrics covered by our procedures:\nNumber of components\nRevenue\nTotal assets\nTotal liabilities\nLoss before tax\nFull scope audit\n2\nN/A\n70%\n82%\n97%\nAudit of specified COTABDs\n4\nN/A\n30%\n18%\n2%\nSpecified audit Procedures\n1\nN/A\n0%\n0%\n1%\nTotal\n7\nN/A\n100%\n100%\n100%\nThe control environment\nWe evaluated the design and implementation of those internal controls of the Group,\nincluding the Parent Company, which are relevant to our audit, such as those relating to the financial reporting cycle.\nClimate-related risks\nIn planning our audit and gaining an understanding of the Group and Parent Company, we considered the potential impact of climate-related risks on the business and its financial statements, and it was concluded that climate- related risks are not material to these financial statements\nReporting on other information\nThe other information comprises the information included in the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements, or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\nStrategic report and directors' report\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:\n\u00b7\nthe information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors' Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and\n\u00b7\nthe Strategic Report and the Directors' Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\nIn the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Parent Company and their environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors' report.\nMatters on which we are required to report by exception\nWe have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\u00b7\nadequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received by branches not visited by us; or\n\u00b7\nthe parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\n\u00b7\ncertain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or\n\u00b7\nwe have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.\nResponsibilities of directors\nAs explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement, as set out on page 9, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group's and the Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\nAuditor responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.\nMisstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\nA further description of our responsibilities for the financial statements is located on the FRC's website at:\nwww.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities\n. This description forms part of our auditor's report.\nExtent to which the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud.\nThese audit procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements were free from fraud or error. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error and detecting irregularities that result from fraud is inherently more difficult than detecting those that result from error, as fraud may involve collusion, deliberate concealment, forgery or intentional misrepresentations. Also, the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely we would become aware of it.\nIdentifying and assessing potential risks arising from irregularities, including fraud\nThe extent of the procedures undertaken to identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud, included the following:\n\u00b7\nWe considered the nature of the industry and sector, the control environment, business performance including remuneration policies and the Group's, including the Parent Company's, own risk assessment that irregularities might occur as a result of fraud or error. From our sector experience and through discussion with the directors, we obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks applicable to the Group focusing on laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a direct material effect on the financial statements, such as provisions of the Companies Act 2006, or those that had a fundamental effect on the operations of the Group.\n\u00b7\nWe enquired of the directors and management concerning the Group's and the Parent Company's policies and procedures relating to:\n-\nidentifying, evaluating and complying with the laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances of non-compliance;\n-\ndetecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they had any knowledge of actual or suspected fraud; and\n-\nthe internal controls established to mitigate risks related to fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations.\n\u00b7\nWe discussed among the engagement team regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and any potential indicators of fraud.\n\u00b7\nWe assessed the susceptibility of the financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by evaluating management's incentives and opportunities for manipulation of the financial statements. This included utilising the spectrum of inherent risk and an evaluation of the risk of management override of controls. We determined that the principal risks were related to posting inappropriate journal entries to reduce costs, creating fictitious transactions to hide losses or to improve financial performance, and management bias in any accounting estimates.\nAudit response to risks identified\nIn respect of the above procedures:\n\u00b7\nwe corroborated the results of our enquiries through our review of the minutes of the Group's and the Parent Company's board meetings and enquiries of management regarding any ongoing legal cases;\n\u00b7\naudit procedures performed by the engagement team in connection with the risks identified included:\n-\nPerforming audit work over the risk of management override of controls, including testing of journal entries and other adjustments for appropriateness, evaluating the business rationale of significant transactions outside the normal course of business, and reviewing accounting estimates for bias.\n-\nReviewing financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\n-\nChallenging assumptions and judgements made by management in their significant accounting estimates.\n\u00b7\nthe Senior Statutory Auditor considered the experience and expertise of the engagement team to ensure that the team had the appropriate competence and capabilities; and\n\u00b7\nwe communicated relevant laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team members and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout the audit.\nUse of our report\nThis report is made solely to the Parent Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Parent Company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Parent Company and the Parent Company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\nSimon Knibbs MA FCA (Senior Statutory Auditor)\nfor and on behalf of MHA, Statutory Auditor\nLondon, United Kingdom\n21 October 2025\nMHA is the trading

The reserve relates to a reverse acquisition between the Company and Combe Bank Homes Ltd (CBH) on 11/11/2011 via a share for share exchange. This reserve arises as a result of the elimination of the Plc's investment in CBH resulting in the shareholders of PLC becoming majority shareholders in the enlarged group.\nR\neta\ni\nn\ned\npro\nf\nit/(\nl\no\nss\nes) are the cumulative net gains and losses less distributions made and items of other comprehensive income not accumulated in another separate reserve.\nLoan note equity reserve relates to the equity portion of the convertible loan notes and is the amount that has been provided for in respect of the difference between the cash value and the liability element of the loan notes. The remaining balance has been reversed following the conversion of the Loan Note in 2024.\nCapital contribution reserve arises due to amounts waived in respect of previously accrued interest on shareholders or related party loan accounts. Capital contribution reserves are shown in note 17.\nFurther details of shares issues in the year are shown in note 14.\nT\nh\ne\nn\no\ntes\no\nn\np\na\ng\nes\n30\nto\n42\na\nr\ne an i\nn\nt\ne\ng\nr\nal\np\na\nr\nt\no\nf t\nh\nese c\no\nns\no\nli\nd\nated\nf\ni\nn\na\nn\ncial\ns\nta\nt\ne\nm\ne\nn\nt\ns.\n2025\n2024\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nC\na\ns\nh\nf\nl\no\nw\nf\nr\no\nm\no\nper\nat\ning\na\nc\nt\ni\nv\nities\n(\nL\no\nss\n)\na\nf\nter ta\nx\nati\no\nn\n(400,266)\n(516,723)\nDe\np\nr\ne\nc\niati\no\nn\n160\n213\n(In\ncr\ne\na\ns\ne) in\ni\nnv\ne\nn\nt\no\nr\ny\n(534,695)\n(457,578)\nDecrease/(Increase) in\nr\ne\nc\nei\nv\na\nb\nl\ne\ns\n14,226\n(45,543)\nIncrease\nin\np\na\ny\na\nb\nl\ne\ns\n198,785\n62,751\nEcap Esports Ltd loan written off in the year (Note 2)\n(136,300)\n-\nLoan note equity movement\n-\n(107,204)\nImpairment of plant and equipment\n-\n25,000\nInterest income\n(766)\n-\nI\nn\nte\nr\nest\np\na\ny\na\nb\nle a\nn\nd\ns\ni\nm\ni\nlar c\nh\na\nr\ng\nes\n20,369\n129,333\nNet c\na\ns\nh\no\nut\nf\nl\no\nw\nf\nr\no\nm\no\nper\na\nt\ning\na\nc\nt\ni\nv\nities\n(838,487)\n(909,751)\nInvesting activities:\nDisposal\no\nf\ninvestment property\n-\n927,249\nInterest received\n766\n-\nNet cash from investing activities\n766\n927,249\nFinancing activities:\nI\nssu\ne\no\nf\nsh\na\nr\ne\ns (net of costs)\n99,550\n1,028,575\nN\ne\nw l\no\na\nn\nborro\nw\ni\nn\ng\ns\n1,243,750\n741,975\nR\ne\np\naid l\no\nan\nborro\nw\ni\nn\ng\ns\n(711,657)\n(1,066,530)\nR\nelat\ne\nd\np\na\nr\nt\ny\nn\ne\nw l\no\na\nn\nborr\no\nw\ni\nn\ng\n704,970\n264,100\nR\nelat\ne\nd\np\na\nr\nt\ny l\no\nan\nr\ne\np\na\nym\ne\nn\nt\n(460,000)\n(971,731)\nI\nn\nte\nr\nest\np\naid\n(20,369)\n(22,129)\nNet cash inflow/(outflow) from financing\n856,244\n(25,740)\nIncrease/\n(d\ne\nc\nr\nea\ns\ne) in c\na\ns\nh\na\nnd c\na\ns\nh equiv\na\nlents in\nt\nhe\ny\ne\na\nr\n18,523\n(8,242)\nC\na\ns\nh\na\nnd c\na\ns\nh e\nq\nuiv\na\nlents\na\nt\nt\nhe be\ng\nin\nn\ning\no\nf\nt\nhe\ny\ne\na\nr\n8,906\n17,148\nC\na\ns\nh\na\nnd c\na\ns\nh e\nq\nuiv\na\nlents\na\nt\nt\nhe end\no\nf\nt\nhe\ny\ne\na\nr\n27,429\n8,906\nT\nh\ne\nn\no\ntes\no\nn\np\na\ng\nes\n30\nto 42 a\nr\ne an inte\ng\nr\nal\np\na\nr\nt\no\nf t\nh\ne\ns\ne c\no\nn\ns\no\nli\nd\nated\nf\ni\nn\na\nn\ncial\ns\ntat\ne\nm\ne\nn\nt\ns\n.\nB\nA\nSIS\nO\nF\nA\nC\nC\nOUN\nT\nI\nNG\nT\nh\nese\nf\ni\nn\na\nn\nci\na\nl stat\ne\nm\ne\nn\nts a\nr\ne\nf\no\nr\nT\nr\na\nf\nal\ng\nar\nP\nrop\ne\nr\nty G\nro\nu\np\nP\nlc\n(\n\"\nt\nh\ne\nC\no\nm\np\na\nn\ny\n\")\na\nn\nd its\ns\nu\nb\ns\ni\nd\nia\nr\ny\nun\nd\ne\nr\nt\na\nk\ni\nn\ng\ns\n(\n'\nt\nh\ne G\nro\nu\np\n'\n)\n.\nT\nh\ne\nC\no\nm\np\na\nn\ny is a\np\nu\nb\nlic c\no\nm\np\na\nn\ny\n, l\ni\nm\nited\nb\ny\ns\nh\na\nr\nes\ndomiciled a\nn\nd i\nn\nc\norpor\nated\ni\nn E\nn\ng\nl\na\nn\nd a\nn\nd\nW\nales.\n(Co\nm\np\na\nn\ny\nnu\nm\nb\ner\ni\ns\n0\n4\n3\n4012\n5\n)\n.

At the date of issue, the fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt. The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible loan notes and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Group, is included in equity. Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible loan notes based on their relative carrying amounts at the date of issue. The portion relating to the equity component is charged directly against equity. The interest expense on the liability component is calculated by applying the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt to the liability component of the instrument. The difference between this amount and the interest paid is added to the carrying amount of the convertible loan note.\nSha\nr\ne c\nap\nit\na\nl\nO\nrd\ni\nn\na\nr\ny\ns\nh\na\nr\ne c\nap\nital is cla\ns\ns\ni\nf\nied as e\nq\nu\nit\ny\n.\nI\nn\nte\nr\ni\nm\nord\ni\nn\na\nr\ny\nd\ni\nv\ni\nd\ne\nn\nd\ns a\nr\ne\nr\ne\nco\ngn\ni\ns\ne\nd\nw\nh\ne\nn\np\naid a\nn\nd\nf\ni\nn\nal\nord\ni\nn\na\nr\ny\nd\ni\nv\ni\nd\ne\nn\nd\ns a\nr\ne\nr\ne\nco\ng\nn\ni\ns\ned\nwhen they are authorized and are no longer at the discretion of the entity and\nas a lia\nb\nili\nt\ny\ni\nn\nt\nh\ne\ny\ne\na\nr in\nw\nh\ni\nc\nh t\nh\ne\ny a\nr\ne a\nppro\nv\ne\nd\n.\nDeferred shares were created as part of a subdivision of shares but carry no voting rights and no right to participate in the profits of the company.\nI\nm\npa\ni\nr\nme\nn\nt\no\nf fi\nnan\nc\ni\na\nl\na\nss\nets\nIFRS 9 offers two approaches for measuring and recognizing the loss allowance: General and Simplified.

This generated net proceeds of \u00a394,500 following the repayment of associated third party loans and professional fees.\nOn 1 July 2025, the Group has announced that it has acquired, from Trafalgar Director, P R Elliott (the \"Vendor\"), a 10% equity interest in Hilton House, a commercial property located in central Stockport, Manchester, for a purchase price of \u00a3350,000. This acquisition constitutes a substantial transaction under AIM Rule 12. The consideration for the 10% interest in Hilton House is to be satisfied through a combination of equity issuance (the \"Equity Issuance\") and a convertible loan note (the \"Convertible Loan Note\" or \"CLN\"), comprising:\n\u00b7\nAn initial Equity Issuance of 366,666,667 new ordinary shares in Trafalgar at \u00a30.0003 per share, amounting to \u00a3110,000 (\"Consideration Shares\"). This will result in the Vendor holding 29.43% of the fully diluted issued share capital of Trafalgar.\n\u00b7\nThe balance of \u00a3240,000 will be satisfied through the issue of an unsecured CLN, convertible at the same \u00a30.0003 strike price. Conversion of the CLN will be subject to shareholder approval, in the event any proposed conversion results in the Vendor increasing its shareholding in Trafalgar above 29.9%.\nHilton House, independently valued at \u00a33.5 million, is currently a vacant office building which comprises a 1970's-built office complex consisting of four interlinked blocks, including three 3-storey buildings and one 8-storey building, encircled by 68 parking spaces. The property has the potential for redevelopment into a residential buy-to-let scheme, subject to future planning consents. The transaction provides the Company exposure to potential uplift from the repositioning of the asset into a residential or mixed-used scheme, subject to future planning consents. The 10% equity interest will give Trafalgar rights to 10% of any future potential rental income derived from Hilton House and 10% of the sale proceeds on any future disposal of the site.\nOn 16 July 2025, the Group announced that Wager Holdings Limited (\"Wager\") has invested \u00a350,000 by way of direct subscription (the \"Subscription\") of 500,000,000 new ordinary shares of \u00a30.0001 each in the capital of the Company (the \"Subscription Shares\"), at a price of \u00a30.0001 per share (the \"Issue Price\"). The Subscription will be used primarily to fund working capital requirements.\nIn addition to the Subscription, Trafalgar create 150,000 \u00a31 unsecured interest free convertible loan notes (\"CLNs\") and entered into a formal agreement to issue those 150,000 CLNs for a subscription value of \u00a3150,000 (the \"Wager CLN\") from Wager. It is intended that the Wager CLN will also be used primarily to fund working capital requirements.\nThe key terms of the Wager CLN are:\n- up to \u00a3150,000 total facility (principal) amount.\n- repayable on or before 31 December 2025.\n- interest free and unsecured.\n- convertible at \u00a30.0001, being a discount of 71.43% to the closing mid-market share price on 14 July, being \u00a30.00035\n- transferrable and will not be quoted.\nThe conversion of the CLN would be restricted to ensure that, immediately following such conversion, the new fully paid shares issued to the CLN holder, together with any shares already held by the CLN holder and persons acting in concert (as defined in the Takeover Code), do not carry in aggregate 29.9% or more of the voting rights of the Company. Exceptions to this restriction include conversion as part of a sale of the entire issued share capital of the Company, conversion with Takeover Panel approval or conversion as part of a mandatory offer for the remaining shares in the Company, under Rule 9 of the Takeover Code.\nAt the date of these financial statements \u00a3100,000 had been drawn down.\nN\not\ne\n2025\n2024\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nNon-Current Assets\nI\nnv\ne\ns\nt\nm\ne\nn\nt\ns\n7\n-\n-\nCurr\ne\nnt\na\nss\ne\nt\ns\nDe\nb\nt\nor\ns\n8\n51,454\n32,140\nC\na\ns\nh at\nb\na\nn\nk\na\nn\nd in\nh\na\nn\nd\n26,624\n3,406\n78,078\n35,546\nTOTAL ASSET\n78,078\n35,546\nEQUITIES & LIABILITIES\nCurrent liabilities\nTrade & other payables\n9\n264,937\n224,856\nNon-current liabilities\nBorrowings\n10\n48,965\n25,000\nTOTAL LIABILITIES\n313,902\n249,856\nNET (LIABILITIES)\n(235,824)\n(214,310)\nC\nalled\nu\np\ns\nh\na\nr\ne c\nap\nital\n12\n3,260,025\n3,237,400\nS\nh\na\nr\ne\npr\ne\nm\ni\nu\nm a\nc\nc\no\nun\nt\n4,213,165\n4,136,240\nProfit and loss account\n(7,709,014)\n(7,587,950)\nE\nq\nu\nity -\natt\nribut\na\nble\nt\no\nt\nhe\no\nw\nners\no\nf\nt\nhe P\na\nr\ne\nnt\n(235,824)\n(214,310)\nTOTAL EQUITY AND LIABILITIES\n78,078\n35,546\nT\nh\ne l\no\ns\ns\nf\no\nr t\nh\ne\nf\ni\nn\na\nn\ncial\ny\ne\na\nr\nd\ne\na\nlt\nw\ni\nt\nh\ni\nn t\nh\ne\nf\ni\nn\na\nn\ncial\ns\nt\na\nt\ne\nm\ne\nn\nts\no\nf t\nh\ne\nP\na\nr\ne\nn\nt\nC\no\nm\np\na\nn\ny\nw\na\ns \u00a3121,064\n(20\n24\n:\nl\no\ns\ns \u00a3339,191\n)\n.\nT\nh\ne\nf\ni\nn\na\nn\ncial\ns\ntat\ne\nm\ne\nn\nts\nw\ne\nr\ne a\nppro\nv\ned\nb\ny t\nh\ne\nBo\na\nr\nd\no\nf D\ni\nr\ne\nc\nt\nor\ns\no\nn 21 October 2025 a\nn\nd a\nu\nt\nh\nor\ni\ns\ned\nf\no\nr i\ns\ns\nu\ne a\nn\nd a\nr\ne\ns\ni\ngn\ned\no\nn its\nb\ne\nh\nalf\nb\ny\n:\nP\nA\nT\nr\ne\na\nd\na\nw\na\ny\n:\nPaul Treadaway\nG M Thorneycroft\n:\nGary Thorneycroft\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\n\u2026\nC\no\nm\np\na\nn\ny\nR\ne\ng\ni\ns\ntrati\no\nn\nN\nu\nm\nb\ne\nr\n:\n04\n3\n40\n1\n2\n5\nT\nh\ne\nn\no\ntes\no\nn\np\na\ng\nes\n45\nto\n52\nf\nor\nm\na\nn i\nn\nte\ng\nr\nal\np\na\nr\nt\no\nf t\nh\ne\ns\ne\nf\ni\nn\na\nn\nci\na\nl stat\ne\nm\ne\nn\nts\nShare\nShare\nLoan Note\nProfit\nTotal\nCapital\nPremium\nEquity\n& loss\nEquity\nReserve\naccount\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nAt 1 April 2023\n2,860,150\n3,484,915\n107,204\n(7,355,963)\n(903,694)\nLoss for the year\n-\n-\n-\n(339,191)\n(339,191)\nTotal comprehensive loss for the year\n-\n-\n-\n(339,191)\n(339,191)\nLoan Note Equity Reserve\n(107,204)\n107,204\n-\nShares issued during the year on conversion of loan notes\n226,250\n678,750\n-\n905,000\nShares issued during the year net of costs\n151,000\n(27,425)\n-\n123,575\nAt 31 March 2024\n3,237,400\n4,136,240\n-\n(7,587,950)\n(214,310)\nAt 1 April 2024\n3,237,400\n4,136,240\n-\n(7,587,950)\n(214,310)\nLoss for the year\n-\n-\n-\n(121,064)\n(121,064)\nTotal comprehensive loss for the year\n-\n-\n-\n(121,064)\n(121,064)\nShares issued during the year net of costs\n22,625\n76,925\n-\n-\n99,550\nAt 31 March 2025\n3,260,025\n4,213,165\n-\n(7,709,014)\n(235,824)\nFurther details of share capital are shown in Note 12 of Company financial Statements.\nLoan note equity reserve is the amount that has been provided for in respect of the difference between the cash value and the liability element of the loan notes.

The Subscription will be used primarily to fund working capital requirements. A CLN has also been entered into for \u00a3150,000 with Wager Holdings Ltd that will provide further working capital. At the date of these financial statements \u00a3100,000 had been drawn down.\nHowever, given that a degree of uncertainty exists in the timing of future sales, the Company's ability to raise further funds through share placements and the potential reliance on further funding been provided by C C Johnson, the directors and management's ability to refinance all loans due in the next twelve months, there exists a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.\n(b)\nI\nNV\nE\nS\nT\nM\nE\nN\nT\nS\nI\nnv\ne\ns\nt\nm\ne\nn\nt\ns\nh\neld

As a result, and as per the original terms of the 2024 CLN, the Company issued to C C Johnson 226,250,000 New Ordinary Shares (the \"2024 Conversion Shares\") at \u00a30.00044 per ordinary share (\"2024 CLN Exercise Price\").\nFurther to the announcement of 23 June 2025, the Company announced that it had acquired, from a Director of the Company, P R Elliott (the \"Vendor\"), a 10% equity interest in Hilton House, a commercial property located in central Stockport, Manchester, for a purchase price of \u00a3350,000. This acquisition constitutes a substantial transaction under AIM Rule 12. The consideration for the 10% interest in Hilton House is to be satisfied through a combination of equity issuance (the \"Equity Issuance\") and a convertible loan note (the \"Convertible Loan Note\" or \"CLN\"), comprising:\nA. An initial Equity Issuance of 366,666,667 new ordinary shares in the Company at \u00a30.0003 per share, amounting to \u00a3110,000 (\"Consideration Shares\").\nB. The balance of \u00a3240,000 will be satisfied through the issue of an unsecured CLN, convertible at the same \u00a30.0003 strike price. Conversion of the CLN will be subject to shareholder approval, in the event any proposed conversion results in the Vendor increasing its shareholding in Trafalgar above 29.9%.\nOn 16 July 2025 the Company announced that Wager Holdings Limited (\"Wager\") had invested \u00a350,000 by way of direct subscription (the \"Subscription\") of 500,000,000 new ordinary shares of \u00a30.0001 each in the capital of the Company (the \"Subscription Shares\"), at a price of \u00a30.0001 per share (the \"Issue Price\").\nDeferred Shares:\nOn 13 July 2020 the Company undertook a sub-division of its ordinary shares, which sub divided the 487,690,380 0.1p ordinary shares of 0.1p each into 487,690,380 ordinary shares of 0.01p each and 487,690,380 0.09p deferred shares of 0.09p each. The 0.09p deferred shares of 0.09p each were consolidated into deferred shares of 0.9p each ranking pari passu as one class with the existing deferred shares of 0.9p each.\nOn 04 November 2024, the Company undertook a sub-division of ordinary shares which subdivided the 653,102,371 0.1p ordinary shares into 653,102,371 0.01p and a new 653,102,371 deferred shares 0.09p each. The 0.09p deferred shares of 0.09p each were then consolidated into deferred shares of 0.9p each ranking pari passu as one class with the existing deferred shares of 0.9p each.\nDeferred shares do not entitle the holder to receive notice of and to attend or vote at any general meeting of the Company or to receive dividends or other distributions. Upon winding up or dissolution of the Company the holders of deferred shares shall be entitled to receive an amount equal to the nominal amount paid up thereon, but only after holders of ordinary shares have received \u00a3100,000 per ordinary share. Holders of deferred shares are not entitled to any further rights of participation in the assets of the Company. The Company has the right to purchase the deferred shares in issue at any time for no consideration.\n13.\nI\nN\nT\nE\nRC\nO\nM\nPANY\nT\nRANS\nA\nC\nTI\nO\nN\nS\nT\nh\ne C\no\nm\np\na\nn\ny\nh\nas ta\nk\nen a\nd\nv\na\nn\nt\na\ng\ne of\nt\nh\ne e\nx\ne\nm\np\nti\no\nn c\no\nn\nf\ne\nrr\ned by\nF\nR\nS\n10\n2 Secti\no\nn\n3\n3 \"Related\nP\na\nr\nt\ny di\ns\ncl\no\nsu\nr\nes\"\nn\no\nt to\nd\ni\ns\ncl\no\ns\ne tra\nns\na\nc\ntio\nn\ns\nun\nd\ne\nr\nt\na\nk\nen\nw\ni\nth\no\nt\nh\ner\nw\nh\no\nl\nl\ny o\nw\nn\ned\nm\ne\nm\nb\ne\nr\ns of\nt\nh\ne G\nro\nu\np.\nIn addition, there were no transactions with Forum Energy Services Ltd, the provider of a shareholders loan, as per note 10 of Company financial statements.\n14. SUBSEQUENT\nE\nV\nE\nN\nT\nS\nOn 06 May 2025, the Group announced the appointment of Mr P R Elliott to the Board with immediate effect.\nOn 28 May 2025, the Group announced that a property at its Speldhurst site has been sold for \u00a3715,000. This generated net proceeds of \u00a394,500 following the repayment of associated third party loans and professional fees.\nOn 1 July 2025, the Group announced that it has acquired, from Trafalgar Director, P R Elliott (the \"Vendor\"), a 10% equity interest in Hilton House, a commercial property located in central Stockport, Manchester, for a purchase price of \u00a3350,000. This acquisition constitutes a substantial transaction under AIM Rule 12. The consideration for the 10% interest in Hilton House is to be satisfied through a combination of equity issuance (the \"Equity Issuance\") and a convertible loan note (the \"Convertible Loan Note\" or \"CLN\"), comprising:\n\u00b7\nAn initial Equity Issuance of 366,666,667 new ordinary shares in Trafalgar at \u00a30.0003 per share, amounting to \u00a3110,000 (\"Consideration Shares\"). This will result in the Vendor holding 29.43% of the fully diluted issued share capital of Trafalgar.\n\u00b7\nThe balance of \u00a3240,000 will be satisfied through the issue of an unsecured CLN, convertible at the same \u00a30.0003 strike price. Conversion of the CLN will be subject to shareholder approval, in the event any proposed conversion results in the Vendor increasing its shareholding in Trafalgar above 29.9%.\nHilton House, independently valued at \u00a33.5 million, is currently a vacant office building which comprises a 1970's-built office complex consisting of four interlinked blocks, including three 3-storey buildings and one 8-storey building, encircled by 68 parking spaces. The property has the potential for redevelopment into a residential buy-to-let scheme, subject to future planning consents. The transaction provides the Company exposure to potential uplift from the repositioning of the asset into a residential or mixed-used scheme, subject to future planning consents. The 10% equity interest will give Trafalgar rights to 10% of any future potential rental income derived from Hilton House and 10% of the sale proceeds on any future disposal of the site.\nOn 16 July 2025, the Group announced that Wager Holdings Limited (\"Wager\") has invested \u00a350,000 by way of direct subscription (the \"Subscription\") of 500,000,000 new ordinary shares of \u00a30.0001 each in the capital of the Company (the \"Subscription Shares\"), at a price of \u00a30.0001 per share (the \"Issue Price\"). The Subscription will be used primarily to fund working capital requirements.\nIn addition to the Subscription, Trafalgar created 150,000 \u00a31 unsecured interest free convertible loan notes (\"CLNs\") and entered into a formal agreement to issue those 150,000 CLNs for a subscription value of \u00a3150,000 (the \"Wager CLN\") from Wager. It is intended that the Wager CLN will also be used primarily to fund working capital requirements.\nThe key terms of the Wager CLN are:\n- up to \u00a3150,000 total facility (principal) amount.\n- repayable on or before 31 December 2025.\n- interest free and unsecured.\n- convertible at \u00a30.0001, being a discount of 71.43% to the closing mid-market share price on 14 July, being \u00a30.00035\n- transferrable and will not be quoted.\nThe conversion of the CLN would be restricted to ensure that, immediately following such conversion, the new fully paid shares issued to the CLN holder, together with any shares already held by the CLN holder and persons acting in concert (as defined in the Takeover Code), do not carry in aggregate 29.9% or more of the voting rights of the Company. Exceptions to this restriction include conversion as part of a sale of the entire issued share capital of the Company, conversion with Takeover Panel approval or conversion as part of a mandatory offer for the remaining shares in the Company, under Rule 9 of the Takeover Code.\nAt the date of these financial statements \u00a3100,000 had been drawn down.\n15.\nCONTROLLING PARTY\nThe company has no controlling party.\nExplanation of resolutions at the Annual General Meeting\nInformation relating to resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting is set out below.
