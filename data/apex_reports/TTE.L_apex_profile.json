Exploration & Production results are expected to reflect the decrease in the average liquids and gas sales prices quarter to quarter, in line with published sensitivities. Year\u2011on\u2011year, Exploration & Production cash flow benefits from accretive production growth, limiting the impact of the decrease to around $6/b out of the $11/b drop. Integrated LNG is expected to deliver a result and cash flow in line with the third quarter of 2025, supported by higher LNG production (end of turnaround at Ichthys LNG) and sales offsetting a 5% decrease in the average LNG price. Integrated Power cash flow is expected to increase, supported by the farm\u2011downs completed in the fourth quarter, enabling the segment to reach more than $2.5 billion in annual cash flow, in line with the full\u2011year guidance. Refining & Chemicals results and cash flow are expected to increase strongly with the good operational performance of the units enabling the capture of the increase of more than 30% of the margins. Marketing & Services results and cash flow are expected to be broadly in line with the previous quarter. Net investments for 2025 are expected to be close to $17 billion, benefiting from more than $2 billion in divestments in the fourth quarter. A release of more than $3 billion in working capital is anticipated over the quarter, leading to a gearing ratio which should be around 15% at year-end 2025.\n2025 Sensitivities*\nChange\nEstimated impact on adjusted net operating income\nEstimated impact on cash flow from operations\nDollar\n+/- 0.1 $ per \u20ac\n-/+ 0.1 B$\n~0 B$\nAverage liquids price **\n+/- 10 $/b\n+/- 2.3 B$\n+/- 2.8 B$\nEuropean gas price \u2013 TTF\n+/- 2 $/Mbtu\n+/- 0.4 B$\n+/- 0.4 B$\nEuropean Refining Margin Marker (ERM)\n+/- 1 $/b\n+/- 0.3 B$\n+/- 0.4 B$\n* Sensitivities are revised once per year upon publication of the previous year\u2019s fourth quarter results. Sensitivities are estimates based on assumptions about TotalEnergies\u2019 portfolio in 2025. Actual results could vary significantly from estimates based on the application of these sensitivities. The impact of the $-\u20ac sensitivity on adjusted net operating income is essentially attributable to Refining & Chemicals.\n** In a 70-80 $/b Brent environment.\nUnit change for the \u201cEuropean Refining Margin Indicator\u201d (ERM)\nFrom 4Q25 results, the \u201cEuropean Refining Margin Indicator\u201d (ERM) will be reported in $/b to better reflect the integration of refining in the energy value chain.

They may prove to be inaccurate in the future, and may evolve or be modified with a significant difference between the actual results and those initially estimated, due to the uncertainties notably related to the economic, financial, competitive and regulatory environment, or due to the occurrence of risk factors, such as, notably, the price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas, the evolution of the demand and price of petroleum products, the changes in production results and reserves estimates, the ability to achieve cost reductions and operating efficiencies without unduly disrupting business operations, changes in laws and regulations including those related to the environment and climate, currency fluctuations, technological innovations, meteorological conditions and events, as well as socio-demographic, economic and political developments, changes in market conditions, loss of market share and changes in consumer preferences, or pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

An ambition expresses an outcome desired by TotalEnergies, it being specified that the means to be deployed do not depend solely on TotalEnergies. These forward-looking statements may generally be identified by the use of the future or conditional tense or forward-looking words such as \u201cwill\u201d, \u201cshould\u201d, \u201ccould\u201d, \u201cwould\u201d, \u201cmay\u201d, \u201clikely\u201d, \u201cmight\u201d, \u201cenvisions\u201d, \u201cintends\u201d, \u201canticipates\u201d, \u201cbelieves\u201d, \u201cconsiders\u201d, \u201cplans\u201d, \u201cexpects\u201d, \u201cthinks\u201d, \u201ctargets\u201d, \u201caims\u201d or similar terminology.

They may prove to be inaccurate in the future, and may evolve or be modified with a significant difference between the actual results and those initially estimated, due to the uncertainties notably related to the economic, financial, competitive and regulatory environment, or due to the occurrence of risk factors, such as, notably, the price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas, the evolution of the demand and price of petroleum products, the changes in production results and reserves estimates, the ability to achieve cost reductions and operating efficiencies without unduly disrupting business operations, changes in laws and regulations including those related to the environment and climate, currency fluctuations, technological innovations, meteorological conditions and events, as well as socio-demographic, economic and political developments, changes in market conditions, loss of market share and changes in consumer preferences, or pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic.
