This acquisition of low-cost and long-plateau assets, well connected to Henry Hub through existing midstream infrastructure, further strengthens TotalEnergies\u2019 integration across the liquefied natural gas (LNG) value chain in the US.\nTotalEnergies further expands its natural gas production in the U.S.\nThese assets have the potential to reach a gross production of around 350 MMscfd by 2030 and to sustain this production level over the long term. They will enable TotalEnergies to secure a net gas production of around 150 MMscfd.\nThis acquisition of non-operated shale gas assets complements the Dorado and Constellation acquisitions completed in 2024 in the Eagle Ford Basin.\nIn addition, TotalEnergies operates a technical production of around 500 MMscfd in the Barnett.\n\u201cThis acquisition will further increase our natural gas production in the United States and consolidate TotalEnergies\u2019 integrated LNG position with a competitive low-cost and low-emission gas production\u201d, said\nNicolas Terraz, President, Exploration & Production at TotalEnergies\n. \u201cWe are delighted to partner with Continental Resources, a reference operator in the Anadarko Basin, recognized for its strong technical expertise and operational excellence.\u201d\nTotalEnergies, the world\u2019s third largest LNG player\nTotalEnergies is the world\u2019s third largest LNG player with a global portfolio of 40 Mt/y in 2024 thanks to its interests in liquefaction plants in all geographies. The Company benefits from an integrated position across the LNG value chain, including production, transportation, access to more than 20 Mt/y of regasification capacity in Europe, trading, and LNG bunkering. TotalEnergies\u2019 ambition is to increase the share of natural gas in its sales mix to close to 50% by 2030, to reduce carbon emissions and eliminate methane emissions associated with the gas value chain, and to work with local partners to promote the transition from coal to natural gas.\nAbout TotalEnergies\nTotalEnergies is a global integrated energy company that produces and markets energies: oil and biofuels, natural gas, biogas and low-carbon hydrogen, renewables and electricity. Our more than 100,000 employees are committed to providing as many people as possible with energy that is more reliable, more affordable and more sustainable.

          "content": "29 Sep 2025 13:51\nPatrick Pouyann\u00e9, Chairman and CEO of TotalEnergies, and the members of the Executive Committee present the Company's Strategy and Outlook today in New York. A live broadcast of the event in English is available at totalenergies.com.\nTotalEnergies implements with consistency its balanced and profitable transition strategy, anchored on two pillars: Oil & Gas, mainly LNG, and Integrated Power. The Company plans to increase energy production (oil, gas and electricity) by ~\n4% per year through 2030\nwhile reducing emissions from its operations (-50% on Oil & Gas Scope 1+21 in 2030 compared to 2015, and -80% on methane emissions in 2030 compared to 2020).\nWhile confirming its growth objectives, TotalEnergies announces a\n$7.5 billion savings program\n(Capex + Opex)\nover 2026-2030. The Company reduces its\nnet Capex guidance to ~$16 billion in 2026 and $15-17 billion per year during 2027-2030\n, down $1 billion per year compared to previous guidance. The Company will remain focused on high margin Upstream projects and stay selective on low-carbon Capex, which will represent ~$4 billion per year, including $3 to 4 billion per year for the Integrated Power business.\nTotalEnergies plans for +3% per year oil and gas growth\nbetween 2024 and 2030 thanks to the start-up of accretive projects from its rich portfolio, 95% of 2030 production being either already running or under development. In 2025 and 2026, this growth will exceed 3% per year, benefiting from the start-up of several high-margin oil projects (Offshore US, Brazil, Iraq, Uganda) and major LNG and gas projects (NFE in Qatar, Jerun in Malaysia).\nIntegrated LNG is expected to deliver cash flow growth of more than 70% by 20302 compared to 2024 at $70/b and $8/Mbtu. This is driven by 50% sales growth that is mainly coming from LNG projects in the United States and Qatar (Rio Grande LNG Train 1-4 in the United-States, NFE and NFS in Qatar), which are among the most competitive in the world. In addition, the Company will develop gas-to-power integration, mainly in the United States and Europe, in order to complete its Integrated Power business model.\nTotalEnergies plans to increase electricity production by approximately 20% per year through 2030, resulting in 100 to 120 TWh/y of electricity production, of which 70% is renewable and 30% flexible gas. TotalEnergies intends to focus its investments on the main deregulated markets (United States, Europe, Brazil) in which the Company deploys its integrated model. The Integrated Power segment will be free cash-flow positive by 2028 and achieve a ROACE of 12% by 2030. TotalEnergies\u2019 profitable diversification through the electricity value chain is positively differentiating versus peers and creates value for shareholders by contributing to dividend growth regardless of Oil & Gas cycles and thus, enhancing the Company\u2019s resilience.\nThanks to the Company\u2019s disciplined investment policy as well as\nanticipated free cash flow growth of around $10 billion by 2030\n(compared to 2024 in the same price environment), the Board of Directors reaffirmed\nthe priority given to dividend and its growth through cycles\nand confirmed a\nshareholder return3 policy of more than 40% of annual cash flow regardless of energy prices.\nOn September 24, the Board of Directors also authorized $1.5 billion of share buybacks4 in the fourth quarter 2025, resulting in $7.5 billion of share buybacks for the full year 2025. In addition, the Board of Directors approved 2026 share buyback guidance of between $0.75 billion and $1.5 billion per quarter for a Brent price between $60 and $70/b and an exchange rate of around 1.20 $/\u20ac. This should lead to a payout of around 50% at $70/b in 2026.\nAbout TotalEnergies\nTotalEnergies is a global integrated energy company that produces and markets energies: oil and biofuels, natural gas, biogas and low-carbon hydrogen, renewables and electricity.
