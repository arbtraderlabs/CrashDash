On the occasion, Patrick Pouyann\u00e9 said:\n\u201cWith cash flow stable at $7.2 billion, TotalEnergies once again demonstrates its ability to offset lower hydrocarbon prices thanks to accretive growth in its Upstream production of 3.9% in 2025, exceeding the guidance of above 3%.\nFor the year 2025, the Company reported adjusted net income of $15.6 billion and cash flow of $27.8 billion in an environment marked by a decline of 15% in oil prices. IFRS net income amounted to $13.1 billion, down 17%. Return on average capital employed stood at 12.6%, the best among the majors for the fourth consecutive year. TotalEnergies continued to implement its balanced, disciplined growth strategy by investing $17.1 billion in 2025, including 37% for new Oil & Gas projects and around $3.5 billion in low-carbon energies, of which nearly $3 billion in electricity. TotalEnergies ended 2025 with a gearing ratio at 15%, highlighting the Company\u2019s solid financial position.\nFourth-quarter Oil & Gas production reached 2.545 Mboe/d, up nearly 5% year-on-year. Exploration & Production delivered adjusted net operating income of $1.8 billion and cash flow of $3.6 billion in the quarter. For the year 2025, Exploration & Production generated adjusted net operating income of $8.4 billion and cash flow of $15.6 billion. In 2025, TotalEnergies\u2019 production growth benefited from the start-up and ramp-up of seven major projects (Mero-2, Mero-3 and Mero-4 in Brazil, Anchor and Ballymore in the United States, Fenix in Argentina and Tyra in Denmark). Accretive upstream production growth helped offset $5/b of the $11/b price decline recorded over the year. The Company maintained operating costs at $5/b in 2025 and continued to reduce operated methane emissions by over 20% during the year.\nWith a reserve replacement rate of 116% in 2025, TotalEnergies maintains proven reserves life above 12 years, while continuing to build its future project portfolio. The Company signed an agreement with Galp to acquire a 40% operated interest in the prolific PEL83 license, which includes the Mopane discovery. It also expanded its exploration portfolio by entering new licenses in Algeria, the United States, Nigeria, Malaysia, Indonesia, Guyana and Liberia. TotalEnergies pursued active management of its upstream portfolio, notably signing an agreement to merge its mature UK North Sea assets with NEO NEXT and selling interests in non-operated projects in Nigeria and Brazil.\nAdjusted net operating income and cash flow for the Integrated LNG segment are stable compared to the third quarter of 2025, reaching $0.9 billion and $1.2 billion respectively. These results were supported by higher production (restart of Ichthys LNG) and LNG sales, offsetting a 5% decline in average LNG sales prices during the quarter. For full-year 2025, Integrated LNG generated adjusted net operating income of $4.1 billion and cash flow of $4.7 billion. The Company continued to strengthen its integration along the US LNG value chain with the investment decision for Train 4 of the Rio Grande LNG project, including the purchase of 1.5 Mt/year of LNG and the acquisition of new upstream gas interests in the Anadarko Basin.\nIn the fourth quarter, Integrated Power confirmed the strong performance of previous quarters with adjusted net operating income of $564 million and much higher cash flow of $788 million. For 2025, cash flow amounted to $2.6 billion, in line with the announced target. Return on average capital employed stood at 10%. Net electricity production reached 48 TWh, up 17% year-on-year, helping reduce the average carbon intensity of all energy products sold to customers (-18.5% versus 2015). To accelerate its gas-to-power integration strategy in Europe, TotalEnergies signed an agreement with EPH to acquire 50% of a portfolio of flexible power generation assets with more than 14 GW of gross capacity. In 2025, TotalEnergies also recycled $2 billion of capital by selling 50% of a 2.7 GW gross capacity portfolio (United States, Portugal, Greece, France), in line with its renewables business model.\nDownstream delivered adjusted net operating income of $1.3 billion, up 26% in the quarter, and cash flow of $2.0 billion, up 19%, driven by more than a 30% increase in European refining margins. For 2025, Downstream adjusted net operating income reached $3.8 billion and cash flow $6.2 billion, with Refining & Chemicals capt"

Exploration & Production results are expected to reflect the decrease in the average liquids and gas sales prices quarter to quarter, in line with published sensitivities. Year\u2011on\u2011year, Exploration & Production cash flow benefits from accretive production growth, limiting the impact of the decrease to around $6/b out of the $11/b drop. Integrated LNG is expected to deliver a result and cash flow in line with the third quarter of 2025, supported by higher LNG production (end of turnaround at Ichthys LNG) and sales offsetting a 5% decrease in the average LNG price. Integrated Power cash flow is expected to increase, supported by the farm\u2011downs completed in the fourth quarter, enabling the segment to reach more than $2.5 billion in annual cash flow, in line with the full\u2011year guidance. Refining & Chemicals results and cash flow are expected to increase strongly with the good operational performance of the units enabling the capture of the increase of more than 30% of the margins. Marketing & Services results and cash flow are expected to be broadly in line with the previous quarter. Net investments for 2025 are expected to be close to $17 billion, benefiting from more than $2 billion in divestments in the fourth quarter. A release of more than $3 billion in working capital is anticipated over the quarter, leading to a gearing ratio which should be around 15% at year-end 2025.\n2025 Sensitivities*\nChange\nEstimated impact on adjusted net operating income\nEstimated impact on cash flow from operations\nDollar\n+/- 0.1 $ per \u20ac\n-/+ 0.1 B$\n~0 B$\nAverage liquids price **\n+/- 10 $/b\n+/- 2.3 B$\n+/- 2.8 B$\nEuropean gas price \u2013 TTF\n+/- 2 $/Mbtu\n+/- 0.4 B$\n+/- 0.4 B$\nEuropean Refining Margin Marker (ERM)\n+/- 1 $/b\n+/- 0.3 B$\n+/- 0.4 B$\n* Sensitivities are revised once per year upon publication of the previous year\u2019s fourth quarter results.

After the lifting of force majeure by Mozambique LNG, and the will of the consortium to resume the project, Mozambique LNG partners decided to proceed without the participation of UKEF and Atradius since these two Export Credit Agencies had not yet reconfirmed their commitment.The Mozambique LNG partners have unanimously agreed to provide additional equity to replace the UKEF and Atradius contributions, representing in aggregate approximately 10% of the external financing.TotalEnergies and its partners would like to thank the lenders representing around 90% of the external financing who have confirmed their commitment to the financing of the project, acknowledging its positive contribution to the development of Mozambique.\nFurthermore, TotalEnergies has taken note of the reports commissioned by the Ministry of Finance of the Netherlands from external advisors\nClingendael\nand\nPangea Risk\nregarding the human rights and security situation in Cabo Delgado, which were published on 1st December despite the fact that Atradius is no longer part of the financing.\nTotalEnergies regrets that both external advisors did not travel to Mozambique and conduct on-the-ground investigations by themselves, but produced a report relying mainly on information collected through third parties.\nRegarding the allegations of human rights abuses by members of the Mozambique Defense Forces, TotalEnergies reiterates\nthe clarifications\nmade by the Company on 20th November 2025 and invites its stakeholders to visit the dedicated webpage on its website\nhere\n.\n***\nAbout TotalEnergies\nTotalEnergies is a global integrated energy company that produces and markets energies: oil and biofuels, natural gas, biogas and low-carbon hydrogen, renewables and electricity.

          "full_content": "2 Dec 2025 09:50\nTotalEnergies (Paris:TTE) (LSE:TTE) (NYSE:TTE), TES, Osaka Gas, Toho Gas, and ITOCHU have signed a Joint Development and Operating Agreement, granting the Japanese companies a combined 33.3% stake in the Live Oak project \u2014 a large-scale facility to produce electric natural gas (e-NG) also known as e-methane, initiated by TotalEnergies and TES and currently under development in Nebraska, United States. Following the agreement, TotalEnergies and TES will each maintain a 33.35 % stake in the project.\nThe partners are now preparing the Front-End Engineering Design (FEED) phase, targeting a capacity of approximately 250 MW of electrolysis and 75 ktpa of methanation. The project, subject to a Final Investment Decision in 2027, is scheduled to begin commercial operations by 2030, with plans to export e-NG to Japan. Osaka Gas and Toho Gas will be the primary offtakers. This project helps the Japanese gas majors in achieving their goal of injecting 1% carbon neutral gas (such as e-NG) into the gas grid by 2030.\nThe agreement builds on the strategic partnership established between TotalEnergies and TES in\n2023\nto pioneer at scale production of e-NG. The Live Oak project will leverage Nebraska\u2019s abundant biogenic CO\u2082 resources, captured from bioethanol plants, and the growing renewable power generation capacity in the United States.\nThe participation of Osaka Gas, Toho Gas, and ITOCHU (as a coordinator of Japanese companies), underscores their commitment to decarbonization with the adoption of e-NG and positions Live Oak as the leading project for carbon-neutral gas production for Japan.\ne-NG is a synthetic gas produced from renewable hydrogen and CO\u2082. Chemically identical to conventional natural gas, e-NG can be seamlessly integrated into existing LNG infrastructure\u2014liquefaction, transport, regasification, and distribution\u2014without any alterations to consumer equipment.\n***\nAbout TotalEnergies\nTotalEnergies is a global integrated energy company that produces and markets energies: oil and biofuels, natural gas, biogas and low-carbon hydrogen, renewables and electricity. Our more than 100,000 employees are committed to provide as many people as possible with energy that is more reliable, more affordable and more sustainable. Active in about 120 countries, TotalEnergies places sustainability at the heart of its strategy, its projects and its operations.\nAbout TES\nTES is a global green energy company developing giga-scale projects to accelerate the energy transition. In Europe, TES\u2019 projects strengthen energy security and the diversification of energy imports, as well as support the European Union\u2019s decarbonisation efforts. In Wilhelmshaven, Germany, TES is developing a green energy terminal, that will serve as a major hub for sustainable molecules. The already operating floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU) will be followed by a large-scale onshore LNG terminal and a CO\u2082 export terminal. Globally, TES leverages renewable energy solar, wind, and hydro, along with climate-neutral CO\u2082 for the production of e-NG (electric natural gas). Large-scale e-NG projects are underway in the US (Live Oak), Canada (Project Mauricie), and across Europe, and the Middle East. These green molecules support the shift to real zero emissions across industries and help win the race against climate change.\nAbout Osaka Gas\nThe Daigas Group is dedicated to realizing a carbon-neutral future through its Carbon Neutral Vision and Energy Transition 2050 initiative. As part of this effort, the Group aims to integrate 1% e-methane into its gas grid by 2030, paving the way for broader adoption across society. To achieve this goal, the Group is actively advancing e-methane technologies, conducting demonstration projects, and building supply chains both in Japan and overseas\u2014driving progress toward carbon neutrality by 2050.\nAbout Toho Gas\nToho Gas aims to make its entire supply chain including its customers\u2019 sites carbon neutral by 2050.

          "full_content": "25 Nov 2025 14:31\nIn 2022, when Europe faced a major energy crisis due to a sharp decline in gas imports from Russia, France had to increase its imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to ensure its own energy security and contribute to that of Europe. To this end, and at the request of the authorities, TotalEnergies (Paris:TTE) (LSE:TTE) (NYSE:TTE) provided France, at its own expense and without any public subsidies, with a LNG floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU) in the port of Le Havre.\nThis terminal acted as a \u201csafety net,\u201d with its additional gas import capacity proving potentially very useful in the event of significant consumption peaks caused by winter weather conditions or geopolitical tensions. In doing so, TotalEnergies made a full contribution to the country\u2019s energy sovereignty in a highly tense and uncertain context.\nNow that gas supply conditions in France and Europe have stabilized, the Company notes that the floating LNG terminal in Le Havre is no longer necessary, as evidenced by its lack of use and as observed by the Rouen Administrative Court in its decision of October 16, 2025.\nIn this context, TotalEnergies has decided to demobilize its LNG FSRU in Le Havre.\nTotalEnergies, the world\u2019s third largest LNG player\nTotalEnergies is the world\u2019s third largest LNG player with a global portfolio of 40 Mt/y in 2024 thanks to its interests in liquefaction plants in all geographies. The Company benefits from an integrated position across the LNG value chain, including production, transportation, access to more than 20 Mt/y of regasification capacity in Europe, trading, and LNG bunkering. TotalEnergies\u2019 ambition is to increase the share of natural gas in its sales mix to close to 50% by 2030, to reduce carbon emissions and eliminate methane emissions associated with the gas value chain, and to work with local partners to promote the transition from coal to natural gas.\nAbout TotalEnergies\nTotalEnergies is a global integrated energy company that produces and markets energies: oil and biofuels, natural gas, biogas and low-carbon hydrogen, renewables and electricity.

(EPH) for the acquisition of 50% of its flexible power generation platform (gas-fired and biomass power plants, batteries) in Western Europe (Italy, United Kingdom and Ireland, Netherlands, France), valued at \u20ac10.6 billion (enterprise value), i.e. a multiple of 7.6x 2026 EBITDA.\nUnder the agreement, EPH will receive the equivalent of \u20ac5.1 billion in TotalEnergies shares. 95.4 million TotalEnergies shares will be issued, based on a price equal to the volume-weighted average share price of the twenty trading sessions preceding November 16th (signing date), i.e. \u20ac53.94 per share, representing about 4.1% of TotalEnergies\u2019 share capital and making EPH one of the Company\u2019s largest shareholders upon completion of the transaction.\nThe transaction will result in the creation of a joint venture owned 50/50 by TotalEnergies and EPH, which will be responsible for the industrial management of the assets and the business development, while each company will market its share of production under a tolling arrangement with the joint venture.\nA leading European platform\nThis transaction is fully consistent with TotalEnergies\u2019 Integrated Power strategy and will strengthen its position in European electricity markets by enhancing the complementary relationship between intermittent renewable power generation and flexible power generation (gas-fired plants, batteries). It will allow TotalEnergies to expand its power trading activities across Europe and develop its Clean Firm Power offering to its customers. This will position the Company as a key player to meet Europe\u2019s growing data center demand.\nFurthermore, leveraging TotalEnergies\u2019 strong position in supplying LNG to Europe, this transaction enhances the Company\u2019s ability to diversify value creation along the gas value chain, particularly between the United States and Europe. The additional net electricity production from the transaction, estimated at 15 TWh/y, will enable the Company to capture added value to approximately 2 Mtpa of LNG.\nThe transaction covers a portfolio of more than 14 GW gross capacity of flexible generation assets in operation or under construction. This primarily includes gas-fired power plants, biomass power plants and battery systems, which benefit from secured capacity revenues representing 40% of the gross margin, allowing TotalEnergies to strengthen its presence in the most profitable European electricity markets:\nItaly: 7.5 GW, with 3.7 GW in operation, 2.4 GW under construction, including two next-generation gas-fired power plants that are among the most efficient in Europe, and 1.4 GW under development. United Kingdom and Ireland: 7.1 GW, including 5 GW from operating gas and biomass plants, 0.4 GW of batteries under construction and 1.7 GW under development. Netherlands: 3.6 GW, with 2.6 GW from gas-fired plants that are particularly well located to meet the needs of the German market, 0.2 GW from batteries under construction and 0.8 GW under development. France: 1.1 GW, with 100 MW of batteries under construction and 1 GW under development.\nThe acquisition scope includes about 5 GW of projects under development. The agreement provides that the joint venture will become the preferred vehicle for TotalEnergies and EPH to drive flexible power generation growth in the targeted countries.\nAn acquisition immediately accretive to free cash flow per share for all TotalEnergies shareholders and accelerating implementation of the Integrated Power strategy and profitability\nThe transaction is immediately accretive to TotalEnergies\u2019 shareholders. Over the next five years, TotalEnergies expects an increase in available cash flow of about $750 million per year, which far exceeds the additional dividend requirement for the newly issued shares.\nAs a result of this transaction, the Integrated Power segment will generate positive free cash flow and contribute to shareholder returns as early as 2027 compared to 2028 previously. The transaction also contributes to the increase of Integrated Power\u2019s ROACE from 10% to 12% over the next five years.\nDue to this accelerated inorganic growth within the Integrated Power",

          "full_content": "14 Nov 2025 16:15\nThe Oil & Gas Decarbonization Charter (OGDC), a global coalition of leading energy companies championed by the CEOs of ADNOC, Aramco, and TotalEnergies and supported by the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI), today released its\n2025 Status Report: Implementing Action\n, highlighting accelerated progress and sustained momentum.\nTwo years after the launch at COP28, OGDC has become a unique action-oriented multilateral platform with the aim of accelerating progress toward decarbonization in oil and gas operations, a key sector in the global economy. The Charter now brings together 55 signatories operating across more than 100 countries, representing around 40% of global oil production. Two-thirds of signatories are state-owned companies, many from emerging economies.\nThis year, for the first time ever, the companies shared emissions data based on the\nOGCI Reporting Framework\n, laying the foundation for consistent reporting across 55 companies. Total operated Scope 1 and 2 emissions from OGDC signatories were estimated at around 1 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO\u2082e) in 2024, with an upstream carbon intensity of 24 kilograms of CO\u2082 equivalent per barrel of oil equivalent.\nThe 2025 Status Report shows:\nComprehensive coverage of leading companies:\n50 of 55 signatories submitted data for this year\u2019s report, covering 98% of OGDC operated production, most of which has received third-party assurance.\nIncreased transparency:\n35 companies provided previously unpublished performance data to the OGDC Secretariat. Three companies submitted data for the first time, two established company-wide baselines.\nAmbitions in action\nCovering 94% of OGDC production, 42 signatories have now set interim Scope 1 and 2 emissions reductions ambitions for 2030, and 36 have developed corresponding action plans. This reflects tangible progress since the Charter\u2019s 2024 Baseline Report, with six more companies shared interim ambitions and seven more developed corresponding action plans on methane and flaring.\nImpetus for action:\nExtensive Collaborate & Share program underway, with a focus on methane, flaring and reporting has helped inspire progress.\nCEO engagement:\n35 CEOs of companies who are signatories to OGDC reinforced their support of the Charter in a recent meeting earlier this month, ahead of COP30 and the launch of this shared report.\nOGDC CEO Champions commented:\nDr Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, Managing Director, Group CEO of ADNOC, COP28 President and OGDC CEO Champion\n, said: \u201cTwo years ago, at COP28 we came together to create the world\u2019s first truly industry-wide coalition to decarbonize at scale. Since its inception, OGDC has grown to include 55 signatories, representing around 40% of global oil production across more than 100 countries. Together, we are turning the Charter\u2019s words into action by delivering tangible progress, scaling innovation and reporting transparently against our shared commitments.\u201d\nAmin H. Nasser, President and CEO of Aramco and OGDC CEO Champion,\nreflected on the collective achievements to date: \u201cAfter just two years, OGDC is helping signatory companies to deliver measurable progress in emissions-reduction plans, reporting and transparency. OGDC\u2019s mentorship and training programs are helping companies around the world to progress their own voluntary emissions reductions ambitions and reports. This 2025 Report reaffirms our focus on continuing to make progress on emissions reduction plans, while maintaining the energy security the world needs.\u201d\nPatrick Pouyann\u00e9, Chairman and CEO of TotalEnergies and OGDC CEO Champion,\nadded: \u201cOGDC is about action and collective delivery. This year we moved from baseline to implementation, with almost all signatories reporting data that covers 98% of operated production and more companies setting 2030 targets backed by plans. This reflects that progress starts with what we measure and a shared reality that this is a journey where we advance faster together. Our focus now is clear. We must cut methane, end routine flaring and report progress consistently. We invite all IOCs and NOCs to join and show measurable results by the next COP.\u201d\nCapacity building remains central to OGDC\u2019s progress. Peer-to-peer exchanges, regional partnerships and technical workshops have strengthened capacities, while meaningful interactions with OGCI, the United Nations Environment Programme, the World Bank and many others, are helping scale practical solutions specific to the sector. At the company level, OGDC is helping to embed tailored, industry-specific training programs. More than 2,000 company professionals across 50 companies have now completed such programs through the Charter\u2019s Collaborate & Share initiative, representing a tenfold increase from the previous year.\nSignatories have invested approximately USD $32 billion US dollars in low-carbon solutions including renewables, carbon capture, hydrogen and low-carbon fuels in 2024.\nBj\u00f8rn Otto Sverdrup, Head of the",

          "full_content": "13 Nov 2025 10:50\nTotalEnergies (Paris:TTE) (LSE:TTE) (NYSE:TTE) has partnered with DelAgua to distribute improved cookstoves to hundreds of thousands of Rwandans. The initiative supports Rwanda\u2019s ambition to bring clean cooking to everyone by 2030 and reflects TotalEnergies\u2019 ambition to supply energy that is more affordable, more available, more sustainable and accessible to as many people as possible.\nThanks to funding from TotalEnergies, DelAgua will distribute 200,000 high-performance cookstoves within one year for the benefit\nof more than\n800,000 Rwandans\nliving in rural aeras. Their use reduces harmful smoke emissions by 81% compared to traditional open fires and reduces wood consumption by 71%. The project should also prevent the emission of more than\n2.5 million tons of CO2 equivalent\nover the next ten years.\nThe benefits of clean cooking\nAccording to the IEA, more than 2.3 billion people worldwide have no access to clean cooking solutions and still cook their meals on traditional stoves using wood, charcoal, kerosene, coal and even animal dung. Clean cooking will:\nimprove people\u2019s health\nthanks to better air quality, limiting the risk of respiratory complications and cardiovascular disease.\nreduce gender inequality\nby facilitating access to education, employment, entrepreneurship and, ultimately, financial independence for women. Clean cooking solutions represent a significant time-saver for people who would otherwise spend as much as twenty hours per week collecting wood for cooking purposes.\nreduce CO2 emissions and deforestation\n. Universal access to clean cooking solutions would result in emission savings of up to 1.5 billion tons of CO2 equivalent by 2030 (900 million tons in Africa)\u2014equivalent to the CO2 emissions produced by the air and maritime industries in 2022 or the deforestation each year of an area the size of Ireland.\nCarbon credits recognized by the Paris Agreement\nThe carbon credits generated by the project will be acquired by TotalEnergies. They will be certified initially by the international organization VERRA, pending their approval under Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement Credit Mechanism as soon as the latter is operational.\nAfter prioritizing emission avoidance and reduction, the Company will use these credits from 2030 onwards to voluntarily offset part of its remaining direct Scope 1 & 2 emissions.\n\"TotalEnergies is proud to be part of this project in Rwanda, which will allow access to clean cooking to more than 800,000 people, illustrating the Company's purpose to provide more affordable, more available and more sustainable energy. By developing access to these cooking methods, TotalEnergies aims to have a positive impact on the environment and on people\u2019s health, while also helping to reduce gender inequalities. Clean cooking contributes to long-term social, economic and human development in a more sustainable way\u201d\n,\nsaid Arnaud Le Foll, Senior Vice-President New Business - Carbon Neutrality at TotalEnergies.\n\"This partnership demonstrates what can be achieved when innovation, integrity, and collaboration come together. By combining DelAgua\u2019s proven track record in delivering large-scale impact with TotalEnergies\u2019 commitment to sustainable development, we are transforming lives across Rwanda while setting a new benchmark for high-quality carbon projects globally\"\n,\nsaid Euan McDougall, CEO, DelAgua.\n***\nAbout TotalEnergies\nTotalEnergies is a global integrated energy company that produces and markets energies: oil and biofuels, natural gas, biogas and low-carbon hydrogen, renewables and electricity. Our more than 100,000 employees are committed to provide as many people as possible with energy that is more reliable, more affordable and more sustainable. Active in about 120 countries, TotalEnergies places sustainability at the heart of its strategy, its projects and its operations.\nAbout DelAgua\nDelAgua is a social enterprise with more than a decade of experience implementing large-scale carbon development projects that transform the lives of rural households in Least Developed Countries across Africa.

          "full_content": "4 Nov 2025 14:43\nTo bring its contribution to the public debate around the energy transition, TotalEnergies (Paris:TTE) (LSE:TTE) (NYSE:TTE) publishes the 7th edition of its \"TotalEnergies Energy Outlook\", which presents an overview of the energy system and scenarios for its evolution up to 2050. (\nDocuments available at this link\n).\nAccess to energy is essential to meet development needs\nToday, there are still around 4.6 billion people that lack access to a level of energy that is deemed necessary for satisfactory human development, particularly in terms of access to healthcare and education. Our collective challenge is therefore to meet this legitimate demand for energy for the populations of emerging countries, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\nMore energy, less emissions.\nThe stakes are clear: we must collectively reduce emissions from electricity generation, the leading global source of energy-related emissions with 14 billion tons of CO2 per year, and reduce the carbon intensity of transportation (the second-largest source of emissions) and heat generation for industrial and residential use.\nWhat has happened since the Paris Agreement in 2015?\nThe carbon intensity of the global energy system is decreasing\nEnergy demand has continued to grow, accompanying rising living standards in China and emerging countries. CO2 emissions have also increased, but the growth in CO\u2082 emissions has slowed since 2015, illustrating the deepening \u201cdecoupling\u201d between growth in energy demand and lower growth in emissions: the carbon intensity of the energy mix has improved. Even though the world is still in an \"energy addition\" phase, the transition is already underway in developed countries and is approaching in other countries, particularly China.\nThis transition is supported by the significant penetration of renewables in global electricity generation, which accounted for almost 80% of global electricity production growth between 2023 and 2024. It is also supported, in developed countries, by the gradual reduction in coal-fired electricity generation, which is being replaced by gas-fired electricity generation, particularly in the United States.\nThe differences in trajectories between the major regional blocks are becoming more pronounced, with common challenges around energy security and affordability.\nAgainst a backdrop of heightened geopolitical tensions and rivalries, different regions of the world are increasingly following different paths.\nThe United States has not only achieved energy independence thanks to shale oil and gas, but also became a net exporter of gas in 2017 and petroleum products in 2020. It has taken advantage of its abundant domestic gas production at competitive prices to reduce its CO2 emissions by gradually replacing coal-fired power plants with gas-fired power plants.\nChina continues to expand its dominance in low-carbon technologies through its integration across all of the value chains. It exports PV modules, batteries, and electric vehicles. This dynamic promotes innovation and lower costs. Although it continues to increase the installed capacity of coal-fired power plants, the use of more modern technologies and the massive penetration of renewable electricity sources are enabling it to gradually reduce the carbon intensity of its electricity mix and to envisage a peak in emissions in the coming years.\nThe European Union is leading the way in reducing emissions by continuing to decarbonize its electricity mix, but faces massive investment needs in its electricity grids and is confronted with the dual necessity of preserving the competitiveness of its industry and overcoming the reluctance of its population to accept the additional costs associated with decarbonizing energy use, with stagnant penetration of electric cars and heat pumps in particular.\nThree scenarios for 2050\nThe\nTrends\nscenario reflects the current trajectory of various countries up to 2030 and assumes that existing public policies, particularly in China and Europe, as well as technological developments, will continue in order to stay on course. It takes into account the recent acceleration in the penetration of mature low-carbon technologies: solar and wind power to generate low-carbon electricity, electric vehicles and heat pumps to use it, particularly in China. However, infrastructure constraints, particularly electricity grids, geopolitical tensions and cost barriers to these technologies limit their large-scale deployment. In this scenario, primary energy demand for coal in the global energy mix gradually declines, approaching by 2050 the level it had in 2000. Global demand for petroleum products increases and plateaus by 2040 before beginning a slow decline. Demand for gas continues to grow until 2040, before reaching a plateau. This scenario leads to an estimated temperature increase of between +2.6\u00b0 and +2.8\u00b0C by 2100.\nThe\nMomentum\nscenario is a more proactive forward-looking approach than current trends, ass",

On the occasion, Patrick Pouyann\u00e9 said:\n\u201cDespite a $10/b drop in oil prices year-on-year, TotalEnergies posted adjusted net income at the same level as the third quarter 2024 at $4.0 billion and $7.1 billion of cash flow during the quarter, which is up 4% year-on-year. The Company\u2019s strong financials are underpinned by accretive hydrocarbon production growth of more than 4% year-on-year and improved Downstream results that highlight the Company\u2019s profitable growth strategy and integrated model.\nExploration & Production reported adjusted net operating income of $2.2 billion and cash flow of $4.0 billion in the third quarter, increasing by 10% and 6% quarter-to-quarter, respectively. New projects have already generated around $400 million of additional cash flow year-on-year due to margins that are significantly above the portfolio average. The Company also continued to replenish its exploration portfolio, securing license awards in the Republic of Congo, Nigeria and Liberia.\nIntegrated LNG achieved cash flow of $1.1 billion this quarter, in line with the second quarter in a similar price environment (average LNG price around $9/Mbtu). TotalEnergies further progressed its integration strategy in the U.S. LNG value chain through the final investment decision of Rio Grande LNG Train 4 and the acquisition of new shale gas interests.\nIntegrated Power posted adjusted net operating income and cash flow of $0.6 billion this quarter, in line with the second quarter with electricity production during the first nine months up almost 20% year-on-year. The value of TotalEnergies\u2019 unique integrated model is illustrated by production assets (renewables and gas-fired power plants) and sales activities (B2B, B2C, trading) contributing equally to third quarter results. As part of its business model, TotalEnergies signed an agreement to divest 50% of two renewable asset portfolios in North America and France for ~$1.5 billion, demonstrating the ability to successfully valorize its portfolio.\nDownstream delivered adjusted net operating income of $1.1 billion and cash flow of $1.7 billion, increasing by almost $500 million year-on-year as good availability of assets allowed the Company to successfully capture improved refining margins in Europe.\nIn the third quarter 2025, net investments reached $3.1 billion, benefiting from around $400 million of disposals net of acquisitions. Gearing at the end of the third quarter now stands at 17.3%, improving by 0.6% compared to the end of the second quarter 2025, benefiting from a $1.3 billion positive contribution of working capital.\nUpon observing the Company\u2019s ability to deliver on its energy production growth objective, the Board of Directors has confirmed the distribution of the third interim dividend of 0.85 \u20ac/share for fiscal year 2025, an increase close to 7.6% compared to 2024 and at the same level as previous interim dividends. As announced on September 24th, the Board of Directors confirmed to authorize share buybacks for up to $1.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2025. The Board of Directors also approved the effective termination of its ADR (American Depositary Receipts) program, wherein the ADRs will be transformed into ordinary shares that will be listed on the NYSE from December 8, 2025.\u201d\n1.

Compared to second quarter 2025,\nExploration & Production results and cash flow should outpace the E&P production growth of 4% thanks to the accretive impact of the new barrels.\nIntegrated LNG cash flow should be in line with the second quarter 2025 in a similar environment (~$9/Mbtu), while the Integrated LNG results will be impacted by the planned turnaround at Ichthys LNG. Integrated Power results and cash flow are expected to be in line with the second quarter 2025 and within the annual guidance.\nDownstream results and cash flow are expected to improve by $400 to $600 million year-on-year\nreflecting the improvement of the refining margin in Europe\n(ERM growing to $63/t vs $15/t in the third quarter 2024) despite the turnarounds at Antwerp and Port Arthur.\nDespite a $10/b drop in oil price year-on-year, the results and cash flow from business segments should increase within a range of 0 to 5% thanks to the accretive hydrocarbon production growth and the improved results of the Downstream.\nNet investments are expected to be around $3 billion for the quarter benefiting from around $500 million in divestments net of acquisitions. A positive contribution from working capital of $1 to $2 billion is anticipated.\nThe gearing ratio should improve by 0.5 to 1% compared to the end of the second quarter 2025.\n2025 Sensitivities*\nChange\nEstimated impact on adjusted net operating income\nEstimated impact on cash flow from operations\nDollar\n+/- 0.1 $ per \u20ac\n-/+ 0.1 B$\n~0 B$\nAverage liquids price **\n+/- 10 $/b\n+/- 2.3 B$\n+/- 2.8 B$\nEuropean gas price \u2013 TTF\n+/- 2 $/Mbtu\n+/- 0.4 B$\n+/- 0.4 B$\nEuropean Refining Margin Marker (ERM)\n+/- 10 $/t\n+/- 0.4 B$\n+/- 0.5 B$\n* Sensitivities are revised once per year upon publication of the previous year\u2019s fourth quarter results.

Initial tests on sites have demonstrated the technology's ability to provide reliable and replicable measurements, detect leaks and identify the areas with the highest emissions, adding to Veolia's existing arsenal a powerful and rapid solution for reducing emissions.\nThis deployment will contribute to Veolia's strategy of maximizing\nthe capture of methane emissions in waste storage centers\n,\nwith a target of 80% capture by 2032\n, but also to use the innovative technology beyond the oil and gas industry.\nReducing the industrial sector\u2019s water footprint\nVeolia will support TotalEnergies in the implementation of its\nambition\nto\nreduce freshwater\nwithdrawals\nby 20% by 2030 compared to 2021\nat sites located in areas of water stress, and to improve discharge quality.\nJust a few weeks after the signing of a major agreement between Veolia and SATORP (co-owned by Saudi Aramco and TotalEnergies) in\nSaudi Arabia\n, the two companies will be working to\ndevelop wastewater reuse projects at TotalEnergies sites\n, reuse municipal wastewater for the Company's industrial processes, and deploy Veolia technologies to improve water treatment.\nMaking desalination more sustainable with low-carbon energy\nTotalEnergies will support Veolia in\naccelerating the deployment of low-carbon energy solutions at desalination plants\nbuilt or operated by Veolia. The partners have already jointly built the largest solar power plant for a seawater desalination facility in\nOman\n.\nThis project reflects Veolia's ambition to double its desalination capacity by 2030, while continuing to reduce the energy footprint of a technology which already uses ten times less energy than before.\nRecovering strategic resources from waste\nFinally, Veolia and TotalEnergies will also be pooling their research and innovation capabilities to explore the industrialization of new processes for recovering strategic chemical elements contained in waste that remain under-utilized, such as rare earths found in the permanent magnets used in wind turbines, photovoltaic panels and batteries.\n\u201cI am very pleased with the agreement signed today with TotalEnergies: by combining our expertise, whether in sustainable water management, the circular economy or the reduction of methane emissions, we are putting our innovation capabilities at the service of the ecological transformation and the competitiveness of our industries\u201d\n,\ncommented\nEstelle Brachlianoff\n,\nVeolia's Chief Executive Officer.\n\"We are delighted with this partnership with Veolia. TotalEnergies has cutting-edge solutions and technologies to offer Veolia and vice versa. Together, we can make a concrete contribution to the energy transition and the circular economy. We are convinced that cooperations like those we are developing with Veolia are very useful to make tangible progress and sustainably limit the environmental footprint of our companies\", said\nPatrick Pouyann\u00e9, Chairman and CEO of TotalEnergies\n.\nAbout TotalEnergies\nTotalEnergies is a global integrated energy company that produces and markets energies: oil and biofuels, natural gas, biogas and low-carbon hydrogen, renewables and electricity.

          "full_content": "29 Sep 2025 13:51\nPatrick Pouyann\u00e9, Chairman and CEO of TotalEnergies, and the members of the Executive Committee present the Company's Strategy and Outlook today in New York. A live broadcast of the event in English is available at totalenergies.com.\nTotalEnergies implements with consistency its balanced and profitable transition strategy, anchored on two pillars: Oil & Gas, mainly LNG, and Integrated Power. The Company plans to increase energy production (oil, gas and electricity) by ~\n4% per year through 2030\nwhile reducing emissions from its operations (-50% on Oil & Gas Scope 1+21 in 2030 compared to 2015, and -80% on methane emissions in 2030 compared to 2020).\nWhile confirming its growth objectives, TotalEnergies announces a\n$7.5 billion savings program\n(Capex + Opex)\nover 2026-2030. The Company reduces its\nnet Capex guidance to ~$16 billion in 2026 and $15-17 billion per year during 2027-2030\n, down $1 billion per year compared to previous guidance. The Company will remain focused on high margin Upstream projects and stay selective on low-carbon Capex, which will represent ~$4 billion per year, including $3 to 4 billion per year for the Integrated Power business.\nTotalEnergies plans for +3% per year oil and gas growth\nbetween 2024 and 2030 thanks to the start-up of accretive projects from its rich portfolio, 95% of 2030 production being either already running or under development. In 2025 and 2026, this growth will exceed 3% per year, benefiting from the start-up of several high-margin oil projects (Offshore US, Brazil, Iraq, Uganda) and major LNG and gas projects (NFE in Qatar, Jerun in Malaysia).\nIntegrated LNG is expected to deliver cash flow growth of more than 70% by 20302 compared to 2024 at $70/b and $8/Mbtu. This is driven by 50% sales growth that is mainly coming from LNG projects in the United States and Qatar (Rio Grande LNG Train 1-4 in the United-States, NFE and NFS in Qatar), which are among the most competitive in the world. In addition, the Company will develop gas-to-power integration, mainly in the United States and Europe, in order to complete its Integrated Power business model.\nTotalEnergies plans to increase electricity production by approximately 20% per year through 2030, resulting in 100 to 120 TWh/y of electricity production, of which 70% is renewable and 30% flexible gas. TotalEnergies intends to focus its investments on the main deregulated markets (United States, Europe, Brazil) in which the Company deploys its integrated model. The Integrated Power segment will be free cash-flow positive by 2028 and achieve a ROACE of 12% by 2030. TotalEnergies\u2019 profitable diversification through the electricity value chain is positively differentiating versus peers and creates value for shareholders by contributing to dividend growth regardless of Oil & Gas cycles and thus, enhancing the Company\u2019s resilience.\nThanks to the Company\u2019s disciplined investment policy as well as\nanticipated free cash flow growth of around $10 billion by 2030\n(compared to 2024 in the same price environment), the Board of Directors reaffirmed\nthe priority given to dividend and its growth through cycles\nand confirmed a\nshareholder return3 policy of more than 40% of annual cash flow regardless of energy prices.\nOn September 24, the Board of Directors also authorized $1.5 billion of share buybacks4 in the fourth quarter 2025, resulting in $7.5 billion of share buybacks for the full year 2025. In addition, the Board of Directors approved 2026 share buyback guidance of between $0.75 billion and $1.5 billion per quarter for a Brent price between $60 and $70/b and an exchange rate of around 1.20 $/\u20ac. This should lead to a payout of around 50% at $70/b in 2026.\nAbout TotalEnergies\nTotalEnergies is a global integrated energy company that produces and markets energies: oil and biofuels, natural gas, biogas and low-carbon hydrogen, renewables and electricity.

They will enable TotalEnergies to secure a net gas production of around 150 MMscfd.\nThis acquisition of non-operated shale gas assets complements the Dorado and Constellation acquisitions completed in 2024 in the Eagle Ford Basin.\nIn addition, TotalEnergies operates a technical production of around 500 MMscfd in the Barnett.\n\u201cThis acquisition will further increase our natural gas production in the United States and consolidate TotalEnergies\u2019 integrated LNG position with a competitive low-cost and low-emission gas production\u201d, said\nNicolas Terraz, President, Exploration & Production at TotalEnergies\n. \u201cWe are delighted to partner with Continental Resources, a reference operator in the Anadarko Basin, recognized for its strong technical expertise and operational excellence.\u201d\nTotalEnergies, the world\u2019s third largest LNG player\nTotalEnergies is the world\u2019s third largest LNG player with a global portfolio of 40 Mt/y in 2024 thanks to its interests in liquefaction plants in all geographies. The Company benefits from an integrated position across the LNG value chain, including production, transportation, access to more than 20 Mt/y of regasification capacity in Europe, trading, and LNG bunkering. TotalEnergies\u2019 ambition is to increase the share of natural gas in its sales mix to close to 50% by 2030, to reduce carbon emissions and eliminate methane emissions associated with the gas value chain, and to work with local partners to promote the transition from coal to natural gas.\nAbout TotalEnergies\nTotalEnergies is a global integrated energy company that produces and markets energies: oil and biofuels, natural gas, biogas and low-carbon hydrogen, renewables and electricity. Our more than 100,000 employees are committed to providing as many people as possible with energy that is more reliable, more affordable and more sustainable.

I have read that the withholding tax can be claimed back by non-French residents but am not sure how. Perhaps ask your fund manager? Why is the tax so high? Because France wants to retain its gold medal standing among developed economies for tax take. And, to listen to the NUPES wing of the National Assembly, 100% of dividends from CAC40 companies should be taken by the state to cover the current pension crisis that allows some workers (state ones of course) to retire before reaching 60. Now what a brilliantly stupid idea that would be.",

French shares attract a withholding tax of 30% except if held in a Frech investment package such as a PEA (like a UK share ISA). I have read that the withholding tax can be claimed back by non-French residents but am not sure how. Perhaps ask your fund manager? Why is the tax so high? Because France wants to retain its gold medal standing among developed economies for tax take. And, to listen to the NUPES wing of the National Assembly, 100% of dividends from CAC40 companies should be taken by the state to cover the current pension crisis that allows some workers (state ones of course) to retire before reaching 60. Now what a brilliantly stupid idea that would be.",

French shares attract a withholding tax of 30% except if held in a Frech investment package such as a PEA (like a UK share ISA). I have read that the withholding tax can be claimed back by non-French residents but am not sure how. Perhaps ask your fund manager? Why is the tax so high? Because France wants to retain its gold medal standing among developed economies for tax take. And, to listen to the NUPES wing of the National Assembly, 100% of dividends from CAC40 companies should be taken by the state to cover the current pension crisis that allows some workers (state ones of course) to retire before reaching 60. Now what a brilliantly stupid idea that would be.",

Because France wants to retain its gold medal standing among developed economies for tax take.

French shares attract a withholding tax of 30% except if held in a Frech investment package such as a PEA (like a UK share ISA). I have read that the withholding tax can be claimed back by non-French residents but am not sure how. Perhaps ask your fund manager? Why is the tax so high? Because France wants to retain its gold medal standing among developed economies for tax take. And, to listen to the NUPES wing of the National Assembly, 100% of dividends from CAC40 companies should be taken by the state to cover the current pension crisis that allows some workers (state ones of course) to retire before reaching 60. Now what a brilliantly stupid idea that would be.",

In particular, the Government confirmed all measures taken to address the security and the continued cooperation with Rwanda.\nConstruction activities have now restarted both offshore and onshore at Afungi site, with over 4,000 workers currently mobilized of which over 3,000 are Mozambican nationals. First LNG is expected in 2029 as the project progress is currently at 40% - almost all engineering and procurement of main equipments have been executed during the force majeure period.\nThe Mozambique LNG project will bring significant economic benefits to Mozambique during its development phase, notably through an ambitious local content plan. The project will provide up to 7,000 direct jobs for Mozambicans during construction, and contracts awarded to Mozambican compagnies are expected to amount to more than USD 4 billion.\nIn addition, Mozambique LNG has launched a large-scale socio-economic development program to support local communities in Cabo Delgado province. The Mozambique LNG Foundation, established in 2023 and endowed with a budget of USD 200 million, has already delivered tangible results, with over 8,000 jobs created and 7,000 farmers and fishermen supported by the Foundation in Cabo Delgado province.\n\u201cThe full restart of project activities marks a major milestone for Mozambique LNG and the country. I want to thank President Chapo and all Mozambican authorities for their commitment to the project. We are now working together to make this project a great success for the people of Mozambique\u201d, said\nPatrick Pouyann\u00e9, Chairman and CEO of TotalEnergies\n. \u201cThis landmark project will position Mozambique as a major LNG exporter.

It will have a direct and significant impact on job creation, both in construction phase and in the operational phase, stimulating the national labor market and promoting the capacity-building of Mozambican manpower. At the same time, it consolidates Mozambique\u2019s positioning as a regional energy hub and reaffirms the country as a credible and relevant actor in the global Liquefied Natural Gas market, strengthening its geostrategic position and its role in global energy security\u201d,\nsaid His Excellency Daniel Chapo, President of the Republic of Mozambique\n.\n***\nAbout Mozambique LNG\nMozambique LNG is a joint venture composed of TotalEnergies EP Mozambique Area 1 (26.5%, operator), Mitsui E&P Mozambique Area 1 (20%), ENH Rovuma \u00c1rea Um (15%), ONGC Videsh Rovuma (10%), Beas Rovuma Energy Mozambique (10%), BPRL Ventures Mozambique (10%) and PTTEP Mozambique Area 1 (8.5%).\nAbout TotalEnergies\nTotalEnergies is a global integrated energy company that produces and markets energies: oil and biofuels, natural gas, biogas and low-carbon hydrogen, renewables and electricity.

I have read that the withholding tax can be claimed back by non-French residents but am not sure how. Perhaps ask your fund manager? Why is the tax so high? Because France wants to retain its gold medal standing among developed economies for tax take. And, to listen to the NUPES wing of the National Assembly, 100% of dividends from CAC40 companies should be taken by the state to cover the current pension crisis that allows some workers (state ones of course) to retire before reaching 60. Now what a brilliantly stupid idea that would be.",

Because France wants to retain its gold medal standing among developed economies for tax take. And, to listen to the NUPES wing of the National Assembly, 100% of dividends from CAC40 companies should be taken by the state to cover the current pension crisis that allows some workers (state ones of course) to retire before reaching 60.

I have read that the withholding tax can be claimed back by non-French residents but am not sure how. Perhaps ask your fund manager? Why is the tax so high? Because France wants to retain its gold medal standing among developed economies for tax take. And, to listen to the NUPES wing of the National Assembly, 100% of dividends from CAC40 companies should be taken by the state to cover the current pension crisis that allows some workers (state ones of course) to retire before reaching 60. Now what a brilliantly stupid idea that would be.",

Because France wants to retain its gold medal standing among developed economies for tax take. And, to listen to the NUPES wing of the National Assembly, 100% of dividends from CAC40 companies should be taken by the state to cover the current pension crisis that allows some workers (state ones of course) to retire before reaching 60.

On the occasion, Patrick Pouyann\u00e9 said:\n\u201cWith cash flow stable at $7.2 billion, TotalEnergies once again demonstrates its ability to offset lower hydrocarbon prices thanks to accretive growth in its Upstream production of 3.9% in 2025, exceeding the guidance of above 3%.\nFor the year 2025, the Company reported adjusted net income of $15.6 billion and cash flow of $27.8 billion in an environment marked by a decline of 15% in oil prices. IFRS net income amounted to $13.1 billion, down 17%. Return on average capital employed stood at 12.6%, the best among the majors for the fourth consecutive year. TotalEnergies continued to implement its balanced, disciplined growth strategy by investing $17.1 billion in 2025, including 37% for new Oil & Gas projects and around $3.5 billion in low-carbon energies, of which nearly $3 billion in electricity. TotalEnergies ended 2025 with a gearing ratio at 15%, highlighting the Company\u2019s solid financial position.\nFourth-quarter Oil & Gas production reached 2.545 Mboe/d, up nearly 5% year-on-year. Exploration & Production delivered adjusted net operating income of $1.8 billion and cash flow of $3.6 billion in the quarter. For the year 2025, Exploration & Production generated adjusted net operating income of $8.4 billion and cash flow of $15.6 billion. In 2025, TotalEnergies\u2019 production growth benefited from the start-up and ramp-up of seven major projects (Mero-2, Mero-3 and Mero-4 in Brazil, Anchor and Ballymore in the United States, Fenix in Argentina and Tyra in Denmark). Accretive upstream production growth helped offset $5/b of the $11/b price decline recorded over the year. The Company maintained operating costs at $5/b in 2025 and continued to reduce operated methane emissions by over 20% during the year.\nWith a reserve replacement rate of 116% in 2025, TotalEnergies maintains proven reserves life above 12 years, while continuing to build its future project portfolio. The Company signed an agreement with Galp to acquire a 40% operated interest in the prolific PEL83 license, which includes the Mopane discovery. It also expanded its exploration portfolio by entering new licenses in Algeria, the United States, Nigeria, Malaysia, Indonesia, Guyana and Liberia. TotalEnergies pursued active management of its upstream portfolio, notably signing an agreement to merge its mature UK North Sea assets with NEO NEXT and selling interests in non-operated projects in Nigeria and Brazil.\nAdjusted net operating income and cash flow for the Integrated LNG segment are stable compared to the third quarter of 2025, reaching $0.9 billion and $1.2 billion respectively. These results were supported by higher production (restart of Ichthys LNG) and LNG sales, offsetting a 5% decline in average LNG sales prices during the quarter. For full-year 2025, Integrated LNG generated adjusted net operating income of $4.1 billion and cash flow of $4.7 billion. The Company continued to strengthen its integration along the US LNG value chain with the investment decision for Train 4 of the Rio Grande LNG project, including the purchase of 1.5 Mt/year of LNG and the acquisition of new upstream gas interests in the Anadarko Basin.\nIn the fourth quarter, Integrated Power confirmed the strong performance of previous quarters with adjusted net operating income of $564 million and much higher cash flow of $788 million. For 2025, cash flow amounted to $2.6 billion, in line with the announced target. Return on average capital employed stood at 10%. Net electricity production reached 48 TWh, up 17% year-on-year, helping reduce the average carbon intensity of all energy products sold to customers (-18.5% versus 2015). To accelerate its gas-to-power integration strategy in Europe, TotalEnergies signed an agreement with EPH to acquire 50% of a portfolio of flexible power generation assets with more than 14 GW of gross capacity. In 2025, TotalEnergies also recycled $2 billion of capital by selling 50% of a 2.7 GW gross capacity portfolio (United States, Portugal, Greece, France), in line with its renewables business model.\nDownstream delivered adjusted net operating income of $1.3 billion, up 26% in the quarter, and cash flow of $2.0 billion, up 19%, driven by more than a 30% increase in European refining margins. For 2025, Downstream adjusted net operating income reached $3.8 billion and cash flow $6.2 billion, with Refining & Chemicals capt",

I have read that the withholding tax can be claimed back by non-French residents but am not sure how. Perhaps ask your fund manager? Why is the tax so high? Because France wants to retain its gold medal standing among developed economies for tax take. And, to listen to the NUPES wing of the National Assembly, 100% of dividends from CAC40 companies should be taken by the state to cover the current pension crisis that allows some workers (state ones of course) to retire before reaching 60. Now what a brilliantly stupid idea that would be.",

I have read that the withholding tax can be claimed back by non-French residents but am not sure how. Perhaps ask your fund manager? Why is the tax so high? Because France wants to retain its gold medal standing among developed economies for tax take. And, to listen to the NUPES wing of the National Assembly, 100% of dividends from CAC40 companies should be taken by the state to cover the current pension crisis that allows some workers (state ones of course) to retire before reaching 60. Now what a brilliantly stupid idea that would be.",

Are there any tax implications to holding them in an ISA/SIPP, such as withholding taxes? Any help much appreciated as finding definite answers is proving harder than I expected!",

      "bear_case": "The only downside is a modest further decline if the company misses a key contract or faces regulatory hurdles.  Even then the stock would still be above the 70\u2011year low, so the risk is limited.",

      "if_bullish": "Enter 25% of the target position at the current low, then add another 25% if the daily close stays above the low and volume rises.  Place a tight stop 5% below the entry to protect against a false breakout.",
      "if_watching": "Hold cash until you see a daily close above the low with volume above the 5\u2011month average, or until a new renewable contract is announced.  Do not trade on rumors alone.",
