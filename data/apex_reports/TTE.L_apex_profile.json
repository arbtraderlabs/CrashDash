The project will provide up to 7,000 direct jobs for Mozambicans during construction, and contracts awarded to Mozambican compagnies are expected to amount to more than USD 4 billion.\nIn addition, Mozambique LNG has launched a large-scale socio-economic development program to support local communities in Cabo Delgado province.

          "content": "26 Jan 2026 07:39\nOn January 24th, during the Libya Energy & Economy Summit in Tripoli, Patrick Pouyann\u00e9, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of TotalEnergies signed an agreement extending the Waha Concessions up to December 31, 2050, in the presence of Abdul Hamid Dbeiba, Prime Minister of the Government of National Unity.\nThis agreement sets new fiscal terms allowing to increase the production of these concessions that are currently producing around 370,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d). Therefore, it paves the way for a new phase of investments, including the development of the North Gialo field, which is expected to add 100,000 boe/d of production.\n\u201cAs we celebrate 70 years of presence in Libya, we are pleased to sign this agreement, and I would like to thank the Libyan authorities for their continued support, in particular Dr. Khalifa Rajab Abdulsadek, Minister of Oil and Gas of Libya and Masoud Suleman, Chairman of the National Oil Corporation (NOC), Present in the country since 1956, TotalEnergies reaffirms its long-standing commitment to working alongside its partners to increase Waha\u2019s production, starting with the development of the North Gialo field. Extending the Waha concession, with its low cost and low emission giant resources offering many opportunities to grow production, fits perfectly with our strategy\u201d said\nPatrick Pouyann\u00e9, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of TotalEnergies.\nTotalEnergies in Libya\nTotalEnergies has been present in Libya since 1956. In 2025, the Company\u2019s production in the country averaged 113,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, from the offshore Al Jurf field (TotalEnergies 37.5%), the onshore El Sharara area (TotalEnergies 15% in former Block NC 115 and 12% in former Block NC 186), and the onshore Waha concessions (TotalEnergies 20.42%). The Waha concessions are held by NOC (59.16%), TotalEnergies (20.42%) and ConocoPhillips (20.42%) and are operated by Waha Oil Company (WOC), a company 100% owned by NOC.\nAbout TotalEnergies\nTotalEnergies is a global integrated energy company that produces and markets energies: oil and biofuels, natural gas, biogas and low-carbon hydrogen, renewables and electricity.

Exploration & Production results are expected to reflect the decrease in the average liquids and gas sales prices quarter to quarter, in line with published sensitivities. Year\u2011on\u2011year, Exploration & Production cash flow benefits from accretive production growth, limiting the impact of the decrease to around $6/b out of the $11/b drop. Integrated LNG is expected to deliver a result and cash flow in line with the third quarter of 2025, supported by higher LNG production (end of turnaround at Ichthys LNG) and sales offsetting a 5% decrease in the average LNG price. Integrated Power cash flow is expected to increase, supported by the farm\u2011downs completed in the fourth quarter, enabling the segment to reach more than $2.5 billion in annual cash flow, in line with the full\u2011year guidance. Refining & Chemicals results and cash flow are expected to increase strongly with the good operational performance of the units enabling the capture of the increase of more than 30% of the margins. Marketing & Services results and cash flow are expected to be broadly in line with the previous quarter. Net investments for 2025 are expected to be close to $17 billion, benefiting from more than $2 billion in divestments in the fourth quarter. A release of more than $3 billion in working capital is anticipated over the quarter, leading to a gearing ratio which should be around 15% at year-end 2025.\n2025 Sensitivities*\nChange\nEstimated impact on adjusted net operating income\nEstimated impact on cash flow from operations\nDollar\n+/- 0.1 $ per \u20ac\n-/+ 0.1 B$\n~0 B$\nAverage liquids price **\n+/- 10 $/b\n+/- 2.3 B$\n+/- 2.8 B$\nEuropean gas price \u2013 TTF\n+/- 2 $/Mbtu\n+/- 0.4 B$\n+/- 0.4 B$\nEuropean Refining Margin Marker (ERM)\n+/- 1 $/b\n+/- 0.3 B$\n+/- 0.4 B$\n* Sensitivities are revised once per year upon publication of the previous year\u2019s fourth quarter results. Sensitivities are estimates based on assumptions about TotalEnergies\u2019 portfolio in 2025. Actual results could vary significantly from estimates based on the application of these sensitivities. The impact of the $-\u20ac sensitivity on adjusted net operating income is essentially attributable to Refining & Chemicals.\n** In a 70-80 $/b Brent environment.\nUnit change for the \u201cEuropean Refining Margin Indicator\u201d (ERM)\nFrom 4Q25 results, the \u201cEuropean Refining Margin Indicator\u201d (ERM) will be reported in $/b to better reflect the integration of refining in the energy value chain.
