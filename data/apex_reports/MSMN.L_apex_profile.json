This review will mark Mosman's second independently verified helium resource, following Sproule's certification of Sagebrush earlier this year - a major milestone that reinforces the credibility and depth of our Colorado portfolio. Coyote Wash already represents over one billion cubic feet of best-estimate helium resources across six defined prospects. Independent verification will provide additional confidence in those figures and allow us to advance detailed planning for drilling and development. With two verified helium projects, one drilled and cased well ready for testing, and 3D seismic expected to commence this quarter, Mosman is now in a strong, strategic position - ahead of many peers in terms of resource definition and proximity to potential production.
