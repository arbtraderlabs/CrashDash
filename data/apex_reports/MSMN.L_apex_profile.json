The drilling rig is in the area and is ready to move onto location as soon as weather permits mobilisation.\nThe Vecta Project is located mainly in Las Animas County, close to the Red Rocks helium producing field and Blue Star Helium's Galactica development project. Helium concentrations of up to 11% have been encountered in offset wells and fields in the area, with the closest well, Texaco Cynthia True-1, flowing 8.8% helium from the upper Lyons sandstone.\nThis is the second of five wells planned in this drilling campaign testing five individual structural closures. The first well was drilled on the Billy Goat lease area to the east of The Bard. Mosman has a 20% working interest in The Bard lease area.\n\u200b\nLocation Map illustrating the five prospects identified by surface mapping within the Project Area.\n(Source: Vecta Oil and Gas Ltd.)\nAndy Carroll, Chief Executive Officer of Mosman, said:\n\"\nThe drilling at The Bard lease area of the Vecta project is an exciting opportunity to test a second helium target in an area of proven helium development and production. We believe each of these wells has an excellent chance of discovering helium.

We will now also commence work on a separate internal resource estimate for the Coyote Wash leases using the Sagebrush data. Given their proximity, these two Projects represent a compelling combination given the data, logistics and potential development synergies.\"\nSagebrush Project\nThe Sagebrush Project is in the Four Corners region in Colorado, US which is an area of established helium production from the Leadville formation carbonates from fields such as Doe Creek, 50 miles to the north of the Sagebrush Project.\nThe Sagebrush Project current oil production is circa 40 bopd (gross) from 7 wells which enable the 10,000 leased acres to be Held By Production. Mosman has existing well data, oil production records and seismic data and recently received test data from the Sagebrush-1 well drilled in 1993 from the previous operator where a drill stem flow test (\"DST\") conducted in the Leadville Formation flowed gas with 2.76% helium, 34.5% nitrogen, 39.9% carbon dioxide, 19.5% methane and circa 3% other petroleum gases.\nAt current market prices, the main value of the gas is the helium. The hydrocarbons may have value either for sale or avoiding costs by onsite power generation.\nThe data has been evaluated by an experienced team of consultants at FCH. The scope of its work includes a detailed petrophysical evaluation of Sagebrush-1 well logs and offset wells in addition to interpretation of the recently reprocessed 2D seismic swath data to determine the area of closure and reservoir parameters.\nSeismic Interpretation depth contour map of top of Leadville formation with Sagebrush-1 location (shown as a dot and circle). White dotted line shows area of closure (Source: FCH)\nContingent Resources\nResource Estimate\nMosman has utilised the FCH Report to estimate net C2 Best Estimate Contingent Resources. The resource assessment has been conducted in accordance with standard principles of Petroleum Resource Management (PRMS) which specifically applies to oil and gas reserves and has been deemed suitable for helium by the SPE.\nMosman notes the relevant reservoir zone has been drilled, logged and demonstrated to flow and the existing well is cased and cemented across the relevant zones, and that seismic data has been interpreted to determine the size of the structure. However, more work is required to demonstrate the optimal development, costs and markets, and is currently insufficient to assess commerciality. Work has already started to be able to determine commerciality and to be able to make a final investment decision (\"FID\") with the initial objective to put this well on production and thereafter determine the commerciality of additional development wells.\nRisk\nThe Sagebrush-1 well flowed and tested helium and hydrocarbon gas in volumetrically significant percentages and shut-in pressures indicated a reservoir that extended beyond the immediate area of the wellbores. The extrapolation of well data to the larger area of closure has some risk and, therefore, the\u00a0Geological Chance of Success\u00a0for the Contingent Resource (Pg) is deemed to be 0.75.\nGiven the favourable location, existing well, infrastructure and helium markets, the probability of commerciality is high, estimated to be 0.7 (Pcom).\nContingencies\nFive main contingencies identified for the Sagebrush Project development are:\n1)\nDrilling & Testing: There is a requirement for more flow testing to\na)\nestablish if the untested zones (such as the Lower Leadville) will flow, and the gas composition in those zones.\nb)\ndetermine reservoir pressure and flow rates over a longer time period, as the DST flow period was limited and mud damage appeared to be cleaning up with higher flow rate over time and pressure still rising when DST ended.\nOnce reliable production data is available, the viability of production from the existing well and the number of wells required to be drilled to economically produce the Sagebrush Project can be determined, including understanding of the method of helium and hydrocarbon gas separation. Then a field development plan can be prepared and the contingent resources may be converted to reserves.\n2)\nCorporate: There has been no final investment decision made by the Company to move forward the Sagebrush Project as a commercial development. The gathering of additional technical data, preparation of a detailed field development plan and associated detailed cost estimates are required to establish the commerciality of the project to make a final investment decision.\n3)\nLease: The current lease may be extended beyond the current 2030 end date for the Company to be able to make a final investment decision.\n4)\nMarket Access: There is a viable helium and hydrocarbon gas market in Colorado. Gas separation facilities, transport and sales contracts are required for the product to be sold.\n5)\nConfirmation of commerciality: Once a field development plan is designed and capital and operating costs are known, only then can economics be calculated to determine commerciality and a final reserve determination made.\nTable 1: Contingent Resources at Sagebrush lease area\nContingent Resources C2 Best Estimate (mmcf)\nHydrocarbons\nHelium\nSagebrush\n2,508\n305\nless\n18.67% royalty\n468\n57\nNet of Royalty\n2,040\n248\nMosman 82.5% (net)\n1,683\n205\nSource: Mosman estimates\nNotes\n1. The estimated quantities of gas that may potentially be recovered by the application of a future development project(s) relate to undeveloped accumulations. These estimates have a risk of development. Further appraisal and evaluation are required to determine the optimal development plan and commerciality.\n2.\u00a0The natural gas resource estimates have been derived in accordance with the principles of the Petroleum Resources Management System (PRMS). The PRMS specifically applies to petroleum. However, the Oil and Gas Reserves Committee of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) advised in August 2022 that although the gaseous extraction of natural hydrogen and helium is outside of the scope of the PRMS, the principles can be applied given the similarities in exploration, evaluation and exploitation.\n3.\u00a0The resource estimates are presented on a net entitlements basis and represent Mosman's net economic interest in the prospective recoverable hydrogen and helium volumes after deductions for an 18.67% royalty and the 82.5% working interest\n4.\u00a0The Contingent Resources have been evaluated using deterministic methods and represent C2 best estimates. A low case and high case were not estimated.\n5.\u00a0The estimates are for naturally occurring gas only. Adjustments for petroleum gases and inert gases have been made. No adjustment has been made to the estimates to account for fuel and flare\nFigure 1 Map of Sagebrush-1 well and Sagebrush and Coyote Wash leases (Source: Mosman)\nThe FCH Report notes the potential for a dual target Ismay oil and Leadville helium prospect, based on seismic interpretation. This is significant as it may enhance the economics of drilling and development of the Sagebrush Project.\nThe FCH Report notes that the Sagebrush-1 well reported fluorescence in the Lower Leadville, and this zone has not been included in the resource estimate as it was not flow tested.\nThe FCH Report also notes that the Sagebrush-1 well provides important data for assessing the Coyote Wash Project, especially as it confirms the presence of helium and the reservoir potential of the Leadville formation in this area.\nFuture Work Plan:\nIn addition to the plans to acquire 3D seismic, the current basis for near term planning is expected to include an extended flow testing of the Leadville formation at the Sagebrush-1 well. This may also include flow testing the Lower Leadville formation.\nWork has already started on a development plan that is anticipated to take several months to determine the commercial feasibility of development.\n\u200b\nQualified Person Statement\nThe information contained in this announcement has been reviewed and approved by Andy Carroll, a Director and Chief Executive Officer for Mosman, who has over 35 years of relevant experience in\nthe oil and gas industry and is a Member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers.\nThe current intention is that this resource estimate by Mosman will be followed up with an external independent consultant's report to assist in any potential future development decision.\nMarket Abuse Regulation (MAR) Disclosure\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014 ('MAR') which has been incorporated into UK law by the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.

However, where log and/or core data exist, this may suffice, provided there is a good analogy to a nearby and geologically comparable known accumulation.\nMcf\nThousand cubic feet\nBcf\nBillion cubic feet\nMcfpd\nThousand cubic feet per day\nMBtu\nOne thousand British Thermal Units\nMBtupd\nOne thousand British Thermal Units per day\nMMBtu\nOne million British Thermal Units\nMMBtupd\nOne million British Thermal Units per day\nMmcf\nOne million cubic feet\nNet, Net Production\nNet to Mosman's Working Interest; Net Production attributable to Mosman means net to Mosman's Working Interest before royalties\nSPE\nSociety of Petroleum Engineers\nSPE PRMS\nA standard for the definition, classification, and estimation of hydrocarbon resources developed by the Oil and Gas Reserves Committee of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and named the Petroleum Resource Management System\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

This review will mark Mosman's second independently verified helium resource, following Sproule's certification of Sagebrush earlier this year - a major milestone that reinforces the credibility and depth of our Colorado portfolio. Coyote Wash already represents over one billion cubic feet of best-estimate helium resources across six defined prospects. Independent verification will provide additional confidence in those figures and allow us to advance detailed planning for drilling and development. With two verified helium projects, one drilled and cased well ready for testing, and 3D seismic expected to commence this quarter, Mosman is now in a strong, strategic position - ahead of many peers in terms of resource definition and proximity to potential production. We're building a substantial helium business with clear momentum and tangible value catalysts ahead.\"\nEnquiries:\nMosman Oil & Gas Limited\nCarl Dumbrell\nChairman\nNOMAD and Joint Broker\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP\nStuart Gledhill / Richard Hail / Adam Cowl\n+44 (0) 20 3470 0470\nBrand Communications\nAlan Green\nTel: +44 (0) 7976 431608\nJoint Broker\nCMC Markets UK Plc\nDouglas Crippen\n+44 (0) 020 3003 8632\nUpdates on the Company's activities are regularly posted on its website:\nwww.mosmanoilandgas.com\nNotes to editors\nMosman (AIM: MSMN) is a helium, hydrogen and hydrocarbon exploration, development, and production company with projects in the US and Australia.
