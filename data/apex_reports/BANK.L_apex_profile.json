Upon the publication of this announcement via the Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n22 January 2026\nFiinu Plc\n(\"Fiinu\", the \"Company\" or the \"Group\")\nEverfex Earn-out Update\nFiinu Plc (AIM: BANK) announces an update in respect of the earn-out condition relating to the acquisition of its Polish operating subsidiary, Everfex P.S.A. (\"Everfex\"), the completion of an independent verification of Everfex's SME client order book, and the commencement of recruitment for a Country Manager in Poland.\nPursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement dated 7 August 2025, an independent review of Everfex's SME client order book has been completed by an external professional adviser, applying the same methodology used during the pre-acquisition due diligence process. The review confirmed an aggregate order book of approximately \u20ac340 million as at 31 December 2025.\nThe earn-out condition required an aggregate order book of not less than \u20ac750 million at 31 December 2025. As this threshold was not met, none of the 20 million additional consideration shares will be issued to Granicus Holdings O\u0170.\nThe Board considers the independent verification process to be a positive validation of Fiinu's governance framework, methodological consistency, and commitment to external assurance. The confirmed \u20ac340 million of contracted and credit-approved SME orders demonstrates meaningful commercial traction and evidences credible demand for Fiinu's currency hedging and foreign exchange solutions within the Polish SME market.\nSince acquisition, Everfex has continued to strengthen its operating controls, enhance client quality, and deepen commercial relationships under the Group's current management. To support the next phase of execution and accelerate conversion of pipeline opportunities, Fiinu has commenced the recruitment of an experienced Country Manager for Poland.

Upon the publication of this announcement via the Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n5 January 2026\nFiinu Plc\n(\"Fiinu\", the \"Company\" or the \"Group\")\nYear-End Update\nFirst Profitable Month Achieved & CEO Change in Poland\nFiinu Plc (AIM: BANK), the fintech group and creator of the Plugin Overdraft\u00ae, announces a year-end operational update in respect of the Group, including the achievement of its first profitable month and an update on governance and legal matters relating to the Group's Polish subsidiary.\nGroup Profitability Milestone\nFiinu achieved its first ever unaudited, Group-wide net profitable month in November 2025, including exceptional items. While the Board believes this represents encouraging progress towards sustainable profitability, the Group's financial performance may continue to vary from month to month.\nThis performance reflects operational and organisational changes implemented across the Group, including management restructuring of the Polish subsidiary, new business growth, and a renewed focus on cost discipline and operational execution.\nThe Board considers this milestone to be an important validation of Fiinu's strategy and operating model, and a foundation from which the Group can continue to build sustainable commercial progress in the new year.\nAt the year-end the unaudited Group cash balance was approximately \u00a35.34 million. The past few months' average monthly burn rate, without any unplanned exceptional items, is under \u00a3200,000 per month.\nManagement Changes, Governance and SPA Claims\nSince completion of the acquisition of Everfex P.S.A. (\"Everfex\"), Karol Oleksa and Marta Oleksa have been replaced by a significantly more senior and experienced executive leadership team, with Dr Marko Sjoblom appointed as Chief Executive Officer and\nAdam Narczewski as a senior executive officer of Everfex, acting under delegated authority from the CEO.\nThe Fiinu Plc Board considers these appointments to represent a material strengthening of the subsidiary's executive capability, governance standards, and operational oversight relative to the former management.\nThe Company has also served formal non-compete breach notices against Karol Oleksa and Marta Oleksa,\u00a0in respect of the non-compete obligations under Share Purchase Agreement (\"SPA\") relating to the acquisition of Everfex. The case is currently at the pre-trial stage.\nThese actions form part of a wider governance enhancement and regulatory compliance programme, under which the previous CEO and Vice-President\u00a0of the\nGroup's Polish subsidiary\nEverfex\u00a0have been replaced. The Board believes these measures are necessary to protect shareholder value, enforce contractual and regulatory obligations, and ensure the Group is appropriately positioned for its next phase of growth under strengthened leadership.\nDavid Hopton, Chair of Fiinu Plc, commented:\n\"\nFiinu completed the reverse takeover of Everfex with our re-admission to AIM in August 2025. The Board and Executive then were able to move quickly to review the systems and controls in place at Everfex in the final quarter of the year seeking to ensure consistency with our high Group governance standards and with local laws and regulations in Poland. As the Executive and Board undertook this work it became apparent that changes in the management structure were likely to accelerate the integration of Everfex into the Group culture and discipline. This resulted in the decisions outlined above.\n\"Following on from these decisions, regrettably, we have had to take action to address breaches of the non-compete clauses in the SPA mentioned above. However, this must not be permitted to undermine the fact that together with the acquisition of Everfex, and our careful management of the cost base, Fiinu has achieved a major milestone in 2025 in recording its first profitable month. We now look forward to 2026 as we continue to pursue the strategy we outlined in previous announcements and to the launch in Q1 of the Fiinu Plugin Overdraft\u00ae in association with our first partner Manx Financial Group.\n\"On behalf of everyone at Fiinu Group I would like to thank all our shareholders for their support throughout the past year, and look forward to working hard to achieve further steps on our journey in 2026.\"\nThe Directors of the Company are responsible for the release of this announcement.\n*ENDS*\nFor further information, please contact:\nFiinu Plc\nDr. Marko Sjoblom - CEO\nTel: +44 (0) 1932 629 532\nir@fiinu.com\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nomad)\nMark Brady / Angus Campbell\nTel: +44 (0) 203 368 3550/3551\nEmail:\nfiinu@sparkapl.com\nMarex Financial (Joint Broker)\nAngelo Sofocleous / Keith Swann / Matt Bailey\nTel: +44 (0) 207 655 6000\nEmail:\ncorporate@marex.com\nOberon Investment Limited (Joint Broker)\nNick Lovering / Adam Pollock / Mike Seabrook\nTel: +44 (0)203 179 5300\nBrazil (Financial PR)\nJoshua van Raalte / Christine Webb\nTel: +44 (0) 207 785 7383\nfiinu@agencybrazil.com\nFor more information, please visit\nwww.fiinuplc.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

These include, among other developments, Conister Bank having just received regulatory approval, the commencement of user acceptance testing within Fiinu's production environment for the Conister Bank Plugin Overdraft, powered by Fiinu.\nBoth parties continue to work through a defined set of remaining deliverables required ahead of launch. These include, among other matters, the progression of a payment solution. As a result, and following joint planning discussions,\nsubject to the completion of these items, the parties are now targeting a launch in Q1 2026. As with any regulated financial product, timing remains subject to third-party dependencies.\nBoth parties remain fully engaged and positive regarding the partnership and the forthcoming launch. The Company confirms that, while there are outstanding actions on both sides, there are currently no known insurmountable technical or operational issues that would prevent launch within the expected timeframe.\nAdditional White-Label Engagements and Platform Testing\nIn parallel with its work with Conister Bank, the Company continues to engage in discussions with a number of other European banks regarding potential white-label deployments of the Plugin Overdraft\u00ae platform. As part of these engagements, Fiinu has commenced early-stage platform testing activities with prospective partners in two EU jurisdictions. These activities are focused on validating technical integration, localisation requirements and regulatory alignment within differing European banking environments.\nWhile these discussions and testing programmes remain at an exploratory and non-binding stage, the Company believes they demonstrate growing interest from European banking institutions in Fiinu's technology and its potential applicability across multiple regulated markets. There can be no certainty that these discussions will result in formal commercial agreements, and any future progress remains subject to regulatory approvals and partner decision-making processes.\nDr Marko Sjoblom, CEO of Fiinu Plc, commented:\n\"We continue to make steady and constructive progress with Conister Bank on the development of the Plugin Overdraft\u00ae as a white-label solution, with a number of important milestones now achieved, including regulatory approval and commencement of user acceptance testing in our production environment. While there remain defined deliverables to complete ahead of launch, including third-party dependencies, both teams remain fully engaged and aligned on the path forward.\n\"In parallel, we are encouraged by the level of inbound interest from other European banks and by the early-stage platform testing currently underway in two EU jurisdictions. These activities are focused on validating the adaptability of our technology across different regulatory and operational environments. Although these engagements remain exploratory and non-binding, they underline the broader relevance of our platform and support our confidence in Fiinu's longer-term commercial strategy. As always, progress remains subject to regulatory processes and partner decision-making.\"\nThe Directors of the Company are responsible for the release of this announcement.\n*ENDS*\nFor further information, please contact:\nFiinu Plc\nDr. Marko Sjoblom - CEO\nTel: +44 (0) 1932 629 532\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nomad)\nMark Brady / Angus Campbell\nTel: +44 (0) 203 368 3550\nEmail:\nfiinu@sparkapl.com\nMarex Financial (Joint Broker)\nAngelo Sofocleous / Keith Swann / Matt Bailey\nTel: +44 (0) 207 655 6000\nEmail:\ncorporate@marex.com\nOberon Investment Limited (Joint Broker)\nNick Lovering / Adam Pollock / Mike Seabrook\nTel: +44 (0)203 179 5300\nBrazil (Financial PR)\nJoshua van Raalte / Jamie Lester /Christine Webb\nTel: +44 (0) 207 785 7383\nFor more information, please visit\nwww.fiinuplc.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
