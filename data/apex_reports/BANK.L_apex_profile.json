Upon the publication of this announcement via the Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n23 December 2025\nFiinu Plc\n(\"Fiinu\", the \"Company\" or the \"Group\")\nOperational Update\nWhite-Label update\nFiinu Plc (AIM: BANK), the fintech group and creator of the Plugin Overdraft\u00ae, announces an operational update in respect of continued progress on its Plugin Overdraft\u00ae white-label partnership with Conister Bank Limited (\"Conister Bank\"), a subsidiary of Manx Financial Group Plc (\"MFX\"), and additional white-label engagement and platform testing in Europe.\nConister Bank White-Label Partnership\nThe Company continues to make constructive progress on its white-label partnership with Conister Bank, with the project reaching a number of important milestones. These include, among other developments, Conister Bank having just received regulatory approval, the commencement of user acceptance testing within Fiinu's production environment for the Conister Bank Plugin Overdraft, powered by Fiinu.\nBoth parties continue to work through a defined set of remaining deliverables required ahead of launch. These include, among other matters, the progression of a payment solution. As a result, and following joint planning discussions,\nsubject to the completion of these items, the parties are now targeting a launch in Q1 2026. As with any regulated financial product, timing remains subject to third-party dependencies.\nBoth parties remain fully engaged and positive regarding the partnership and the forthcoming launch. The Company confirms that, while there are outstanding actions on both sides, there are currently no known insurmountable technical or operational issues that would prevent launch within the expected timeframe.\nAdditional White-Label Engagements and Platform Testing\nIn parallel with its work with Conister Bank, the Company continues to engage in discussions with a number of other European banks regarding potential white-label deployments of the Plugin Overdraft\u00ae platform. As part of these engagements, Fiinu has commenced early-stage platform testing activities with prospective partners in two EU jurisdictions. These activities are focused on validating technical integration, localisation requirements and regulatory alignment within differing European banking environments.\nWhile these discussions and testing programmes remain at an exploratory and non-binding stage, the Company believes they demonstrate growing interest from European banking institutions in Fiinu's technology and its potential applicability across multiple regulated markets. There can be no certainty that these discussions will result in formal commercial agreements, and any future progress remains subject to regulatory approvals and partner decision-making processes.\nDr Marko Sjoblom, CEO of Fiinu Plc, commented:\n\"We continue to make steady and constructive progress with Conister Bank on the development of the Plugin Overdraft\u00ae as a white-label solution, with a number of important milestones now achieved, including regulatory approval and commencement of user acceptance testing in our production environment. While there remain defined deliverables to complete ahead of launch, including third-party dependencies, both teams remain fully engaged and aligned on the path forward.\n\"In parallel, we are encouraged by the level of inbound interest from other European banks and by the early-stage platform testing currently underway in two EU jurisdictions. These activities are focused on validating the adaptability of our technology across different regulatory and operational environments. Although these engagements remain exploratory and non-binding, they underline the broader relevance of our platform and support our confidence in Fiinu's longer-term commercial strategy.

Upon the publication of this announcement via the Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n23 December 2025\nFiinu Plc\n(\"Fiinu\", the \"Company\" or the \"Group\")\nOperational Update\nWhite-Label update\nFiinu Plc (AIM: BANK), the fintech group and creator of the Plugin Overdraft\u00ae, announces an operational update in respect of continued progress on its Plugin Overdraft\u00ae white-label partnership with Conister Bank Limited (\"Conister Bank\"), a subsidiary of Manx Financial Group Plc (\"MFX\"), and additional white-label engagement and platform testing in Europe.\nConister Bank White-Label Partnership\nThe Company continues to make constructive progress on its white-label partnership with Conister Bank, with the project reaching a number of important milestones. These include, among other developments, Conister Bank having just received regulatory approval, the commencement of user acceptance testing within Fiinu's production environment for the Conister Bank Plugin Overdraft, powered by Fiinu.\nBoth parties continue to work through a defined set of remaining deliverables required ahead of launch. These include, among other matters, the progression of a payment solution. As a result, and following joint planning discussions,\nsubject to the completion of these items, the parties are now targeting a launch in Q1 2026. As with any regulated financial product, timing remains subject to third-party dependencies.\nBoth parties remain fully engaged and positive regarding the partnership and the forthcoming launch. The Company confirms that, while there are outstanding actions on both sides, there are currently no known insurmountable technical or operational issues that would prevent launch within the expected timeframe.\nAdditional White-Label Engagements and Platform Testing\nIn parallel with its work with Conister Bank, the Company continues to engage in discussions with a number of other European banks regarding potential white-label deployments of the Plugin Overdraft\u00ae platform. As part of these engagements, Fiinu has commenced early-stage platform testing activities with prospective partners in two EU jurisdictions. These activities are focused on validating technical integration, localisation requirements and regulatory alignment within differing European banking environments.\nWhile these discussions and testing programmes remain at an exploratory and non-binding stage, the Company believes they demonstrate growing interest from European banking institutions in Fiinu's technology and its potential applicability across multiple regulated markets. There can be no certainty that these discussions will result in formal commercial agreements, and any future progress remains subject to regulatory approvals and partner decision-making processes.\nDr Marko Sjoblom, CEO of Fiinu Plc, commented:\n\"We continue to make steady and constructive progress with Conister Bank on the development of the Plugin Overdraft\u00ae as a white-label solution, with a number of important milestones now achieved, including regulatory approval and commencement of user acceptance testing in our production environment. While there remain defined deliverables to complete ahead of launch, including third-party dependencies, both teams remain fully engaged and aligned on the path forward.\n\"In parallel, we are encouraged by the level of inbound interest from other European banks and by the early-stage platform testing currently underway in two EU jurisdictions. These activities are focused on validating the adaptability of our technology across different regulatory and operational environments. Although these engagements remain exploratory and non-binding, they underline the broader relevance of our platform and support our confidence in Fiinu's longer-term commercial strategy.

Manx confirmed in its market update last week that the project remains fully on plan and progressing as scheduled.\nThe joint development phase has now advanced to the final stages where the initial deployment and launch are scheduled to take place before the end of this year. This will mark the first live deployment of the Plugin Overdraft\u00ae product in the world, delivered under a white label arrangement with a licensed UK bank.
