Upon the publication of this announcement via the Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n22 January 2026\nFiinu Plc\n(\"Fiinu\", the \"Company\" or the \"Group\")\nEverfex Earn-out Update\nFiinu Plc (AIM: BANK) announces an update in respect of the earn-out condition relating to the acquisition of its Polish operating subsidiary, Everfex P.S.A. (\"Everfex\"), the completion of an independent verification of Everfex's SME client order book, and the commencement of recruitment for a Country Manager in Poland.\nPursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement dated 7 August 2025, an independent review of Everfex's SME client order book has been completed by an external professional adviser, applying the same methodology used during the pre-acquisition due diligence process. The review confirmed an aggregate order book of approximately \u20ac340 million as at 31 December 2025.\nThe earn-out condition required an aggregate order book of not less than \u20ac750 million at 31 December 2025. As this threshold was not met, none of the 20 million additional consideration shares will be issued to Granicus Holdings O\u0170.\nThe Board considers the independent verification process to be a positive validation of Fiinu's governance framework, methodological consistency, and commitment to external assurance. The confirmed \u20ac340 million of contracted and credit-approved SME orders demonstrates meaningful commercial traction and evidences credible demand for Fiinu's currency hedging and foreign exchange solutions within the Polish SME market.\nSince acquisition, Everfex has continued to strengthen its operating controls, enhance client quality, and deepen commercial relationships under the Group's current management. To support the next phase of execution and accelerate conversion of pipeline opportunities, Fiinu has commenced the recruitment of an experienced Country Manager for Poland. This appointment is expected to strengthen local leadership capability and support sustainable order book growth.\nDr Marko Sjoblom, Chief Executive Officer of Fiinu Plc, commented:\n\"The independently verified order book confirms a solid commercial foundation and growing demand among Polish SMEs. It reflects the disciplined, transparent approach Fiinu has applied since acquiring Everfex and provides a strong platform for future growth. With the recruitment of a Country Manager underway and continued execution focus across the Group, we believe Fiinu is well positioned to build long-term shareholder value.\"\nThe Directors of the Company are responsible for the release of this announcement.\n*ENDS*\nFor further information, please contact:\nFiinu Plc\nDr. Marko Sjoblom - CEO\nTel: +44 (0) 1932 629 532\nir@fiinu.com\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nomad)\nMark Brady / Angus Campbell\nTel: +44 (0) 203 368 3550/3551\nEmail:\nfiinu@sparkapl.com\nMarex Financial (Joint Broker)\nAngelo Sofocleous / Keith Swann / Matt Bailey\nTel: +44 (0) 207 655 6000\nEmail:\ncorporate@marex.com\nOberon Investment Limited (Joint Broker)\nNick Lovering / Adam Pollock / Mike Seabrook\nTel: +44 (0)203 179 5300\nBrazil (Financial PR)\nJoshua van Raalte / Christine Webb\nTel: +44 (0) 207 785 7383\nfiinu@agencybrazil.com\nFor more information, please visit\nwww.fiinuplc.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Upon the publication of this announcement via the Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n5 January 2026\nFiinu Plc\n(\"Fiinu\", the \"Company\" or the \"Group\")\nYear-End Update\nFirst Profitable Month Achieved & CEO Change in Poland\nFiinu Plc (AIM: BANK), the fintech group and creator of the Plugin Overdraft\u00ae, announces a year-end operational update in respect of the Group, including the achievement of its first profitable month and an update on governance and legal matters relating to the Group's Polish subsidiary.\nGroup Profitability Milestone\nFiinu achieved its first ever unaudited, Group-wide net profitable month in November 2025, including exceptional items. While the Board believes this represents encouraging progress towards sustainable profitability, the Group's financial performance may continue to vary from month to month.\nThis performance reflects operational and organisational changes implemented across the Group, including management restructuring of the Polish subsidiary, new business growth, and a renewed focus on cost discipline and operational execution.\nThe Board considers this milestone to be an important validation of Fiinu's strategy and operating model, and a foundation from which the Group can continue to build sustainable commercial progress in the new year.\nAt the year-end the unaudited Group cash balance was approximately \u00a35.34 million. The past few months' average monthly burn rate, without any unplanned exceptional items, is under \u00a3200,000 per month.\nManagement Changes, Governance and SPA Claims\nSince completion of the acquisition of Everfex P.S.A. (\"Everfex\"), Karol Oleksa and Marta Oleksa have been replaced by a significantly more senior and experienced executive leadership team, with Dr Marko Sjoblom appointed as Chief Executive Officer and\nAdam Narczewski as a senior executive officer of Everfex, acting under delegated authority from the CEO.\nThe Fiinu Plc Board considers these appointments to represent a material strengthening of the subsidiary's executive capability, governance standards, and operational oversight relative to the former management.\nThe Company has also served formal non-compete breach notices against Karol Oleksa and Marta Oleksa,\u00a0in respect of the non-compete obligations under Share Purchase Agreement (\"SPA\") relating to the acquisition of Everfex. The case is currently at the pre-trial stage.\nThese actions form part of a wider governance enhancement and regulatory compliance programme, under which the previous CEO and Vice-President\u00a0of the\nGroup's Polish subsidiary\nEverfex\u00a0have been replaced. The Board believes these measures are necessary to protect shareholder value, enforce contractual and regulatory obligations, and ensure the Group is appropriately positioned for its next phase of growth under strengthened leadership.\nDavid Hopton, Chair of Fiinu Plc, commented:\n\"\nFiinu completed the reverse takeover of Everfex with our re-admission to AIM in August 2025. The Board and Executive then were able to move quickly to review the systems and controls in place at Everfex in the final quarter of the year seeking to ensure consistency with our high Group governance standards and with local laws and regulations in Poland. As the Executive and Board undertook this work it became apparent that changes in the management structure were likely to accelerate the integration of Everfex into the Group culture and discipline. This resulted in the decisions outlined above.\n\"Following on from these decisions, regrettably, we have had to take action to address breaches of the non-compete clauses in the SPA mentioned above. However, this must not be permitted to undermine the fact that together with the acquisition of Everfex, and our careful management of the cost base, Fiinu has achieved a major milestone in 2025 in recording its first profitable month. We now look forward to 2026 as we continue to pursue the strategy we outlined in previous announcements and to the launch in Q1 of the Fiinu Plugin Overdraft\u00ae in association with our first partner Manx Financial Group.\n\"On behalf of everyone at Fiinu Group I would like to thank all our shareholders for their support throughout the past year, and look forward to working hard to achieve further steps on our journey in 2026.\"\nThe Directors of the Company are responsible for the release of this announcement.\n*ENDS*\nFor further information, please contact:\nFiinu Plc\nDr. Marko Sjoblom - CEO\nTel: +44 (0) 1932 629 532\nir@fiinu.com\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nomad)\nMark Brady / Angus Campbell\nTel: +44 (0) 203 368 3550/3551\nEmail:\nfiinu@sparkapl.com\nMarex Financial (Joint Broker)\nAngelo Sofocleous / Keith Swann / Matt Bailey\nTel: +44 (0) 207 655 6000\nEmail:\ncorporate@marex.com\nOberon Investment Limited (Joint Broker)\nNick Lovering / Adam Pollock / Mike Seabrook\nTel: +44 (0)203 179 5300\nBrazil (Financial PR)\nJoshua van Raalte / Christine Webb\nTel: +44 (0) 207 785 7383\nfiinu@agencybrazil.com\nFor more information, please visit\nwww.fiinuplc.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Upon the publication of this announcement via the Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n23 December 2025\nFiinu Plc\n(\"Fiinu\", the \"Company\" or the \"Group\")\nOperational Update\nWhite-Label update\nFiinu Plc (AIM: BANK), the fintech group and creator of the Plugin Overdraft\u00ae, announces an operational update in respect of continued progress on its Plugin Overdraft\u00ae white-label partnership with Conister Bank Limited (\"Conister Bank\"), a subsidiary of Manx Financial Group Plc (\"MFX\"), and additional white-label engagement and platform testing in Europe.\nConister Bank White-Label Partnership\nThe Company continues to make constructive progress on its white-label partnership with Conister Bank, with the project reaching a number of important milestones. These include, among other developments, Conister Bank having just received regulatory approval, the commencement of user acceptance testing within Fiinu's production environment for the Conister Bank Plugin Overdraft, powered by Fiinu.\nBoth parties continue to work through a defined set of remaining deliverables required ahead of launch. These include, among other matters, the progression of a payment solution. As a result, and following joint planning discussions,\nsubject to the completion of these items, the parties are now targeting a launch in Q1 2026. As with any regulated financial product, timing remains subject to third-party dependencies.\nBoth parties remain fully engaged and positive regarding the partnership and the forthcoming launch. The Company confirms that, while there are outstanding actions on both sides, there are currently no known insurmountable technical or operational issues that would prevent launch within the expected timeframe.\nAdditional White-Label Engagements and Platform Testing\nIn parallel with its work with Conister Bank, the Company continues to engage in discussions with a number of other European banks regarding potential white-label deployments of the Plugin Overdraft\u00ae platform. As part of these engagements, Fiinu has commenced early-stage platform testing activities with prospective partners in two EU jurisdictions. These activities are focused on validating technical integration, localisation requirements and regulatory alignment within differing European banking environments.\nWhile these discussions and testing programmes remain at an exploratory and non-binding stage, the Company believes they demonstrate growing interest from European banking institutions in Fiinu's technology and its potential applicability across multiple regulated markets. There can be no certainty that these discussions will result in formal commercial agreements, and any future progress remains subject to regulatory approvals and partner decision-making processes.\nDr Marko Sjoblom, CEO of Fiinu Plc, commented:\n\"We continue to make steady and constructive progress with Conister Bank on the development of the Plugin Overdraft\u00ae as a white-label solution, with a number of important milestones now achieved, including regulatory approval and commencement of user acceptance testing in our production environment. While there remain defined deliverables to complete ahead of launch, including third-party dependencies, both teams remain fully engaged and aligned on the path forward.\n\"In parallel, we are encouraged by the level of inbound interest from other European banks and by the early-stage platform testing currently underway in two EU jurisdictions. These activities are focused on validating the adaptability of our technology across different regulatory and operational environments. Although these engagements remain exploratory and non-binding, they underline the broader relevance of our platform and support our confidence in Fiinu's longer-term commercial strategy. As always, progress remains subject to regulatory processes and partner decision-making.\"\nThe Directors of the Company are responsible for the release of this announcement.\n*ENDS*\nFor further information, please contact:\nFiinu Plc\nDr. Marko Sjoblom - CEO\nTel: +44 (0) 1932 629 532\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nomad)\nMark Brady / Angus Campbell\nTel: +44 (0) 203 368 3550\nEmail:\nfiinu@sparkapl.com\nMarex Financial (Joint Broker)\nAngelo Sofocleous / Keith Swann / Matt Bailey\nTel: +44 (0) 207 655 6000\nEmail:\ncorporate@marex.com\nOberon Investment Limited (Joint Broker)\nNick Lovering / Adam Pollock / Mike Seabrook\nTel: +44 (0)203 179 5300\nBrazil (Financial PR)\nJoshua van Raalte / Jamie Lester /Christine Webb\nTel: +44 (0) 207 785 7383\nFor more information, please visit\nwww.fiinuplc.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

These include, among other developments, Conister Bank having just received regulatory approval, the commencement of user acceptance testing within Fiinu's production environment for the Conister Bank Plugin Overdraft, powered by Fiinu.\nBoth parties continue to work through a defined set of remaining deliverables required ahead of launch. These include, among other matters, the progression of a payment solution. As a result, and following joint planning discussions,\nsubject to the completion of these items, the parties are now targeting a launch in Q1 2026. As with any regulated financial product, timing remains subject to third-party dependencies.\nBoth parties remain fully engaged and positive regarding the partnership and the forthcoming launch. The Company confirms that, while there are outstanding actions on both sides, there are currently no known insurmountable technical or operational issues that would prevent launch within the expected timeframe.\nAdditional White-Label Engagements and Platform Testing\nIn parallel with its work with Conister Bank, the Company continues to engage in discussions with a number of other European banks regarding potential white-label deployments of the Plugin Overdraft\u00ae platform. As part of these engagements, Fiinu has commenced early-stage platform testing activities with prospective partners in two EU jurisdictions. These activities are focused on validating technical integration, localisation requirements and regulatory alignment within differing European banking environments.\nWhile these discussions and testing programmes remain at an exploratory and non-binding stage, the Company believes they demonstrate growing interest from European banking institutions in Fiinu's technology and its potential applicability across multiple regulated markets. There can be no certainty that these discussions will result in formal commercial agreements, and any future progress remains subject to regulatory approvals and partner decision-making processes.\nDr Marko Sjoblom, CEO of Fiinu Plc, commented:\n\"We continue to make steady and constructive progress with Conister Bank on the development of the Plugin Overdraft\u00ae as a white-label solution, with a number of important milestones now achieved, including regulatory approval and commencement of user acceptance testing in our production environment. While there remain defined deliverables to complete ahead of launch, including third-party dependencies, both teams remain fully engaged and aligned on the path forward.\n\"In parallel, we are encouraged by the level of inbound interest from other European banks and by the early-stage platform testing currently underway in two EU jurisdictions.

This conversion price, of 10p per new ordinary share, was negotiated some time ago when Fiinu's share price was below 10p, and therefore reflects market conditions at that time. With Fiinu's shares currently trading at a premium to the agreed conversion price, the arrangement underscores both the financial flexibility of the facility and the strategic importance of the partnership between Fiinu and Manx Financial Group.\nAny shares issued pursuant to the conversion of the Loan will rank\npari passu\nwith the Company's existing ordinary shares and will be admitted to trading on AIM. The proceeds from the Loan will be used to support the Company's\nworking capital requirements\nand to drive growth in Fiinu's businesses.\nCommenting on the Agreement\nDr Marko Sjoblom, CEO of Fiinu Plc, said:\n\"We are pleased to have secured this flexible financing arrangement with Conister, which not only strengthens our capital position but also provides us with additional working capital support for our fast-growing FX brokerage in Poland. We expect the Loan to be converted in due course, which will see Manx Financial Group, through Conister Bank, become a strategic investor in Fiinu.\"\nDouglas Grant, Managing Director of Conister Bank and CEO of Manx Financial Group PLC, added:\n\"This facility is part of the Group's strategy to enhance its lending technology by integrating with experienced market-leading product providers. The optionality within this facility also allows the Group to generate a return greater than debt interest alone, while positioning Manx Financial Group as a strategic partner with Fiinu.\"\nFurther announcements will be made as appropriate.\nThe Directors of the Company are responsible for the release of this announcement\n*ENDS*\nFor further information, please contact:\nFiinu Plc\nDr. Marko Sjoblom - CEO\nTel: +44 (0) 1932 629 532\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nomad)\nMark Brady/Jade Bayat\nTel: +44 (0) 203 368 3550\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP (Joint Broker)\nBruce Fraser/Ezgi Senturk\nTel: +44 (0) 207 47 0470\nOberon Investment Limited (Joint Broker)\nNick Lovering/ Adam Pollock/ Mike Seabrook\nTel: +44 (0)203 179 5300\nBrazil (Financial PR)\nJoshua van Raalte /Jamie Lester/Christine Webb\nTel: +44 (0) 207 785 7383\nFor more information, please visit\nwww.fiinuplc.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Fiinu's bank-agnostic overdraft platform, powered by AI, was originally developed and audited for Fiinu Bank in the UK.\nIt enables customers of any UK bank to 'plugin' a Conister Bank overdraft to their primary current account, without anyone needing to switch banks.\nThe solution can technically access over 100 million personal current accounts in the UK and 95% of EU bank accounts.

This foundation has evolved into a proprietary AI-driven underwriting engine that makes overdrafts responsibly available across the UK's 100 million+ personal current accounts and can scale seamlessly across thousands of banks in the EU.

This equates to a termination payment of \u00a31.15 million.\nAs part of the Deed of Termination:\nAll outstanding warrants previously granted to GEM have been cancelled, removing the warrant overhang from Fiinu's capital structure.\nGEM has also agreed to a 30-day lock-in on the Settlement Shares, followed by orderly market provisions to ensure measured trading thereafter.\nApplication will be made to the London Stock Exchange for the Settlement Shares to be admitted to trading on AIM.\nThe Company has the authority to issue and allot the Subscription Shares pursuant to certain existing shareholder authorities granting such powers to the directors at the Company's Annual General Meeting held on 26 June 2025.

The Company does not hold any ordinary shares in Treasury, therefore the total voting rights in the Company following Admission will be 385,541,653.

Together with the recent addition of Everfex to the Group and good progress on the licensing of our Plugin Overdraft\u00ae, it marks the completion of another of the many strategic objectives the board has set itself for the remainder of 2025 and 2026.

There is a substantial market opportunity for the Group in the UK alone, with over 29 million potential retail consumers who may consider adding the Plugin Overdraft\u00ae to their bank account as long as they do not have to switch their main bank (based on the Company's internal research conducted in 2019). The Group's Plugin Overdraft\u00ae platform can provide retail customers with an overdraft facility without switching banks, giving them access to mainstream credit, which can improve their credit scores and help avoid expensive late payment fees. This removes the major friction and inertia in banking where consumers do not want to switch banks, and the solution improves financial inclusion.\nThe Group's strategy since the completion of the Fiinu reverse takeover, financing, and re-admission of its Ordinary Shares to AIM on 8 July 2022 had been to progress the technical development of its Plugin Overdraft\u00ae platform and Fiinu 2 to undergo the Bank of England 12-month mobilisation programme. The mobilisation included development, an independent audit of the technology platform and preparation for full operational readiness to launch the Fiinu bank. The Company was ready to submit the Variation of Permission documents to the PRA / FCA to lift Fiinu 2's deposit taking restrictions. However, challenging fundraising market conditions in 2023 prevented the Company from raising all the necessary funds required by the PRA (as regulatory and operational capital) to exit the mobilisation programme and obtain an unrestricted banking licence. Accordingly, during the second half of 2023, the Group surrendered its banking licence to the PRA and undertook a cost reduction exercise (by reducing staffing levels, including board members, and renegotiating or terminating agreements with suppliers) to preserve cash resources whilst maintaining the Group's core banking technology. As part of this scaling-back process, the Group has preserved the integrity of its technology and its intellectual property, infrastructure and regulatory documentation. This forms the basis of the Group's current operations, which comprise the following:\n\u00b7\nPlugin Overdraft\u00ae platform: The Group's flagship product, the Plugin Overdraft\u00ae, is a personal finance management solution, as referred to above. It provides consumers with flexible overdraft credit solutions that integrate directly into existing banking applications. This service allows users to access an overdraft facility seamlessly without a need to change their bank.\n\u00b7\nBanking as a Service (BaaS): Fiinu is also seeking to provide a turnkey BaaS platform and customer support offering that enables third-party financial institutions to launch their own banking products quickly and efficiently. This solution supports a variety of services, from payment processing to lending, thereby allowing partners to enhance their customer offerings with minimal operational overhead.\n\u00b7\nAI-Driven Underwriting: The Group has developed advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to enhance the underwriting processes related to the provision of a Plugin Overdraft\u00ae to consumers. The Group uses models such as artificial neural networks and Markov chains to ensure more accurate credit assessments and quicker decision-making, thereby improving the user experience. The underwriting can be offered as part of the platform or on a stand-alone basis.\nOn 15 January 2025, the Company announced that it had signed non-binding heads of terms for its first white label deal for its Plugin Overdraft\u00ae product with an independent UK bank, pursuant to which the Group would provide the bank with its BaaS platform incorporating the Plugin Overdraft\u00ae product. The launch Is anticipated during Q4 2025.\nAbout Everfex\nEverfex is a recently incorporated company, that acquired the business, trade and certain assets of Sta\u0142y Kurs on 1 January 2025. As part of the Sta\u0142y Kurs acquisition, Everfex purchased the right to use the Sta\u0142y Kurs name and will",

Additionally, Fiinu has also issued 500,000 new ordinary shares at 10 pence per share (\"Adviser Shares\") to settle outstanding fees owed to the Company's Nominated Adviser, SPARK Advisory Partners Limited (\"SPARK\").\nDirector Shares\nDavid Hopton has agreed to take deferred income of \u00a3211,774 through the issue of 2,117,740 new ordinary shares at a price of 10 pence per share.\nFollowing the issue of these shares, and the Adviser Shares, David Hopton's total beneficial interest in the Company is 3,514,065 ordinary shares, representing approximately 1.21% of the Company's issued share capital.\nRelated Party Transaction\nDavid Hopton is a Director of the Company and therefore considered a related party under the AIM Rules. As the issue of equity in lieu of fees is considered to be outside the terms of his agreement with the Company, the issue of 2,117,740 new ordinary shares to David Hopton is considered to be a related party transaction. The Independent Directors, being all Directors other than David Hopton, having consulted with SPARK, the Company's Nominated Adviser, believe that the terms of the issue of equity to Mr Hopton are fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned.\nAdviser Shares\nSPARK, the Company's Nominated Adviser, has agreed to accept 500,000 ordinary shares at a price of 10 pence per share in lieu of \u00a350,000 owed in outstanding fees.\nAdmission and Total Voting Rights\nApplication will be made for the admission of the Director Shares and Adviser Shares to trading on AIM, which is expected to become effective on or about 12 August 2025.\nFollowing admission of the Director and Adviser Shares, the total issued share capital of the Company will consist of 289,864,986 ordinary shares of 10 pence each. The Company does not hold any ordinary shares in Treasury, therefore the total voting rights in the Company following Admission will be 289,864,986. This figure may be used by shareholders in the Company as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change in their interest in, the share capital of the Company under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nAdditional information\nThe following disclosures are made in accordance with the requirements of the UK Market Abuse Regulation and provide detail in relation to the purchase of Ordinary Shares by Directors and other PDMRs in the Company.\nNOTIFICATIONS AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF TRANSACTIONS BY PERSONS DISCHARGING MANAGERIAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND PERSONS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THEM\n1\nDetails of the person discharging managerial responsibilities/person closely associated\na)\nName\nDavid Hopton\n2\nReason for the notification\na)\nPosition/status\nNon-Executive Chairman\nb)\nInitial notification/Amendment\nInitial Notification\n3\nDetails of the issuer, emission allowance market participant, auction platform, auctioneer or auction monitor\na)\nName\nFiinu plc\nb)\nLEI\n213800XSRH9SNN1EXX92\n4\nDetails of the transaction(s): section to be repeated for (i) each type of instrument; (ii) each type of transaction; (iii) each date; and (iv) each place where transactions have been conducted\na)\nDescription of the financial instrument, type of instrument\nOrdinary Shares of Fiinu plc\nISIN GB0033881904\nb)\nNature of the transaction\nIssuance of ordinary shares in settlement of cash fees\nc)\nPrice(s) and volume(s)\nPrice\nVolume\n10 pence\n2,117,740\nordinary shares\nd)\nAggregated information\n-\nAggregated volume\n-\nPrice\nPrice\nAggregate Volume\n10 pence\n2,117,740\nordinary shares\ne)\nDate of the transaction\n7 August 2025\nf)\nPlace of the transaction\nOff market\nFurther announcements will be made as appropriate.\nFiinu Plc\nDr. Marko Sjoblom - CEO\nTel: +44 (0) 1932 629 532\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nomad)\nMark Brady/Jade Bayat\nTel: +44 (0) 203 368 3550\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP (Joint Broker)\nBruce Fraser/Ezgi Senturk\nTel: +44 (0) 207 470 0470\nOberon Investments Limited (Joint Broker)\nNick Lovering/ Adam Pollock/ Mike Seabrook\nTel: +44 (0)203 179 5300\nBrazil (Financial PR)\nJoshua van Raalte/Jamie Lester/Christine Webb\nTel: +44 (0) ",

Upon the publication of this Announcement via the Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n6 August 2025\nFiinu Plc\n(\"\nFiinu\n\" or \"\nthe Group\n\" or \"\nthe Company\n\")\nProposed Acquisition and\nProposed Subscription to raise c.\u00a30.8 million\nTemporary Suspension of Trading in the Company's ordinary shares on AIM\nThe Directors of Fiinu Plc (AIM: BANK) are pleased to announce the proposed acquisition of Everfex P.S.A. (\"\nEverfex\n\") for an aggregate total consideration of up to \u00a312.0 million (\"\nProposed Acquisition\n\"). The initial consideration, of \u00a38.0 million, is to be satis\ufb01ed through the issue of 80,000,000 new ordinary shares in the capital of the Company (\"\nConsideration Shares\n\") to the sole owner of Everfex, Granicus Holdings O.\u00dc (\"\nGranicus Holdings\n\"), at a price of 10p per Consideration Share (the \"\nIssue Price\n\"). Additional consideration of \u00a34.0\u00a0million may be payable, subsequent to 1 January 2026, if Everfex achieves certain performance criteria, which would be satisfied through the issue of 20,000,000 new ordinary shares in the Company (\"\nAdditional Consideration Shares\n\") at an issue price of 20p per Additional Consideration Share.\nIn addition, the Company intends to raise approximately \u00a30.8 million, by way of a conditional subscription (\"\nSubscription\n\") of new ordinary shares in the capital of the Company (\"\nSubscription Shares\n\") at the Issue Price.\nThe Proposed Acquisition, if completed, will constitute a reverse takeover of the Company under the AIM Rules\u00a0and is, therefore, subject to the approval of the Company's shareholders in General Meeting. The Proposed Acquisition is subject to shareholder approval and it is proposed that the enlarged issued share capital of the Company will be admitted to trading on AIM (\"\nAdmission\n\").\nAbout Everfex:\n\u00b7\nEverfex\nis an FX brokerage firm which executed over $1 billion in spot, swap, and forward contracts traded in 2024.\n\u00b7\nIt is a profitable and scalable business, with unaudited results showing over \u00a3600,000 profit before tax for the four-month period ending 30 April 2025. In addition its SME client base grew 1,300% in 2024.\n\u00b7\nEverfex is a recently incorporated company that acquired the business, trade and certain assets of Sta\u0142y Kurs sp. z.o.o. (\"\nSta\u0142y Kurs\n\") on 1 January 2025. As part of the Sta\u0142y Kurs acquisition, Everfex purchased the right to use the Sta\u0142y Kurs name and will continue to trade as Sta\u0142y Kurs in Poland.\n\u00b7\nSta\u0142y Kurs was established in September 2019, in Poland, to provide currency hedging solutions. The business serves small and medium-sized businesses exposed to Polish Zloty \ufb02uctuations against all major currencies. Over the years Sta\u0142y Kurs had developed into a key player in the Polish market, specialising in supporting import and export businesses with currency exchange.\n\u00b7\nSta\u0142y Kurs has demonstrated year-on-year growth in revenue and pro\ufb01tability, primarily driven by the expansion of its client base and improved operational ef\ufb01ciency.\n\u00b7\nAt the end of Q2 2023, a new management team, led by CEO, Karol Oleksa, restructured aspects of the Sta\u0142y Kurs business and introduced a more robust governance and risk management framework. As part of this restructuring the previous CEO left the business in Q2 2023, and sold his shareholding in Sta\u0142y Kurs.\n\u00b7\nIn late 2024, the business underwent a restructuring in preparation for its transfer to Everfex, and in July 2025 the then owners of Everfex (being the Bene\ufb01cial Owners) transferred Everfex to Granicus Holdings, which entity has entered into the sale and purchase agreement (the \"\nAcquisition Agreement\n\") for the sale of Everfex to the Company.\n\u00b7\nWhilst Everfex has experienced good traction and recent growth in the SME market, it intends to broaden its service offering into regulated foreign exchange payment services. As part of this service offering expansion, Everfex is considering obtaining the necessary licences, in order to enable it to provide additional brokerage and payments services.\nProposed Fundraising:\n\u00b7\nThe Company is seeking to raise approximately \u00a30.8 million by way of a conditional cash subscription through the issue of Subscription Shares at the Issue Price.\n\u00b7\nFollow",

This figure may be used by shareholders in the Company as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change in their interest in, the share capital of the Company under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nThe Directors of the Company are responsible for the release of this announcement\n*ENDS*\nFor further information, please contact:\nFiinu Plc\nDr. Marko Sjoblom,\nmarko@fiinu.com\nTel: +44 (0)1932 629 582\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nomad)\nMark Brady / Jade Bayat\nTel: +44 (0) 203 368 3550\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP (Joint Broker)\nBruce Fraser / Ezgi Senturk\nTel: +44 (0) 207 470 0470\nOberon Capital (Joint Broker)\nNick Lovering / Adam Pollock\nTel: +44 (0)203 179 5355\nAbout Fiinu\nFiinu, founded in 2017, is a fintech group that has developed the Plugin Overdraft\u00ae, an unbundled overdraft solution that allows customers to have an overdraft without changing their existing bank. The underlying bank Independent Overdraft\u00ae technology platform is bank agnostic, enabling it to serve all other banks' customers. The Plugin Overdraft\u00ae platform can technically access over 100 million bank accounts in the UK. Open Banking allows Fiinu's Plugin Overdraft\u00ae to attach (\"plugin\") to the customer's existing primary bank account, no matter which bank they may use.

Upon the publication of this announcement via a Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n15 January 2025\nFiinu Plc\n(\"Fiinu\", the \"Company\" or the \"Group\")\nFiinu signs heads of terms for its first white-label BaaS deal with a UK Bank\nFiinu, a fintech group and creator of the Plugin Overdraft\u00ae, announced today that it has entered into non-binding heads of terms for its first white-label deal for its flagship Plugin Overdraft\u00ae product with an independent UK bank.\nThis collaboration will see Fiinu provide the bank with its AI advanced white-label Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform, incorporating its Plugin Overdraft\n\u00d2\nproduct. The Bank Independent Overdraft\n\u00d2\nplatform will fully integrate into the bank's existing treasury, regulatory reporting and accounting systems. Initially documented in Heads of Terms, this agreement represents a key milestone in Fiinu's growth strategy and is the culmination of nearly 12 months of discussions between the parties.\nConditions and Next Steps:\nThe Heads of Terms are subject to contract, including any necessary regulatory approvals, executing a Master Service Agreement (MSA) and Service Level Agreement (SLA) for Fiinu to provide a turnkey technology solution including, but not limited to, ongoing customer support. The partnership's success is contingent upon the timely completion of these prerequisites and testing of the systems and interfaces. The parties have agreed to an exclusivity period of 12 months for the UK from the go-live date. The final product specifications must also be confirmed before any formal agreement is entered into. The UK bank is expected to launch the product during Q4 2025. Once launched, Fiinu will receive royalty fees from the bank's audited profits from the Plugin Overdraft\u00ae.\nFurther announcements will be made as appropriate.\nDr Marko Sjoblom, CEO of Fiinu plc, commented:\n\"We believe our Plugin Overdraft\u00ae platform is a valuable asset, and we remain committed to unlocking the full value of our proprietary intellectual property and AI offerings in a manner that aligns with the market's needs and long-term objectives. We are firm believers in Open Banking-enabled technology for unbundling financial services through the innovative application of AI. By way of example, our Plugin Overdraft AI underwriting agent benefits from artificial neural networks (ANN) and\u00a0Markov chains (MC), which has led to the development of a\u00a0new ANN-MC\u00a0underwriting model.\nFrom a strategic perspective, we maintain conversations with other banks outside the UK. We are also continuing discussions to secure Fiinu Bank's regulatory capital.\nThis strategic collaboration marks a pivotal step in Fiinu's journey. The partnership is a testament to the innovation and value of our BaaS platform and its potential to transform the banking experience. We look forward to working closely with our partner as we work towards delivering groundbreaking banking solutions to customers across the UK.\"\nForward-Looking Statements:\nThis announcement contains forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially due to various factors, including but not limited to delays in regulatory approval, unforeseen difficulties in the integration process, and changing market conditions.\nEnquiries:\nFiinu Plc\nDr. Marko Sjoblom,\nmarko@fiinu.com\nTel: +44 (0)1932\n629 582\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nomad)\nMark Brady / Jade Bayat\nTel: +44 (0) 203 368 3550\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP (Joint Broker)\nBruce Fraser / Ezgi Senturk\nTel: +44 (0) 207 470 0470\nOberon Investments Ltd\n(Joint Broker)\nNick Lovering\nTel:\n+44\u00a0(0)\u00a020\u00a03179\u00a05355\nAbout Fiinu\nFiinu, founded in 2017, is a fintech group that has developed the Plugin Overdraft\u00ae, an unbundled overdraft solution that allows customers to have an overdraft without changing their existing bank.

This information will be in the public domain upon publication of this announcement.\nFIINU\nPLC\n(\"Fiinu\" or the \"Company\" or the\n\"Group\")\nHalf-Year results for the six months ended 30 June\n2024\nFiinu, a fintech group\nand\ncreator of the Plugin Overdraft\u00ae, announces its unaudited half-year results for the six months ended 30 June 2024.\nOperational Update\n\u00b7\nThe Company has successfully completed all its previously announced cost-cutting programmes, leading to a much-reduced loss before taxation.\n\u00b7\nThe Plugin Overdraft platform's intellectual property, documentation and source code remain boxed in a secured data warehouse, as previously announced. The Plugin Overdraft\u00ae platform can technically access over 100 million bank accounts in the UK.\n\u00b7\nDuring the period, the Company has continued funding conversations with potential investors.\n\u00b7\nIn addition, the Company continues to discuss providing white-labelling services to other banks and licensing Fiinu's Plugin Overdraft technology platform.\nFinancial\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nLoss before taxation is reduced by 95% from the same period last year to approximately \u00a30.24m (2023: \u00a34.41m). Cash at\nbank on 30 June 2024\nwas approximately \u00a30.7m. Since the period end, as in the past six years, the Company has submitted a file for a research & development tax credit, for approximately \u00a30.6m.\n\u00b7\nThe Board remains confident in its ability to trade as a going concern\n.\nThe Board has the main shareholder support, the operating losses have been reduced, and the monthly burn rate is being managed effectively with existing liquidity.\nOutlook\n\u00b7\nIn addition to continuing to look to secure the funding required to enable it to re-visit its application for a UK Banking Licence and potential white-labelling or licensing opportunities, the Board remains open to exploring corporate transactions with other complementary businesses in the fintech or banking arena.\n\u00b7\nThe ideal targets should have strategic and business ethics that synergise with Fiinu's proposition, corporate culture, and values, such as improving financial inclusion through innovative use of open banking-enabled technologies and pan-European expansion ambitions.\nDr Marko Sjoblom, Fiinu CEO, commented:\n\"I am pleased to report that the Company has made significant strides towards achieving financial stability. The successful completion of our cost-cutting initiatives is a major milestone, resulting in a 95% reduction in losses compared to the same period last year. This disciplined approach to financial management has allowed us to protect our cash position and maintain sufficient liquidity to support ongoing operations, including our efforts to secure additional funding.\n\"Our Plugin Overdraft\u00ae platform, which can technically access over 100 million UK bank accounts, remains a core asset. While our intellectual property, documentation, and source code are securely stored, we continue to explore strategic opportunities for white-labelling services and licensing of this unique platform technology. These discussions are ongoing and reflect our commitment to unlocking the full value of our proprietary offerings in a manner that aligns with the market's needs and our long-term objectives.\n\"From a strategic perspective, we are maintaining conversations with potential investors to secure additional funding.

I am committed to making things even better for Fiinu.\n\"In the short term, as well as continuing to seek interim and conditional funding to allow us to rehire key staff and ultimately re-apply for our banking licence, we will explore new avenues for revenue, such as technology white-labelling and joint venture opportunities. These opportunities, which were always in our strategy, would allow us to generate immediate banking-as-a-service licencing revenue, prove the product market fit and that the technology works but also, pave the way for our long-term ambitions for Fiinu Bank.\n\"These initiatives, coupled with our unwavering commitment to financial inclusion, should ultimately drive our Company's share price higher and solidify our position as a disruptor in the banking landscape.

As stated in recent public announcements, while the team succeeded in getting to a position where we could attest to the Regulators the operational readiness of Fiinu Bank, we were unable to give the Regulators a definitive attestation that we had raised the regulatory capital required to exit mobilisation; consequently, we were left with no choice but to return our banking licence.\nDespite this setback, we remain steadfast in our commitment to playing our part in revolutionising banking services by providing the underserved with our Plugin Overdraft\u00ae. We believe that millions of customers will eventually benefit from this product, which Fiinu remains committed to bringing to the market. I must, however, acknowledge that we still have work to do before reapplying for our banking licence.\nBeing unable to raise exit capital was a huge disappointment and, as a result, we had to resort to a cost-cutting programme to preserve our options. However, I want to acknowledge that it was no small achievement to have been able to attest to the accomplishment of all the other conditions set by the PRA and the FCA to exit mobilisation. As a result of being so close to achieving our most important strategic goal, the Board has stated its intention to continue to pursue our chosen strategy and to seek to raise the required funding to reapply for ",

The Company can confirm that Jerry Loy, Huw Evans and Chris Sweeney will step down from the Company's Board with effect from 31 December 2023. David Hopton has now agreed to remain as Non-executive Chairman, but has agreed to defer his remuneration subject to raising sufficient capital to re-apply for a banking licence.\nFrom 1 January 2024, the Company's Board of Directors will consist of David Hopton (Non-executive Chairman), Simon Leathers (Senior Independent Non-executive Director) and Marko Sjoblom (Founder and Executive Director); Marko will be appointed as Group CEO from that date with his remuneration being deferred, subject to the Company being successful with the re-application process. The Company will also look to recruit further independent non-executive directors, as appropriate, to satisfy its corporate governance requirements. Further announcements will be made as appropriate.\nChange of Auditor\nMazars LLP has stepped down as auditors following the decision by the Company to appoint an audit firm that is aligned to the current stage of the Company's development. F. W. Smith, Riches & Co (a member of MGI Worldwide) has been appointed by the Board as the Group's new independent auditor with immediate effect and will undertake the audit for the year-ending 31 December 2023.\nThe re-appointment of\nF. W. Smith, Riches & Co\nfor the financial year ending 31 December 2024 will be subject to approval by shareholders at the next Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held in 2024.\nMaintaining current strategy\nAs previously announced, the Board's focus remains on raising the necessary capital to support Fiinu 2 Limited's re-application for a UK banking licence with which to launch its Plugin Overdraft\u00ae. Given the steps taken to preserve existing funding, ahead of making the re-application in order to ensure the required level of technological and regulatory readiness for the business to re-initiate the process, a hiring process will need to be undertaken by the Board. It is not possible at this time to quantify the time period when this will happen.\nFurther funding requirements\nThe Company will continue to review all its options in respect of the business, including further discussions to source the additional funding required for it to re-apply to the regulators to re-commence the banking licence application for Fiinu 2 Limited. As part of the continued review of its cashflow requirements, the Company will look to raise further funding to support at least the 12-month period from the issuance of the 31 December 2023 Report and Accounts, whilst it seeks to raise the capital for the re-application process. As previously announced the required capital for the re-application process is between \u00a335m - \u00a342m. Further announcements in respect of the interim funding requirements will be made in due course.\nFuture Intentions and Strategy\nOn 29 September 2023, the Company announced an operational and strategic update. The Company does not intend to change the current strategy and will announce any further updates in due course.\nAny fundamental change of strategy that involves the cessation of operations, or the sale of all or substantially all of the Group's business and assets (for example, the Group's technology stack and other intellectual property) would require the approval of shareholders in a general meeting in compliance with AIM Rule 15, but no decision to take this course of action has been made.\nCommenting, David Hopton, Chairman of Fiinu, said:\n\"Although, in the current economic climate, the Directors believe there is a definite need for the\nPlugin Overdraft\u00ae\nto support customers with their credit needs, funding conditions have remained challenging for businesses at the pre-revenue stage such as Fiinu.\n\"In such conditions, the Board have had to take some difficult decisions to preserve cash and to give the Company every chance to source the additional funding required for it to re-apply to the regulators to re-commence the banking licence application for Fiinu 2 Limited. The proposed Board changes are also being made to reduce ongoing costs to preserve cash. I would like to put on record the Board's and my own thanks to Chris Sweeney for his tireless efforts to get the Group to the position where, subject to funding being raised, it can relatively quickly re-apply for a banking licence. On behalf of all the Board, I wish Chris and all his colleagues who have left Fiinu well for their fut",

It also stated that it had submitted (and had accepted by the regulators) an application to withdraw its banking licence with the aim of re-applying after a short period once exit funding had been secured. These funding challenges have continued over the summer and, whilst the Company remains engaged in a number of live discussions with potential investors, none of them has advanced sufficiently at this point to enable Fiinu 2 Limited to make a re-application for its banking licence.\nCash resources\nAs announced on 12 July 2023, the Company initiated controlled cost reductions at its subsidiaries, Fiinu 2 Limited and Fiinu Holdings Limited. By reducing costs in Fiinu 2 Limited and Fiinu Holdings Limited, the balance of resources available to the Company and across the Group are providing additional time to determine the best way forward for shareholders for the current or potential alternative strategy.\nThese cost reductions have proceeded according to the Company's detailed plan and remain on track. As at 28 September 2023, the Group had available unaudited cash resources of approximately \u00a31.9 million, having repaid the \u00a3750,000 principal (and unpaid interest of \u00a37k) outstanding on the Dewscope Loan, originally entered into on 15 June 2022, as amended on 14 March 2023. The amount remaining represents enough funds to enable the Group to scale back its current operations in Fiinu 2 Limited and Fiinu Holdings Limited and continue to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.\nMaintain strategy\nThe Board plans to continue with its cost reduction process, which will accelerate from now until the end of the financial year, to preserve the integrity of its technology intellectual property, infrastructure and regulatory documentation, but will reduce headcount significantly to preserve cash.\nThis will ensure that Fiinu 2 Limited is in a position to commence the re-application for its banking licence when the Company has secured the required funding. However, ahead of making the re-application and to ensure the required level of technological and regulatory readiness for the business to re-initiate the process, a hiring process will need to be undertaken by the Board. It is not possible at this time to quantify the time period.\nCertain members of the Board of Fiinu 2 Limited and the Company have now been served notice to reduce future operating costs, in line with the Company's cost reduction plan, and will step down as directors on 31 December 2023. Further details are set out below.\nTo provide further continuity of knowledge, all the non-executive directors of Fiinu 2 Limited will be retained on a consultancy basis, at no cost, and be available to support the future fundraising efforts, as well as support any engagements with the regulators when required.\nBoard announcements\nDavid Hopton, Jerry Loy, and Huw Evans will leave the Company's Board on 31 December 2023, in the absence of any new potential funding developments. All have agreed to remain after this time in an advisory capacity to support future fundraising activities and assist with any future engagement with the regulators should that be required. Chris Sweeney, Group CEO, and CEO of Fiinu 2 Limited, has also been served notice as planned and will step down as a Director of all the Group companies on 31 December 2023.\nFrom 31 December 2023, in the absence of any funding developments and/or additional board appointments, the Company's Board of Directors will consist of Simon Leathers (Senior Independent Non-executive Director) and Marko Sjoblom (Founder and Executive Director), who will be appointed as Group CEO from that date during the fund-raising period with deferred remuneration subject to being successful with the re-application process. The Company will also look to recruit further independent non-executive directors, as appropriate, to satisfy its corporate governance requirements. Further announcements will be made as appropriate.\nFurther funding requirements\nThe Company will continue to review all its options in respect of the business, including further discussions to source the additional funding required for it to re-apply to the regulators to re-commence the banking licence application for Fiinu 2 Limited. As part of the continued review of its cashflow requirements, the Company will look to raise further funding to support at least the",

As a result of these difficult market conditions, it also stated that it had submitted an application to the regulators to withdraw its banking licence with the aim of re-applying after a short period of two to three months once exit funding had been secured. The Company can confirm that the application by its subsidiary to withdraw its restricted banking licence was accepted by the regulators and, due to the continuing challenging market conditions and limited timescale, it has not yet been able to secure the necessary exit funding to consider seeking re-application.\nGiven the ongoing expense of maintaining and enhancing the development of the operationally ready banking technology by Group companies, the Company has now determined that the best course of action for its shareholders is for cost reductions to be initiated at its subsidiaries, Fiinu 2 Limited and Fiinu Holdings Limited, by various means including providing notice to reduce staffing levels, the re-negotiation or termination of agreements with suppliers. By reducing costs and satisfying all outstanding debts and liabilities of Fiinu 2 Limited and Fiinu Holdings Limited, the balance of resources available to the Company and across the Group will be optimised as the best way forward for shareholders is determined.\nUnfortunately, due to the current circumstances the Company is unable to utilise the funding options announced on 15 March 2023 with Dewscope Limited and GEM Global Yield LLC SCS and GEM Yield Bahamas Limited.\nAs at 30 June 2023, the Group had available unaudited cash resources of approximately \u00a34.3m. This represents enough funds to enable the Group to scale back its current operations in Fiinu 2 Limited and Fiinu Holdings Limited and continue to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.\nWhilst Fiinu 2 Limited proceeds with the controlled scaling back of its operations, which may take a number of months, the Company will continue to review all its options in respect of the business, including trying to source the additional funding required for it to re-apply to the regulators to re-start its banking licence application, but also other options, which may include a change of strategy and/or a sale of the Group's technology assets. A change of strategy will include the Company's other subsidiary Fiinu Holdings Limited, which holds the intellectual property for the Group, and the Company.\nThe Company will make further announcements on progress and other developments as and when appropriate.\nCommenting on the proposals, Chris Sweeney, CEO of Fiinu, said:\n\"It is with deep regret that we have had to scale back operations in Fiinu 2 Limited and Fiinu Holdings Limited, following the successful completion of the technology build of the\nPlugin Overdraft\u00ae. The current\ngeneral capital, and market specific conditions, are increasingly challenging\nfor a business at Fiinu's current stage of development.\n\"I would like to take the opportunity to thank our shareholders for their support and colleagues for the considerable efforts in developing the technology and the infrastructure to be in a position to launch the product into the market. I would also like to thank the PRA and FCA for their continued support during these challenging times\n.\"\nMarket Abuse Regulation ('MAR') Disclosure\nCertain information contained in this announcement would have been deemed inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 ('MAR'), which is part of\nUK law by virtue of the\nEuropean Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, until the release of this announcement.\nENDS\nEnquiries:\nFiinu plc\nChris Sweeney, Chief Executive Officer\nwww.fiinu.com\nvia Brazil London (press office for Fiinu)\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nomad)\nMark Brady / Adam Dawes\nTel: +44 (0) 203 368 3550\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP (Joint Broker)\nMatthew Johnson / Charlie Bouverat (Corporate Finance)\nAbigail Wayne / Rob Rees (Corporate Broking)\nTel: +44 (0) 207 470 0470\nPanmure Gordon (UK) Limited (Joint Broker)\nStephen Jones / Atholl Tweedie (Corporate Finance)\nHugh Rich (Corporate Broking)\nTel: +44 (0)207 886 2500\nBrazil London (press office for Fiinu)\nJoshua Van Raalte / Christine Webb / Jamie Lester\nTel: +44 (0) 207 785 7383\nAbout Fiinu\nFiinu, founded in 2017, is a fintech group, that developed the Plugin Overdraft\u00ae which is an unbundled overdraft solution that allo",

Upon the publication of this announcement via the Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n22 January 2026\nFiinu Plc\n(\"Fiinu\", the \"Company\" or the \"Group\")\nEverfex Earn-out Update\nFiinu Plc (AIM: BANK) announces an update in respect of the earn-out condition relating to the acquisition of its Polish operating subsidiary, Everfex P.S.A. (\"Everfex\"), the completion of an independent verification of Everfex's SME client order book, and the commencement of recruitment for a Country Manager in Poland.\nPursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement dated 7 August 2025, an independent review of Everfex's SME client order book has been completed by an external professional adviser, applying the same methodology used during the pre-acquisition due diligence process. The review confirmed an aggregate order book of approximately \u20ac340 million as at 31 December 2025.\nThe earn-out condition required an aggregate order book of not less than \u20ac750 million at 31 December 2025. As this threshold was not met, none of the 20 million additional consideration shares will be issued to Granicus Holdings O\u0170.\nThe Board considers the independent verification process to be a positive validation of Fiinu's governance framework, methodological consistency, and commitment to external assurance. The confirmed \u20ac340 million of contracted and credit-approved SME orders demonstrates meaningful commercial traction and evidences credible demand for Fiinu's currency hedging and foreign exchange solutions within the Polish SME market.\nSince acquisition, Everfex has continued to strengthen its operating controls, enhance client quality, and deepen commercial relationships under the Group's current management. To support the next phase of execution and accelerate conversion of pipeline opportunities, Fiinu has commenced the recruitment of an experienced Country Manager for Poland. This appointment is expected to strengthen local leadership capability and support sustainable order book growth.\nDr Marko Sjoblom, Chief Executive Officer of Fiinu Plc, commented:\n\"The independently verified order book confirms a solid commercial foundation and growing demand among Polish SMEs. It reflects the disciplined, transparent approach Fiinu has applied since acquiring Everfex and provides a strong platform for future growth. With the recruitment of a Country Manager underway and continued execution focus across the Group, we believe Fiinu is well positioned to build long-term shareholder value.\"\nThe Directors of the Company are responsible for the release of this announcement.\n*ENDS*\nFor further information, please contact:\nFiinu Plc\nDr. Marko Sjoblom - CEO\nTel: +44 (0) 1932 629 532\nir@fiinu.com\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nomad)\nMark Brady / Angus Campbell\nTel: +44 (0) 203 368 3550/3551\nEmail:\nfiinu@sparkapl.com\nMarex Financial (Joint Broker)\nAngelo Sofocleous / Keith Swann / Matt Bailey\nTel: +44 (0) 207 655 6000\nEmail:\ncorporate@marex.com\nOberon Investment Limited (Joint Broker)\nNick Lovering / Adam Pollock / Mike Seabrook\nTel: +44 (0)203 179 5300\nBrazil (Financial PR)\nJoshua van Raalte / Christine Webb\nTel: +44 (0) 207 785 7383\nfiinu@agencybrazil.com\nFor more information, please visit\nwww.fiinuplc.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

This conversion price, of 10p per new ordinary share, was negotiated some time ago when Fiinu's share price was below 10p, and therefore reflects market conditions at that time. With Fiinu's shares currently trading at a premium to the agreed conversion price, the arrangement underscores both the financial flexibility of the facility and the strategic importance of the partnership between Fiinu and Manx Financial Group\" It was a while ago that the SP was trading below 10p, and if negotiated then, why wasn't it disclosed then? Why does a CLN that Conister convert anytime at an SP lower than the current one (so profiting the difference straightaway if they sold) underscore the financial flexibility of the facility? If Fiinu could convert at a premium if they wanted, so saving the interest, then yes. This CLN just looks like Conister get the penny and the bun and seems to be another demonstration of the unequal weighting of this partnership to me. A CLN at a low interest rate and with a big conversion price would be a better example, surely?",

This conversion price, of 10p per new ordinary share, was negotiated some time ago when Fiinu's share price was below 10p, and therefore reflects market conditions at that time. With Fiinu's shares currently trading at a premium to the agreed conversion price, the arrangement underscores both the financial flexibility of the facility and the strategic importance of the partnership between Fiinu and Manx Financial Group\" It was a while ago that the SP was trading below 10p, and if negotiated then, why wasn't it disclosed then? Why does a CLN that Conister convert anytime at an SP lower than the current one (so profiting the difference straightaway if they sold) underscore the financial flexibility of the facility? If Fiinu could convert at a premium if they wanted, so saving the interest, then yes. This CLN just looks like Conister get the penny and the bun and seems to be another demonstration of the unequal weighting of this partnership to me. A CLN at a low interest rate and with a big conversion price would be a better example, surely?",

(1M customers x \u00a3100 - \u00a3100M) If uptake is rapid then assuming 5% Net interest income (after funding) with estimated Credit losses of \u00a31.5M and Opex of \u00a31.2M the Operating Profit after launch could be around \u00a32.3M for the initial launch of the plug-in overdraft. That\u2019s a conservative estimate. If Plugin Overdraft balances scale quickly to \u00a3100m, BANK can generate base case \u00a33M-\u00a36m annual operating profit from that product alone. That level of profit: fundamentally changes the valuation, makes 15\u201320p fully diluted entirely plausible, makes the Everfex earn-out almost irrelevant by comparison. Just ignore if you want.",

That\u2019s a conservative estimate. If Plugin Overdraft balances scale quickly to \u00a3100m, BANK can generate base case \u00a33M-\u00a36m annual operating profit from that product alone. That level of profit: fundamentally changes the valuation, makes 15\u201320p fully diluted entirely plausible, makes the Everfex earn-out almost irrelevant by comparison. Just ignore if you want.",
