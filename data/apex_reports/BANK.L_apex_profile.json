The Company continues to engage with potential investors and it will make announcements accordingly.\nAs previously announced, the Board is maintaining its current strategy and its focus remains on raising the necessary capital to support Fiinu 2 Limited's re-application for a UK banking licence with which to launch its Plugin Overdraft\u00ae. Given the steps taken to preserve existing funding, ahead of making the re-application in order to ensure the required level of technological and regulatory readiness for the business to re-initiate the process, a hiring process will need to be undertaken by the Board. It is not possible at this time to quantify the time period when this will happen.\nENDS\nEnquiries:\nFiinu plc\nDr. Marko Sjoblom\nwww.fiinu.com\nvia SPARK\nSPARK Advisory Partners Limited (Nomad)\nMark Brady / Adam Dawes\nTel: +44 (0) 203 368 3550\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP (Joint Broker)\nBruce Fraser / Ezgi Senturk\nTel: +44 (0) 207 470 0470\nPanmure Gordon (UK) Limited (Joint Broker)\nStephen Jones / Atholl Tweedie (Corporate Finance)\nHugh Rich (Corporate Broking)\nTel: +44 (0)207 886 2500\nAbout Fiinu\nFiinu, founded in 2017, is a fintech group, that developed the Plugin Overdraft\u00ae which is an unbundled overdraft solution that allows customers to have an overdraft without changing their existing bank. The underlying bank Independent Plugin Overdraft\u00ae technology platform is bank agnostic, that therefore enables it to serve all other banks' customers. Open Banking allows Fiinu's Plugin Overdraft\u00ae to attach (\"plugin\") to the customer's existing primary bank account, no matter which bank they may use. Fiinu's vision is built around Open Banking, and it believes that it increases competition and innovation in UK banking.\nFor more information, please visit\nwww.fiinu.com\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

This reflects the increased costs associated with the development of the white-label solution and the preparatory work for the Everfex P.S.A. acquisition.\nDr Marko Sjoblom, Fiinu's Chief Executive\nsaid:\n\"The first half of 2025 has been a defining period for Fiinu, during which we made significant progress on our core strategic priorities. Most notably, we advanced the implementation of the white-label arrangement announced in January, expanding the reach of our Plugin Overdraft\u00ae product and successfully raised capital to support the product development . These initiatives underline our commitment to delivering scalable, technology-led financial solutions to the market.\n\"Despite the challenges of operating with limited capital and human resources, our leadership team-supported unwaveringly by the Board remained firmly focused on our long-term strategy. By prioritising disciplined allocation of resources and aligning every decision with our growth objectives, we continued to make tangible progress across key initiatives. This resilience demonstrates our determination to build a scalable and sustainable business for the future.\n\"Looking ahead, my overriding objective-aligned with my proposed long-term incentive arrangements-is to deliver a step-change in shareholder value by increasing our share price to 110 pence and market capitalisation to \u00a3440 million over the next 36 months. While ambitious, this target reflects my confidence in the strategic path we have set and our ability to execute the initiatives required to unlock meaningful value creation for our shareholders.\"\nKey\nFinancials\nHighlighted below are the key unaudited financial highlights for the six months to 30 June 2025, compared to the six months to 30 June 2024 and the audited year
