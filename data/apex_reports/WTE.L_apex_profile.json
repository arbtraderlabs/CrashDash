PL001 is located immediately to the west of PL032 containing the Navitas operated Sea Lion Project which recently achieved Final Investment Decision with respect to Phase 1 of this giant development complex with over 700 MMbbls of recoverable resources.\nPL001, which covers approximately 1,126 square kilometres, is located in modest water depths (<500m), is fully covered by 3D seismic and contains significant exploration potential. JHI's internal Best Estimates indicate a prospect inventory containing an aggregate 3.1bn bbls of prospective recoverable resources with an aggregate upside of more than 10 bn bbls\n2\n. So far, two oil prospects, Tyche and Dinlas, have been high-graded within the same stratigraphic interval as the Sea Lion accumulation - each containing a potential 400 MMbbls recoverable\n2\n.\nJHI is a private, Ontario-registered, company established in 2014 and focused on oil exploration opportunities in the emerging Guyana-Suriname and North Falklands basins.

Against a backdrop of geopolitical tensions, conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, international sanctions plus tariff and trade uncertainties, electricity demand growth from data centres and AI businesses - governments have been forced to focus on maintaining secure and affordable energy supplies, in some cases at the expense of net-zero aspirations. Global primary energy demand is estimated to have increased by 2% in 2024 - higher than the average increase for the past ten years\n1\n- underpinned by continued steady growth in oil and gas demand - notwithstanding the massive investment and rapid growth in renewable energies such as wind and solar during recent years.\nThe general consensus is that oil and natural gas resources will be needed for many decades to come with some forecasts indicating that oil and natural gas will make up more than half of the world's energy supply in 2050. Oil demand is anticipated to stabilize after 2030, remaining above 100 million barrels per day through 2050. However, demand for natural gas is forecast to rise by more than 20% - driven by higher electricity demand in developing countries2. Since the 2014 oil price crash upstream capital available for oil and gas investment has declined abruptly from USD$779 billion per annum, with investment in 2025 estimated to be around USD$570 billion3. Oil and gas production is a depletion business with nearly 90% of this annual investment in recent years dedicated to offsetting production declines rather than to meeting demand growth. This implies that modest drops in annual upstream investment can choke off supply growth. Furthermore, the IEA indicates that oil and gas field depletion may be progressing faster than previously believed which suggests that the industry will need to invest more on exploration just to sustain the current rate of production.\nWhile the longer-term outlook for the E&P sector continues to be positive the near-term picture with respect to supply/demand balance is uncertain - with Brent prices retreating in the last year from a peak above $80/bbl to below $65/bbl in early November 2025. A combination of non-OPEC+ supply growth and continued unwinding of OPEC+ voluntary cuts point to abundant supply. Simultaneously, with crude inventory building in China and opportunistic replenishment of the US SPR underway, economic uncertainty due to tariffs and realignment of trade relationships is likely to impact economic growth particularly in SE Asia\n4\nand hence near-term oil demand.\nNevertheless, exploration for conventional oil and gas resources is likely to remain a core focus for the energy industry through this rebalancing period. Disciplined capital allocation while building diversification and optionality into prospect portfolios is a strategy being deployed by the bigger companies in the hunt for advantaged barrels that can meet their stringent financial return thresholds and ESG investment metrics. Westmount's investees remain well positioned with a diversified portfolio of exploration assets in proven, prolific, hydrocarbon provinces (North Falkland, Guyana-Suriname and Orange Basins) which should continue to attract a disproportionate share of global exploration capital in the coming years.\nNorth Falkland Basin (Falkland Islands)\nAfter a long journey, the North Falkland Basin is on the verge of becoming a significant hydrocarbon producer with FID on Phase 1 of the 2010 Sea Lion Discovery expected in Q4 2025. A 'Development Pending' Gross 2C Resource of over 700 MMbbls indicates that Sea Lion is indeed a giant oil field. Located in water depths of circa 400 metres, with benign met-ocean conditions, and with the current phased development plan offering 'life of field' breakeven costs of $25/bbl, it points to robust economic rewards for stakeholders under a range of oil price scenarios. In addition, other significant discoveries within the basin - such as the Johnson (14/5-1) gas-condensate discovery made in 1998, to the north of the Sea Lion Complex, and the 2015-2016 Isobel-Elaine (14/20-1 and 14/20-2) oil discovery, to the south of Sea Lion, - suggest the North Falkland Basin is a prolific hydrocarbon province with the potential for the discovery of significant additional resources. The continued positive statements from Navitas with regards to the Sea Lion development and the recent equity fundraisings by both Navitas and Rockhopper indicate that the project is on track for FID prior to year end. Achievement of this milestone should unlock the North Falkland Basin and is likely to be a significant catalyst for further exploration in the area.\nInvestee Interests - offshore Falkland Islands\nProduction Licence PL001 (JHI Associates Inc. - 100%)\nOn 25 September 2023, Argos Resources Limited (\"Argos\") announced the completion of a transaction with JHI which resulted in the acquisition of operatorship and 100% working interest in North Falklands Basin Production Licence PL001 by JHI in return for a consideration of 8,467,820 JHI Common Shares (\"the Consideration Shares\") and \u00a3303,500 in cash. It was stated that these Consideration Shares would represent approximately 9.3 per cent of the enlarged share capital of JHI following completion of the transaction.\nIn November 2024 JHI and the Falkland Islands Government (\"FIG\") agreed upon a two-year extension to the second exploration period of the PL001 Production Licence, until 31 December 2026. At that time, JHI can apply to enter the third exploration period of ten years, running from 1 January 2027 to 31 January 2036 with a firm commitment to drill one exploration well. Fiscal terms are benign with 9% royalty and 26% corporation tax.\nPL001 is immediately adjacent to the west of Production Licence PL032 containing the Navitas Petroleum/Rockhopper Sea Lion development. PL001 is located in modest water depths (<500m) and is fully covered by 3D seismic. JHI's internal estimates indicate a prospect inventory defined on 3D seismic containing an aggregate 3.1bn bbls of prospective recoverable resources with an upside of more than 10 bn bbls\n5\n. So far, two oil prospects, Tyche and Dinlas, have been high-graded within the same stratigraphic interval as the Sea Lion discovery - each containing a potential 400 MMbbls recoverable\n5\n. Westmount's\nshareholding in JHI equates to an effective 6.24% economic interest in these prospects and the PL001 licence.\nGuyana-Suriname Basin (offshore Guyana)\nDuring 2025 Guyana reached the 10-year anniversary of the drilling of the Liza-1 well its first offshore oil discovery. In that time Guyana has been transformed from a frontier deepwater exploration opportunity into the industry's largest new oil province - with\ncirca\n11 billion barrels of oil equivalent discovered recoverable resource - and the world's fastest growing economy powered by a total of more than USD$60bn in funds committed to the seven approved offshore projects to date. Against a backdrop of some intermittent friction with respect to the border with Venezuela, Guyana has become a significant source of non-OPEC production growth and is about to become the largest oil producer per capita, globally, later this year. By the end of H1 2025 the three projects already on stream - Liza Phase 1, Liza Phase 2 and Payara - were producing roughly 650k BOPD in aggregate, significantly above the gross nameplate capacity of the three installed FPSOs. In August 2025 ExxonMobil announced the start-up of production at Yellowtail, the largest development to date with an initial annual average production of 250k BOPD - bringing total installed capacity offshore Guyana to over 900k BOPD. In addition, with the Uaru (250k BOPD, start-up 2026), Whiptail (250k BOPD, start-up late 2027) and the recently sanctioned Hammerhead (150k BOPD, start-up 2029) projects progressing through development, Guyana remains on track to have a total production capacity of 1.7 BOEPD from eight developments by 2030\n6\n.\nWhile drilling of development wells for sanctioned projects continues to dominate, a reduction in the drillship fleet from six to five ships for much of the period points to a reduced level of exploration and appraisal drilling activity throughout 2024 and into 2025. With drilling exclusively focused on the Stabroek Block, fewer exploration wells were reported during the period with Bluefin-1 (60m hydrocarbon bearing - the sole discovery during 2024), and Hamlet-1 (results not reported) both drilled in the southeast of the block. Some hub class prospects were also evaluated during this period, in a relatively undrilled area to the northwest of the initial Liza discovery, with the drilling of Trumpetfish-1 (unsuccessful) and Redmouth-1, Redmouth-1A (results not reported). In contrast, significant appraisal drilling/testing operations were reported during the period at Lau Lau-2, Barreleye-2, Lukanani-2, Haimara-3, -4 - with the latter wells targeting the more gas rich resources in the southeast of the block. In September 2025 it was reported that the Stabroek partners had returned to the 2018 Ranger Discovery in the northwest of the block with the spudding of a 2nd appraisal well, Ranger-3. The Ranger Discovery is located in >2,700m water depth and is located proximal to the 2020 Tanager-1 Discovery, which straddles the Stabroek/Kaieteur block boundary. Separately, in June 2024, it was reported that the government of Guyana had selected a U.S. startup, Fulcrum LNG, in partnership with ExxonMobil, to assist with monetization of gas resources which could be produced on a large scale, for export\n7\n.\nOn a smaller scale, Guyana's first Gas to Energy project is at an advanced stage. On 9 October 2024, it was reported that a pipeline connecting the Liza Phase 1 and Phase 2 FPSOs with onshore integrated gas processing facilities (currently under construction at Wales, West Bank Demerara) had been mechanically completed and pressure tested\n8\n. The pipeline has a capacity to transport circa 130 million cubic feet of gas per day (mmcf/d) but will initially deliver approximately 50 mmcf/d to feed the 300MW power plant and NGL facility. As of September 2025, construction of the power plant is reported to be 76% completed\n9\n. The project, which is expected to help lower electricity costs and reduce emissions, once completed in 2026, by reducing dependence on imported heavy fuel oil. The project will be the first to take advantage of associated gas currently produced with the oil on the Stabroek Block. Associated gas from the Hammerhead development is also expected to be transferred to Guyana's Gas-to-Energy (GtE) pipeline for delivery to shore. The Wales construction project is now also expected to include a natural gas liquids storage and marine offloading facility, with associated pipelines. The government has launched a two-part procurement process to find firms to construct and manage the NGL storage/offloading facility, which will receive liquids from the separation plant that is currently under construction. The facility is planned to handle liquids at a rate of about 4,200 barrels per day (b/d) initially, with room to scale up by an additional 5,900 b/d under a second phase\n10\n.\nIn July 2023 Hess reported that the Stabroek partners had secured a one-year extension to the Stabroek exploration licence, from October 2026 to October 2027, as a result of force majeure due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In July 2025, it was reported that the Stabroek partners had relinquished 2,534 square kilometres of the Stabroek block - circa 9% of the block's 26,800-square-kilometer area\n11\n.\nOn 23 October 2023 Chevron Corporation announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement with Hess Corporation to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Hess in an all-stock transaction valued at $53 billion, with a total enterprise value of the transaction, including debt, of $60 billion. The transaction was originally expected to close in H1 2024. However, on 6 March 2024, it was reported that ExxonMobil had filed for arbitration, with the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in Paris, to assert it's right of first refusal under the Stabroek JOA. The protracted arbitration proceedings were resolved on 18 July 2025, with the ICC finding in favour of Chevron thereby allowing them to immediately complete the acquisition of Hess Corporation.\nIn December 2022, the Guyanese government launched a Licensing Round for 14 offshore blocks (3 deepwater and 11 shallow water blocks) under revised fiscal and contractual terms including biddable signature bonus with a minimum threshold of USD $20M and $10M for deepwater and shallow water blocks, respectively. On 15 September 2023, it was announced that bids had been received for eight of the fourteen blocks on offer, with a total of 14 bids received from 6 groups, including the ExxonMobil/Hess/CNOOC and the TotalEnergies/QatarEnergy/Petronas groups. Contract negotiations are continuing but as of end September 2025 no new licences had been issued\n12\n. However, on 11 November 2025, TotalEnergies announced that it had signed a production sharing contract for shallow water Block S4 with an initial work program consisting 2,000 km2 3D seismic acquisition. TotalEnergies (40%) will operate the block, with QatarEnergy (35%) and Petronas (25%) as partners.\nIn the Surinamese sector exploration, appraisal and development activities have continued through this period. On 1 October 2024, Suriname's first offshore development was confirmed when the Block 58 operator, TotalEnergies, announced FID with respect to the 'GranMorgu' complex containing the Sapkara South and Krabdagu low-GOR oil discoveries, with First Oil scheduled for mid-2028. This development brings together a combined 750 million barrels of recoverable resources using an all-electric, 220,000 bopd FPSO, with 4-year plateau and full gas reinjection - meeting the operator's requirements in terms of unit cost (CAPEX + OPEX $19/boe) and emissions intensity (<16 Kg/boe CO2)\n13\n. The GranMorgu FPSO is designed to accommodate future tie-back opportunities that would extend its production plateau. One such tie-back opportunity is the nearby Baja-1 oil discovery on Block 53, operated by APA. In June 2025, TotalEnergies announced that it had acquired a 25% interest in Block 53 from Moeve (formerly CEPSA) with a view to using these additional resources to extend the production plateau at GranMorgu. Separately, Staatsolie announced in May 2025 that it had concluded a USD$1.6bn bank loan with a group of 18 banks and financial institutions to part fund its 20% participation in the GranMorgu project.\nElsewhere, offshore Suriname, Petronas has been progressing the potential for an integrated oil and gas development in the area of Block 52, notwithstanding ExxonMobil's exit from a 50% non-operating position in the block in November 2024. On 16 May 2024, Petronas announced a third discovery on Block 52, with Fusaea-1 encountering several oil and gas-bearing sandstone reservoirs in the Campanian interval. Subsequently, on 8 August 2024, a successful appraisal well at Sloanea-2 was reported, with Petronas flagging the potential for a standalone Floating Liquified Natural Gas (FLNG) project at the field. In May 2025 Staatsolie reported that TotalEnergies would be using the Stena DrillMAX to spud the Macaw-1 exploration well on Block 64 - the first of five exploration wells scheduled to be drilled offshore Suriname in 2025. Macaw-1 was due to spud around 19 May and scheduled to take 80 days to drill - no results have been reported to date. The other exploration wells scheduled for drilling or underway in 2025 include Caiman-1 and Kiskadee-1 (Petronas, Block 52 - as part of a three well program which commenced in July, using the Noble Developer semi-submersible), Korikori-1 (Chevron, Block 5 - expected to spud before end October, using the Noble Regina Allen jack-up) and Araku Deep-1 (Shell, Block 65 - pending the return of the Stena DrillMAX drillship to offshore Suriname).\nOn 13 September 2024, Staatsolie announced the signature of two new PSCs (Blocks 14 & 15) with Petrochina, a subsidiary of CNPC. In June 2025 Petronas reported that it had signed a PSC for Block 66 which includes a firm commitment to drill two exploration wells, targeting drill-ready prospects that offer significant resource potential and synergies with their existing operations in Block 52. In August 2025 Staatsolie announced that it will launch an 'Open-Door Offering' in November 2025, for open acreage offshore Suriname. On 5 November 2025 Staatsolie also reported that it had signed new PSCs for Blocks 9 & 10 - with participants in Block 9 to be Petronas (30%, operator), Chevron (20%), QatarEnergy (20%), Paradise Oil Co./POC (30%) - and participants in Block 10 to be Chevron (30%, operator), Petronas (30%), QatarEnergy (30%) and POC (10%).\nIn summary, the Guyana-Suriname basin remains a prolific hydrocarbon province with potential for significant undiscovered resources in multiple plays. However, 'shifting sands' have seen a more dynamic exploration sector emerge in the Suriname sector with five exploration wells scheduled for drilling or underway in 2025 vs one exploration well in the Guyanese sector (none outside of the Stabroek Block). Macro factors such as operator dominance and priorities, prolonged arbitration proceedings and the electoral cycle together with differing prospect economic thresholds have contributed to this asymmetry. Substantial drill-ready prospects have been high-graded on the Kaieteur, Canje and Orinduik blocks and remain to be evaluated by the drill-bit. However, a number of challenges with respect to JV alignment/composition, licence extensions, environmental permitting and financing will need to be overcome to progress to the drilling phase.\nInvestee Interests - offshore Guyana\nKaieteur Block (Cataleya Energy Corp. - 50%; Ratio Petroleum - 50%)\nThe southern portion of the Kaieteur Block is covered by a 5,750km2 3D seismic survey, which was acquired in 2017/18 and has provided the foundation for maturing a significant prospect inventory on the block. A single prospect has been drilled to date which resulted in a sub-commercial oil discovery. The ExxonMobil operated Tanager-1 well, which was drilled in H2 2020, encountered 16 metres of net oil pay (20oAPI oil) in high-quality sandstone reservoirs of Maastrichtian age with a volumetric 'Best Estimate' Unrisked Gross (2C) Contingent Oil Resource of 65.3 MMBBLs (Low to High Estimates 17.7 MMBBLs to 131 MMBBLs) - Netherland, Sewell & Associates Inc. (\"NSAI\") published CPR (February 14, 2021). However, this discovery is currently considered to be non-commercial as a standalone development.\nSubsequent to the Tanager-1 discovery, on May 24, 2021, it was announced that Hess Corporation (\"Hess\") had increased its working interest (\"WI\") in the Kaieteur Block, offshore Guyana, from 15% to 20% via the farm-down of a 5% WI by Cataleya Energy Limited (\"CEL\"). However, in spite of a number of subsequent postponements, the operator ExxonMobil decided not to exercise its option to drill a second well on the block.\nOn 27 September 2023, it was announced by Ratio Petroleum Energy Limited Partnership (\"Ratio Petroleum\"), that both ExxonMobil and Hess had elected to withdraw from the Kaieteur Block and return their participating interests to the original Kaieteur Licence holders, Ratio Guyana Limited (\"RGL\") and Cataleya Energy Limited (\"CEL\"). The process of reassigning the participating interests is ongoing, with RGL and CEL each retaining a 50% participating interest, and RGL operating the block. It was also announced that under the terms of the Kaieteur Petroleum Agreement, upon submission of an application to enter the second extension period, and upon the granting of a one year 'Covid extension' the participating interests on the block will have until February 2026 to commit to drilling a well. In this context, it is noted, that Ratio Petroleum is actively seeking a farm-down of participating interests with a view to bringing a new deepwater operator to the block.\nIn parallel, on 29 September 2024, Ratio Petroleum announced that it had received a buy-out offer form Ratio Energy Partnership Ltd. (already a significant shareholder in Ratio Petroleum) at 0.35NIS per share unit, subject to shareholder approval. Ratio Energy Partnership Ltd. is a well-capitalised TASE listed company, with a 15% interest in the giant, producing, Leviathan Gas Field, offshore Israel and a current market capitalisation in excess of USD $800M. Subsequently, on 12 January 2025, Ratio Petroleum indicated that, in lieu of the buy-out offer, it was considering a merger proposal from Ratio Energy and on 11 August 2025 Ratio Petroleum announced the temporary suspension of this merger review until the end of the year.\nAs of 30 June 2025, the Kaieteur Block is\nde facto\noperated by RGL (50% and operator) with CEL (50%) as partner. As of 30 June 2025, Westmount retains a holding of approximately 4.1% of the issued share capital of Cataleya Energy Corporation (\"CEC\") the parent company of CEL and circa 0.04% of the issued share capital of Ratio Petroleum Energy Limited Partnership (\"Ratio Petroleum\") the ultimate holding entity with respect to RGL.\nCanje Block (JHI Associates Inc. - 17.5%)\nIn 2016, ExxonMobil, as operator, acquired in excess of 6,100 km2 of 3D seismic covering the entire Canje Block. Subsequent processing and interpretation of this dataset was used to define a substantial prospect inventory on the block with three prospects (Bulletwood-1, Jabillo-1, and Sapote-1) high-graded for drilling in the initial drilling campaign in 2021. All three wells were targeting Late Cretaceous basin floor fans and channel complexes. Although the drilling confirmed the presence of the Guyana-Suriname petroleum system, including the presence of some quality reservoirs at all 3 locations, no commercial hydrocarbons were encountered.\nSubsequent to the completion of this first phase of drilling on block the focus of the Canje JV partners has been on the analysis and assimilation of the 2021 drilling results and data gathering program, the reprocessing and re-interpretation of the 3D seismic data, and the high-grading of the Cretaceous prospect inventory including the prospects in the deeper emerging Santonian-Cenomanian plays.\nOn 11 September 2023, the operator filed a Cumulative Impact Assessment (\"CIA\") for the Canje Block with the EPA. This CIA report indicated that exploration drilling on the Canje Block could potentially recommence from 2024, though this guideline has not been met. In December 2024 JHI and the Canje JV partners signed a one-year extension to the Canje Petroleum Agreement, extending the exploration period by one year, ending on 4 March 2026. In addition, as required under the Petroleum Agreement, 20% of the original Canje area was relinquished reducing the block area to 3,534 square kilometres.\nWestmount holds an indirect interest in the Canje Block as a result of its circa 6.2% interest (see Table 1) in the issued share capital of JHI Associates Inc. (\"JHI\"), as of 30 June 2025. The company also holds an additional indirect interest in the Canje Block as a result of its shareholding in Eco (Atlantic) Oil and Gas Ltd. (\"EOG\") and following the investments in JHI Associates Inc. (\"JHI\") announced by EOG on 28 June 2021 and 19 January 2022.\nThe most recent published financial information with respect to JHI indicated it had circa USD$19.7 M in cash and cash equivalents as of 31 December 2021\n14\n.\nThe Canje Block is currently operated by an ExxonMobil subsidiary, Esso Exploration & Production Guyana Limited (35%), with TotalEnergies E&P Guyana B.V. (35%), JHI Associates (BVI) Inc. (17.5%) and Mid-Atlantic Oil & Gas Inc. (12.5%) as partners.\nOrinduik Block (Eco Atlantic Oil and Gas Ltd. - 100%)\nIn 2017 Tullow Oil, the then operator of the Orinduik Block, acquired 2,500 km2 of 3D seismic data covering the entire block. In 2019 the initial drilling campaign on the block focused on the shallower Tertiary reservoirs and resulted in two heavy oil discoveries, Jethro and Joe which are currently considered to be non-commercial. As of 31 December 2022, the gross 2C resource attributable to Tullow's then 60% operated interest amounted to 47.7MMBBLs. Throughout 2022 and 2023 the focus of the Orinduik Block JV partners continued to be on the analysis and assimilation of the 2019/20 drilling results and data gathering program, the reprocessing and re-interpretation of the 3D seismic data, and the high-grading of the deeper Cretaceous light oil prospect inventory with a view to target selection for the next drilling campaign on the block. An EOG commissioned CPR by WSP, dated 20 March, 2022, indicates an aggregate Unrisked Prospective Resource (Best Estimate) of 3,386MMBBLs in 11 Cretaceous prospects. Nevertheless, progress towards drilling on the block during this period remained stymied due to the diverging strategies of the JV partners.\nOn 10 August 2023, EOG announced that it had signed a Sale Purchase Agreement (\"SPA\") pursuant to which its wholly owned subsidiary, Eco Guyana Oil and Gas (Barbados) Limited (\"Eco Guyana\"), would acquire a 60% Operated Interest in the Orinduik Block, offshore Guyana, through the acquisition of Tullow Guyana B.V. (\"TGBV\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Tullow Oil Plc. (\"Tullow\") in exchange for an initial payment of USD$700,000 cash and a series of contingent payments based upon a commercial discovery outcome and subsequent success case development milestones.\nFollowing completion of this transaction, on 21 November 2023, EOG became operator of the block with an aggregate 75% WI held via its wholly owned subsidiaries Eco Orinduik B.V. (60%) and Eco (Atlantic) Guyana Inc (15%). Subsequently, at year end, TOQAP Guyana B.V relinquished its 25% WI and EOG became the sole interest holder in the Orinduik Block with 100% WI.\nOn January 22, 2024, EOG gave notice to the Minister of Natural Resources of the Cooperative Republic of Guyana to enter the Second Phase of the Second Renewable Period of the Orinduik License which under the Petroleum Agreement contains a commitment to drill a well to the Cretaceous by January 2026.\nSubsequent to assuming operatorship of Orinduik EOG has revitalised farm-down efforts with a view to attracting partners to drill a stacked-pay target in the more prolific Cretaceous light oil play, which remains unexplored on the Orinduik Block. In June 2025 EOG reported that it remains engaged in an active farmout process for the Orinduik Block while also evaluating the Jethro and Joe heavy oil discoveries to determine the appropriate appraisal approach. These endeavours may have been potentially bolstered by the September 2025 announcement by Stabroek operator, ExxonMobil, that the neighbouring Hammerhead Discovery had achieved FID with first oil projected to be in 2028. Hammerhead, which contains heavier 20-25oAPI crude oil, was discovered in 2018 with the final appraisal well, Hammerhead-4, drilled proximal to the Orinduik block boundary, in September 2023.\nEOG reported its cash and cash equivalents to be USD$3.6M at 30 June 2025 and is also due to receive circa USD$11.5M as a result of milestone payments due under various Block 3B/4B (South Africa) farm-down transactions.\nOrange Basin (offshore Namibia and South Africa)\nThree years post the initial play opening discoveries at Graff-1x (Shell) and Venus-1x (TotalEnergies) exploration and appraisal activity has continued to be focused in the Namibian sector of the Orange Basin. With the completed drill count since early 2022 now at eighteen exploration wells and six appraisal wells this campaign has yielded twelve discoveries and a NAMCOR estimate of +21 Bn boe in-place resources discovered to date\n15\n. In addition, two of these discoveries - the TotalEnergies operated Venus Discovery on Block 2913B (PEL56) and the Galp operated Mopane complex on Block 2813B (PEL83) - are progressing towards FPSO development, in the context of discussions with the government re licence conditions and gas disposal challenges and in the case of Mopane, farm-down discussions attempting to attract a new development partner. In contrast, new Orange Basin drilling activity has yet to occur on the South African side as operators including Shell and TotalEnergies grapple with environmental permitting and associated legal challenges - notwithstanding the presence of a substantial drill-ready prospect inventory including Volstruis (Deep Water Orange Basin Block) and Nyala (Block 3B/4B).\nDuring the period two unsuccessful exploration wells were completed, back-to-back, by the operator TotalEnergies on Block 2913B using the DeepSea Mira semi-submersible rig. Tamboti-1x which was spudded on 20 October 2024, encountered 85m of net reservoir in lower quality Upper Cretaceous sandstones containing black oil which was drill-stem tested. On 28 April 2025, it was reported that the Marula-1x had been drilled to TD without encountering hydrocarbons in the primary Albian reservoir target. With respect to Block 2813B, after reporting initial discovery (Mopane-1x, tested at 14kBOEPD) and successful appraisal (Mopane-2x) in H1 2024 Galp Energia proceeded to drill two further appraisal wells on the Mopane complex, using the Santorini Drillship, in Q4 2024. Mopane-1A confirmed the extension to the south of the main AVO-1 reservoir, while Mopane-2A confirmed an extension of the AVO-3 reservoir and discovered AVO-4, a new light-oil bearing reservoir. No hydrocarbon-water contacts were found in any of these reservoirs and initial analysis indicated good porosities and permeabilities, high pressures and low fluid viscosity characteristics, with minimum CO2 and no H2S concentrations. The drillship then moved to Mopane-3x an 18km step-out to the southeast from the Mopane-1x discovery well. On 25 February 2025 it was confirmed that the well had been successfully drilled, cored and logged, encountering stacked high-quality sandstone reservoirs with significant columns of light oil and gas-condensate across the AVO-10 reservoir plus the presence of light oil columns in the AVO-13 reservoir and a deeper sand.\nOn 16 December 2024, it was announced that Qatar Energy had farmed into Block 2813B (PEL90) prior to the spudding of the first well on the block. On 15 January 2025, it was reported that Chevron had drilled a dry hole, at Kapana-1x, in the southeast corner of the block using the DeepSea Bollsta semi-submersible rig. On 17 March 2025, Pancontinental reported that it had received notification from Woodside Energy that Woodside had elected not to exercise its option to farm-in to Blocks 2713A & 2713B (PEL 87). Subsequent to the Azule Energy farm-in to Block 2914A (PEL85) in May 2024, Rhino Resources spudded its first well on this block, Sagittarius-1x, in December 2024 using the Noble Venturer drillship - reaching TD on 6 February 2025. It was reported that the well encountered a hydrocarbon bearing reservoir in the Upper Cretaceous, with no observed water contact, and with fluid and reservoir properties to be confirmed by laboratory analysis. The drillship then moved to spud Capricornus-1x reaching TD on 2 April 2025. This well encountered 38m of net pay in a high quality, light oil bearing, Lower Cretaceous reservoir target with no observed hydrocarbon-water contact. A subsequent production test achieved a surface-constrained flow rate in excess of 11,000 stb/d on a 40/64\" choke, recovering light ~37\u00b0 API oil with limited associated gas, less than 2% CO2 and no hydrogen sulphide. On 31 July 2025, Rhino Resources announced the spudding of a third well, Volans-1x, using the Deepsea Mira rig. This well, which reached TD on 30 August 2025, encountered 26m of net pay in a rich gas-condensate bearing, Upper Cretaceous, reservoir with no observed hydrocarbon-water contact. The reservoir has excellent quality petrophysical properties and two fluid samples taken from the top and the base of the reservoir indicate the presence of a high liquid-yield gas condensate (CGR >140 bbl/mmscf) and a liquid density of around 40\u00b0 API gravity. Subsequently, Rhino Resources reported that the company is planning to develop a fast-track production hub centred on these discoveries - targeting FID in late 2026/early 2027 and first oil in 2030. On 18 September 2025 it was announced that the Deepsea Mira rig had moved to spud the Kharas-1x well for BW Energy in the northwest of the Kudu license. On 31 October 2025 BW Energy reported that the well had reached total depth with several intervals showing indications of hydrocarbon presence and reservoir potential and with the K1 interval indicating the presence of wet gas. Subsequent wireline operations would assess reservoir quality, fluid type, and pressure characteristics and guide decisions with respect to future appraisal strategy.\nAll the evidence suggests that the prolific Orange Basin petroleum system, with multiple plays and deepwater reservoir targets, extends from the Namibian sector south into the South African sector. In addition, a substantial prospect inventory has already been defined on 3D seismic in the South African sector suggesting that the Orange Basin is still in the early part of the creaming curve with the potential for the discovery of additional large-scale resources.\nInvestee Interests - offshore South Africa\nBlock 3B/4B (Eco Atlantic Oil and Gas Ltd. - 5.25% 'fully carried')\nWestmount previously held indirect interests in Block 3B/4B via its shareholdings in Africa Oil Corp (\"AOC\")/subsequently Meren Energy Inc. (\"MER\") and EOG. Following the disposal of its holdings in MER reported on 10 June 2025, Westmount's remaining interest in Block 3B/4B is held via its stake in EOG.\nPrior work undertaken on Block 3B/4B, including the reprocessing of 2,200 km2 of 3D seismic and an independent review of Block 3B/4B prospective resources, undertaken by RISC Advisory (UK) Limited (\"RISC\"). The RISC analysis of the licence identified a total Unrisked Gross P50 Prospective Resource of approximately 4 billion barrels of oil equivalent (\"BOE\") in 24 prospects, with individual prospect probabilities of success ranging from 11% to 39%.\nSubsequent to a Letter of Intent announced by EOG on 11 July 2023 and the entry into an Assignment and Transfer Agreement on 14 July 2023, EOG agreed to farm out a 6.25% Participating Interest in Block 3B/4B, offshore South Africa to AOC for up to US$10.5 million in cash, payable via a series of contingent milestone payments. Upon completion of this transaction, on 22 January 2024, the Block 3B/4B Licence holders were as follows: Africa Oil SA Corp a wholly owned subsidiary of AOC (26.25%, operator), Azinam Limited a wholly owned subsidiary of EOG (20%) and Ricocure (Proprietary) Limited (53.75%).\nOn 6 March 2024, EOG announced a further farm-down of a 13.75% participating interest in Block 3B/4B [as part of an aggregate 57% farm down transaction along with its JV Partners Africa Oil SA Corp. (\"AOC\") and Ricocure (Proprietary) Limited (\"Ricocure\")] to TotalEnergies EP South Africa B.V., who will become Operator (\"TotalEnergies\") and QatarEnergy International E&P LLC (\"QatarEnergy\"). EOG reported the value of this transaction to EOG as up to USD$32.1M - including 'loan carry' of EOG's residual 6.25% interest on up to two wells, contingent cash milestone payments from farminees and payments due to EOG from AOC and Ricocure under prior agreements. Completion of this transaction was reported on 28 August 2024 with the revised JV interests as follows: TotalEnergies (operator) 33%, QatarEnergy 24%, AOC 17%, EOG 6.25% and Ricocure 19.75%.\nSeparately, on 29 July 2024, EOG announced that it had entered an Assignment and Share Cancellation Agreement with AOC whereby EOG would sell a 1% interest in Block 3B/4B to AOC in exchange for cancellation of all of AOC's shares and warrants in EOG (worth C$ 11.5m). AOC currently holds, in aggregate, 54,941,744 Common Shares and 4,864,865 Warrants in EOG which, assuming conversion of the Warrants, would equal 16.16% on a diluted basis (c.15% non-diluted) of the total outstanding common shares of EOG. On 13 January 2025 EOG announced the completion of this transaction with EOG having a circa 15% reduction in its issued share capital, while retaining a 5.25% 'carried' interest in Block 3B/4B.\nEOG had previously reported the submission, in March 2023, of an Environmental Authorisation application for drilling of up to 2 wells on prospects defined on 3D seismic in a high-graded area in the north of Block 3B/4B. The EIA was reported to be approved by the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy in early October 2024\n16\n.\nBlock 1 (Eco Atlantic Oil and Gas Ltd. - 75% and operator)\nBlock 1 is located immediately south of the Namibia-South African maritime boundary and extends, from shoreline out to 1,000 metre water depth, covering an\u00a0area of 19,929km\u00b2. Subsequent to a farm-in agreement with Tosaco Energy (Proprietary) Ltd., announced on 5 June 2024, EOG reported on 4 June 2025 that it had secured the transfer of a 75% Working Interest and operatorship with respect to Block 1. The consideration for this transaction was a series of staged cash payments totalling USD$750k and a carry of the remaining 25% Interest through the Budget and Work Program for the first three years up to an agreed sum of USD$2.3 million of a total work program.\nEOG has already purchased and is analysing the existing, high-quality legacy dataset, including extensive 2D seismic datasets, 3,500 km2 of 3D seismic and well data with respect to the three exploration wells previously drilled on the block. These wells include the Soekor AF-1 gas discovery, which tested gas at 32.4 MMscfd, and Soekor AE-1, which encountered oil and gas shows - providing clear evidence of an active petroleum system in the area. The block is adjacent to a number of recent discoveries in the Namibian sector of the Orange Basin - such as the Graff, La Rona, Lesedi, Enigma and Jonker discoveries made by Shell and the Capricornus-1x light oil discovery made by Rhino Resources.\nEOG anticipates launching a formal farm-out process in respect of its interest in Block 1 in August 2025.\nInvestment portfolio summary\nAs of 30 June 2025, Westmount had a cash balance of \u00a30.281M, listed marketable securities of \u00a30.153M, and is debt free.\nOn 10 June 2025 Westmount reported that it has received proceeds of circa \u00a3286,155, net of all costs, from the sale of 300,000 common shares in Meren Energy Inc. (formerly Africa Oil Corp.; \"MER\"; TSX: MER.TO, Nasdaq Stockholm: MER.ST), representing all of Westmount's holding in MER. The purchase cost of these shares, in June 2023, was \u00a3538,633 which indicates a net loss of \u00a3224,221 had been incurred after exchange rate movements and attributable dividends of circa \u00a328,255 during the ownership period.\nOn 30 June 2025, Westmount held a total of 5,651,270 shares in JHI, representing approximately 7.2% of the issued common shares in JHI as of 31 December 2022. Following the completion of the Argos-JHI transaction announced on 25 September 2023, the completion of the members voluntary liquidation by Argos and the pro rata distribution of JHI Consideration Shares to Argos shareholders, subsequent to period end Westmount received 33,987 JHI Consideration Shares in lieu of its one million shares in Argos. Westmount currently holds 5,685,257 shares in JHI, representing approximately 6.24% of the enlarged issued share capital of JHI.\nAs of 30 June 2025, Westmount retains 474,816 common shares in Cataleya Energy Corporation (\"CEC\") representing approximately 4.13% of the issued shares in CEC.\nWestmount continues to hold 1,500,000 shares in EOG, as of 30 June 2025. Further to the completion of the EOG-AOC transaction announced on 29 July 2024, whereby EOG sold a 1% interest in Block 3B/4B South Africa in exchange for cancellation of all of Africa Oil's shares and warrants in EOG, Westmount's 1,500,000 shares represent approximately 0.47% of EOG's common shares estimated to be in issue at completion.\nWestmount continues to hold 89,653 shares in Ratio Petroleum representing approximately 0.04% of the issued share capital. On 29 September 2024, it was reported by Ratio Petroleum that they had received a buy-out offer from Ratio Energy Partnership Limited of 0.35NIS per share unit (at prevailing exchange rates the aggregate value to Westmount was circa USD$8,475), subject to shareholder approval. Subsequently, on 12 January 2025, Ratio Petroleum indicated that, in lieu of the buy-out offer, it was considering a merger proposal from Ratio Energy and on 11 August 2025 Ratio Petroleum announced the temporary suspension of this merger review until the end of the year.\nThe complete investment portfolio is summarised in Table 1. The reported financial loss for the period is primarily made up of a non-cash loss on financial assets held at fair value through the profit and loss, some of which is as a result of Foreign Exchange movements on the portfolio Investments when valued at the period end.\nSummary/Outlook\nThe last twelve months have been a challenging period for Westmount - against a backdrop of limited visibility to Guyanese drilling activity within our investee portfolio, diminishing resources, combined with a large seller and exiting shareholder - resulting in the company being valued as an investment shell by the London AIM market for much of this time with little or no value being attributed to the company's private holdings in JHI and CEC.\nNevertheless, the Guyana-Suriname basin remains a prolific hydrocarbon province with potential for significant undiscovered resources in multiple plays. However, in spite of less benign fiscal terms than those available to Guyanese incumbents, the Suriname sector has delivered a more dynamic exploration program this year with five exploration wells (from four different operators) scheduled for drilling or underway in 2025 vs only one exploration well in the Guyanese sector (none outside of the Stabroek Block). Macro factors such as operator dominance and priorities, prolonged ExxonMobil/Hess-Chevron arbitration proceedings and the Guyanese electoral cycle, together with differing prospect economic thresholds, have all contributed to this asymmetry.\nWhile the arbitration proceedings were resolved in July 2025 and the sitting government was re-elected in September 2025 - substantial drill-ready prospects, which have been high-graded on the Kaieteur, Canje and Orinduik blocks for some time, remain to be evaluated by the drill-bit. Furthermore, a number of challenges with respect to JV alignment/composition, environmental permitting and financing all need to be overcome to progress to the drilling phase. In particular, it is likely that all three JVs are now going to require licence extensions to be negotiated from Q1 2026 for drilling activity to be delivered on these blocks.\nIn contrast, the Falkland Islands and the anticipated FID with respect to the Sea Lion development has generated much excitement in recent months. This FID is being viewed as unlocking the North Falklands Basin and providing a catalyst for further exploration in this prolific basin. Falkland Islands explorers have been substantially re-rated over the past twelve months and, serendipitously, Westmount with an effective economic interest of 6.24% in Production Licence PL001 now joins a peer group, with two other London AIM listed players, that offer investors exposure to the emerging Falkland Islands story. The continued positive statements from Navitas with regards to the Sea Lion development and the recent equity fundraisings by both Navitas and Rockhopper indicate that the project is on track for FID prior to year end.\nProduction Licence PL001 is immediately adjacent to the west of Production Licence PL032 containing the Navitas Petroleum/Rockhopper Sea Lion development. PL001 is located in modest water depths (<500m) and is fully covered by 3D seismic. JHI's internal estimates indicate a prospect inventory defined on 3D seismic containing an aggregate 3.1bn bbls of prospective recoverable resources with an upside of more than 10 bn bbls\n5\n. So far, two oil prospects, Tyche and Dinlas, have been high-graded within the same stratigraphic interval as the Sea Lion discovery - each containing a potential 400 MMbbls recoverable\n5\n.\nWestmount has no debt and sufficient cash resources to fund the minimum (irreducible) corporate overhead into H2 2026, with liquid investments available, if necessary, to increase this runway. Westmount is also looking at ways which would allow shareholders to more efficiently retain shareholdings in the company's private holdings.\nIn the interim, the board of Westmount continues to actively explore project and consolidation opportunities, both within and without the sector, to deliver improved shareholder value.\nGERARD WALSH\nChairman\n18 November 2025\nNotes\n1\nBP Energy Outlook 2025 Edition\nhttps://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/energy-economics/energy-outlook/bp-energy-outlook-2025.pdf\n2\n2025 ExxonMobil Global Outlook Executive Summary\nhttps://corporate.exxonmobil.com/-/media/global/files/global-outlook/2025-executive-summary.pdf\n3\nIEA Report - The Implications of Oil and Gas Field Decline Rates - 16 September 2025\nhttps://www.iea.org/reports/the-implications-of-oil-and-gas-field-decline-rates\n4\nTotalEnergies 2025 Strategy and Outlook - 29 September 2025\nhttps://totalenergies.com/sites/g/files/nytnzq121/files/documents/totalenergies_strategy-and-outlook-presentation_2025.pdf\n5\nJHI Associates Inc. website -\nhttps://www.jhiassociates.com/north-falkland-basin\n6\nExxonMobil Press Releases 8 August & 22 September 2025.\nhttps://investor.exxonmobil.com/company-information/press-releases/detail/1194/exxonmobil-guyana-expands-capacity-with-seventh-offshore\n7\nOilnow - Guyana taps Fulcrum LNG to partner with Exxon, government on gas development- June 21,2024\n8\nOilnow - Gas-to-Energy pipeline mechanically completed, ready to introduce natural gas - October 10, 2024\n9\nOilnow - Wales Gas-to-Energy project accelerates with 120-day foundation plan - September 16, 2025\n10\nOilnow - Guyana seeks legal and project management experts to steer Gas-to-Energy project - September 18, 2025\n11\nOilnow - Exxon gives back portion of Stabroek Block to Guyana government - July 3, 2025\n12\nOilnow - Four out of six bidders accept new Guyana PSA terms - Ministry - 17 October, 2024\n13\nhttps://totalenergies.com/news/press-releases/suriname-totalenergies-announces-final-investment-decision-granmorgu\n14\nEco Atlantic Press Release -14 March 2022.\n15\nSintana Energy Inc. - Corporate Presentation - October 2024\n16\nAfrica Oil and Gas, Vol.27, Issue20 - 10 October 2024\nFor further information, please contact:\nWestmount Energy Limited\nwww.westmountenergy.com\nDavid King, Director\nTel: +44 (0) 1534 823000\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\n(Nomad and Broker)\nTel: +44 (0) 20 7397 8900\nNeil McDonald / Pete Lynch\nDIRECTORS' REPORT\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2025\nThe Directors present their annual report and the audited financial statements of Westmount Energy Limited (the \"Company\") for the year ended 30 June 2025.\nPRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\nThe principal activity of the Company is, and continues to be, an energy investment company. Development of the Company's activities and its prospects are reviewed in the Chairman's Review on pages 3 to 13.\nThe Company was incorporated in Jersey on 1 October 1992 under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended, and is a public company with registered number 53623. The Company is listed on the London Stock Exchange Alternative Investment Market (\"AIM\") and was formerly available for cross-trading on the OTCQB Market in New York, U.S. under the ticker symbol \"WMELF\".

Under that law the Directors have elected to prepare the financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union ('IFRS Accounting Standards') and applicable law. Under Company law the Directors must prepare financial statements that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:\n\u00b7\nselect suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;\n\u00b7\nmake judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;\n\u00b7\nstate whether the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as adopted by the European Union; and\n\u00b7\nprepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business.\nThe Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\nAs far as the Directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company's auditor is unaware and each Director has taken all the steps that he ought to have undertaken as a director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company's auditor is aware of that information.\nThe Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company's website. The Company's website is maintained in compliance with AIM Rule 26.\nLegislation in Jersey governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\nThe Directors confirm that they have complied with all of the above requirements in preparing these financial statements.\nOn behalf of the Board\nD R KING\nDirector\n18 November 2025\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nThe Board have adopted the Quoted Companies Alliance Corporate Governance Code (\"the QCA Code\") following the London Stock Exchange's requirement for AIM listed companies to adopt and comply with a recognised corporate governance code.\nStrategy and Business Model\nThe strategy of the Company is to invest in and provide follow on capital to small and medium sized companies which have significant growth possibilities operating in the oil and gas sector. Members of the Board have specialist knowledge and experience in the upstream sector of the oil and gas industry (gained from extensive investing activity over a number of decades) allowing them to identify projects and growth companies with potentially higher returns, commensurate with acceptable levels of risk. The Company undertakes extensive due diligence on potential investment opportunities and monitors performance of its investments via close contact with the companies concerned and analysis of their public announcements and presentations. In common with other investment companies in this sector, access as a minority shareholder to projects and valuable investments is challenging but the Board is confident of its ability to continue to source attractive investment opportunities given close relationships with a number of companies and their management teams, and recognition of the Board's experience and strong network.\nShareholder Relations\nThe Company engages closely with its principal shareholders, a number of whom are Directors of the Company, primarily via face-to-face meetings and publishes announcements of significant activity consistent with market requirements. Shareholders receive annual and half-year financial statements and are invited to the Company's Annual General Meeting. Contact details for the Company are maintained on the website and on Regulatory News Service announcements. The Board seeks to build strong relationships with its institutional shareholders which are managed by the Chairman and supported by other members of the Board.\nGerard Walsh, Chairman, and Dermot Corcoran, Director, are primarily responsible for shareholder liaison, and can be contacted via the Contact Page on the Company's website.\nStakeholder and Social Responsibilities\nThe Board has identified its key stakeholders as being its shareholders and investee companies, given it has no employees and a small range of contracted service providers. It maintains contact with shareholders, of whom a significant proportion are Directors, via Regulatory News Service and periodic feedback from these parties. Contact with investee companies is operated via the Chairman and individual Board directors responsible for the relevant investment recommendation, and is geared to key operational, project and transactional cycles identified for the company concerned.\nRisk Management\nThe Company actively monitors and manages risk in its activities, principally through oversight and operation of its investment portfolio. The Company identifies key risks in all of its investments during the selection and due diligence cycle, and subsequent recommendations for investment by the Company consider for each proposal a range of risks and mitigating factors. Identification of these risks is achieved by direct engagement with the companies in which Westmount seeks to invest, close analysis of their market opportunities and threats, combined with detailed knowledge of the market sector where they operate and their competitors.\nBoard Composition, Evaluation and Decision Making\nThe Board comprises three shareholder Directors (including the Chairman Gerard Walsh) and one Non-Executive Director (David King) resident in Jersey, who is considered to be independent.\nThe Company deviates from the requirements of the QCA Code in that it has only one independent non-executive director. The Directors consider that the structure of the Board is appropriate and proportionate for the business at this stage of the Company's growth, and that the Independent Director, in conjunction with the Company's Nominated Adviser, provides appropriate challenge to the executive directors on all corporate governance matters. The Board intends to keep all aspects of its corporate governance - independence and the balance of executive and non-executive roles in particular - under review going forward.\nEach of the four directors has considerable experience in their respective fields and act collectively in all decision making of the Company. The Board is satisfied that it has a suitable balance between independence on the one hand and knowledge of the Company's activities, to allow it to properly discharge its responsibilities and duties. Directors are expected to use their judgement and experience to challenge and assess the appropriateness of operations and decision making at all times.\nThe Board has formally met two times this financial year and Directors each dedicate between 12 and 150 days' time to the Company per annum, including informal contact with other Board members and advisors, and attendance at the Annual General Meeting.\nThe Board regularly takes advice from its Nominated Advisor, Cavendish Securities plc, and other external advisors (principally its external lawyers) in relation to periodic investment opportunities and fund raising.\nThe Board completes an annual self-evaluation of its performance based on externally determined guidelines appropriate to the composition of the Board and the Company's operation, including Board Sub Committees. The scope of the self-evaluation exercise will be re-assessed each year to ensure appropriate depth and coverage of the Board's activities consistent with corporate best practice. The Board has adopted a board effectiveness questionnaire, which assesses the composition, processes, behaviours and activities of the board through a range of criteria, including board size and independence, mix of skills and experience, and general corporate governance considerations in line with the QCA code.\nGiven the stage of the business' maturity, the responsibilities of a nomination committee are delegated to the Board, and there are no formal succession planning processes in place. The Board intends to keep this under review as the business develops.\nCorporate Culture\nWestmount Energy supports the growing awareness of social, environmental and ethical matters when considering business practices. These statements provide an outline of the policies in place that guide the Company and its employees when dealing with social, environmental and ethical matters in the workplace.\nCode of Conduct\nWestmount Energy maintains and requires the highest ethical standards in carrying out its business activities in regards to dealing with gifts, hospitality, corruption, fraud, the use of inside information and whistleblowing.\nWestmount Energy maintains a zero-tolerance policy towards bribery and corruption.\nEqual Opportunity and Diversity\nWestmount Energy promotes and supports the rights and opportunities of all people to seek, obtain and hold employment without discrimination.\nIt is our policy to make every effort to provide a working environment free from bullying, harassment, intimidation and discrimination on the basis of disability, nationality, race, sex, sexual orientation, religion or belief.\nJoint Venture Partners, Contractors and Suppliers\nWestmount Energy is committed to being honest and fair in all its dealings with partners, contractors and suppliers.\nProcedures are in place to ensure that any form of bribery or improper behaviour is prevented from being conducted on Westmount Energy's behalf by joint venture partners, contractors and suppliers. Westmount Energy also closely guards information entrusted to it by joint venture partners, contractors and suppliers, and seeks to ensure that it is never used improperly.\nOperating Responsibility and Continuous Improvement\nWestmount Energy adopts an environmental policy which sets standards that meet or exceed industry guidelines and host government regulations. This is reviewed on a regular basis. Wherever we operate we will develop, implement and maintain management systems for sustainable development that will strive for continual improvement.\nWestmount Energy is committed to maintaining and regularly reviewing its Health and Safety and Environmental Policies.\nPeriodic feedback from stakeholders, as described in relation to Stakeholder and Social Responsibilities (above), allows the Board to monitor the culture of the Company, as well as its ethical values and behaviours.\nGovernance Structures\nThe Board operates to manage and direct the affairs of the Company via close contact between Board members and through both regular scheduled and ad-hoc Board meetings. The Board aims to meet regularly with a timetable set by the external Company Secretary with formal agendas and papers delivered in advance supporting key matters for consideration or approval. Additionally, contact is maintained between the directors via email and telephone given the geographic separation of the Board.\nMr Walsh as Chairman is responsible for setting the strategy of the Company and maintaining performance of the Board in line with the broad objectives set in that strategy. He is responsible for liaison with key stakeholders, including shareholders and prospective investee companies, and also with advisers and regulatory authorities.\nMr King, as a Jersey resident, maintains close contact with the Company Secretary and other contracted service providers from Jersey. The Board does not operate separate sub-committees (Audit, Remuneration or Nomination) given its small size and close contact for key decisions. The Company does not plan to establish new sub-committees for the foreseeable future.\nThe Board retains full authority for the Company such that all decisions on behalf of the Company are reserved for the Board.\nCommunication with Stakeholders\nThe Company communicates with shareholders through the Annual Report and Audited Financial Statements, annual and half year results announcements, the Annual General Meeting, and periodic meetings with significant institutional shareholders and analysts.\nCorporate information (including all Company publications and announcements) is available to all shareholders, prospective investors and the public and is maintained on the Company's website,\nwww.westmountenergy.com\n.\nIn the last 12 months there were no votes of shareholders where a significant proportion voted against a resolution.\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT\nTO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF WESTMOUNT ENERGY LIMITED\nOpinion\nWe have audited the financial statements of\nWestmount Energy Limited (the 'Company') as at and for the year ended 30 June 2025 which comprise the Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Statement of Financial Position, Statement of Changes in Equity, the Statement of Cash Flows, and the notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRSs') as adopted by the European Union and the requirements of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.\nIn our opinion, the financial statements:\n\u00b7\ngive a true and fair view of the state of the Company's affairs as at\n30 June 2025 and of its loss for the year then ended;\n\u00b7\nhave been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and\n\u00b7\nhave been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.\nBasis for opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.\nWe are independent of the Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Jersey, including the Financial Reporting Council's Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.\nAn overview of the scope of our audit\nDuring our audit planning, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements including the consideration of where directors made subjective judgements, for example, in respect of the assumptions that underlie significant accounting estimates and their assessment of future events that are inherently uncertain. We tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole taking into account the Company, its accounting processes and controls and the industry in which it operates.\nEmphasis of matter\nWe draw your attention to note 6 and note 12 of the financial statements, which include unlisted investments held by the Company and carried at \u00a33,535,961 (2024:4,274,285) based on Directors' valuations. These are Level III investments and have been valued based on the recent sales price of the investments and/or using relevant market proxies where available. The Directors have also considered market expectations of future performance of the entity's industry sector, in particular known interest in the area of current exploration, in arriving at their valuations. Our audit opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\nKey audit matters\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) we identified, including those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. we have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.\nKey Audit Matter\nHow the matter was addressed in the audit\nRisk of incorrect valuation of unquoted investment\nThe valuation of the Company's investments is a key driver of the Company's investment return and investments represent a material proportion of the Company's financial assets. The relevant accounting policies and investment composition are discussed in note 2, note 6 and note 12 to the financial statements.\nAs of 30 June 2025, the investments comprise listed and unlisted equity instruments valued at \u00a30.15 million and \u00a33.54 million, respectively. The primary risk is associated with the unlisted equity instruments, whose valuation involves a higher degree of judgement by the directors. These instruments have been valued based on the price of recent investments, classifying them as Level III investments.\nThe valuation of these Level III investments has been determined using the recent sales price of the investments and/or relevant market proxies where available. In addition, the Directors have taken into account market expectations of the future performance of the entity's industry sector, particularly considering the known interest in current exploration activities, to arrive at their valuations. This valuation methodology is in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Guidelines (IPEVC Guidelines).\nOur main audit procedures to address the identified risk in respect of the unlisted investment were:\n\u00a7\nwe discussed with management their unlisted valuation methodology, and assessed the recognition and measurement of the unlisted investment held for compliance with IFRSs, and whether it had been accounted for in accordance with the stated accounting policy and with IPEVC Guidelines;\n\u00a7\nwe substantiated the nature and background of recent transactions which had been used as the basis of the valuation.\n\u00a7\nwhere the price of recent transaction does not coincide to the Company's year-end, we have performed independent research about events or conditions that may indicate the need to recalibrate the price to consider the impact of such event or condition.\nKey Observations\nWe have not identified any material issues from the completion of the above procedures. We conclude that the valuation of unquoted investment in accordance with the requirements of Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRSs') as adopted by the European Union\nRisk of management override of controls\nManagement is in unique position to perpetrate fraud because of management's ability to manipulate accounting records and prepare fraudulent financial statements by overriding controls that otherwise appear to be operating effectively. Although the level of risk of management override of controls will vary from entity to entity, the risk is nevertheless present in all entities. Due to the unpredictable way in which such override could occur, it is a risk of material misstatements due to fraud and thus a significant risk.\nOur main audit procedures in respect of Management Override of Controls were as follows:\n\u00a7\nWe have obtained understanding of the financial reporting process.\n\u00a7\nWe have reviewed opening balances and completeness of journals.\n\u00a7\nWe have reviewed high-risk journals as part of our testing.\n\u00a7\nWe have reviewed accounting estimates and potential management bias.\nKey Observations\nWe did not note any material issues arising from the procedures performed in this area.\nGoing Concern\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis as discussed in note 2. The Company has negative retained earnings. We included the going concern assumption as a key audit matter given the continued losses and the Company's cash reserve compared to the annual expenses\nOur main audit procedures in respect of Going Concern were as follows:\n\u00b7\nInquiry with management on its view on going concern of the company\n\u00b7\nObtain management assessment of going concern\n\u00b7\nReview cash flow forecasts and budget\nKey Observations\nWe did not note any material issues arising from the procedures performed in this area.\nOur application of materiality\nWe apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our audit, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements on our audit and on the financial statements. For the purposes of determining whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement we define materiality as the level of misstatement that would probably influence the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person.\nWe have used approximately 5% of net assets, or \u00a3197,000 which reflects the fact that this is an investment fund where its market value is determined predominantly by its net asset value.\nConclusions relating to going concern\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Director's use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.\nOur evaluation of the directors' assessment of the Company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included understanding the nature of the Company, its business model, system of internal control and related risks, reviewing the performance of the underlying investments, critically assessing the key assumptions made by management including its appropriateness in the context of the financial reporting framework, and evaluating the directors' plans for future actions in relation to their assessment.\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.\nOther information\nThe directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements, or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\nMatters on which we are required to report by exception\nIn the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the chairman's review or the directors' report.\nWe have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\u00b7\nadequate accounting records have not been kept, or\n\u00b7\nreturns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n\u00b7\nthe financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\nwe have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.\nResponsibilities of directors\nAs explained more fully in the\nstatement of directors' responsibilities with regard to the financial statements\nset out on page 15, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\nAuditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\nExplanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\nThe objectives of our audit in respect of fraud, are to identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements due to fraud; to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the assessed risks of material misstatement due to fraud, through designing and implementing appropriate responses to those assessed risks; and to respond appropriately to instances of fraud or suspected fraud identified during the audit. However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both management and those charged with governance of the Company.\nOur approach was as follows:\n\u00b7\nWe obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to the Company and considered that the most significant but not limited to the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, AIM Rule 26 and the applicable OTCQB Market standards (until the voluntarily withdrawal from OTCQB on 02 December 2024). We also reviewed the laws and regulations applicable to the Company that has indirect impact to the financial statements.\n\u00b7\nWe obtained an understanding of how the Company complies with these requirements by discussions with management and those charged with governance.\n\u00b7\nWe assessed the risk of material misstatement of the financial statements, including the risk of material misstatement due to fraud and how it might occur, by holding discussions with management and those charged with governance.\n\u00b7\nWe inquired of management and those charged with governance as to any known instances of non-compliance or suspected non-compliance with laws and regulations.\n\u00b7\nWe reviewed the compliance reports and minutes of the meeting to see whether there is non-compliance reported to management and those charged with governance.\n\u00b7\nBased on this understanding, we designed specific appropriate audit procedures to identify instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. This included making enquiries of management and those charged with governance and obtaining additional corroborative evidence as required.\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.\nUse of our report\nThis report is made solely to the Company's shareholders as a body, in accordance with Article 113A of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's shareholders those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company's shareholders as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\nPhillip Callow\nFor and on behalf of Moore Stephens Audit and Assurance (Jersey) Limited\n1 Waverley Place\nUnion StreetSt Helier JerseyChannel Islands JE4 8SG\nDate\nSTATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2025\nYear ended 30 June 2025\nYear ended 30 June 2024\nNotes\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nNet fair value losses on financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss\n6\n(295,478)\n(491,941)\nInvestment income\n1,893\n11,969\nFinance income\nAdministrative expenses\n4\n1,607\n(254,317)\n3,320\n(265,915)\nForeign exchange losses\n(5,499)\n(3,167)\nOperating loss\n(551,794)\n(745,734)\nLoss before tax\n(551,794)\n(745,734)\nTax\n3\n-\n-\nLoss after tax\n(551,794)\n(745,734)\nOther comprehensive income\n-\n-\nTotal comprehensive loss for the year\n(\n551,794\n)\n(\n745,734\n)\nBasic earnings per share (pence) continuing and total operations\n5\n(0.38)\n(0.52)\nDiluted earnings per share (pence) continuing and total operations\n5\n(0.38)\n(0.52)\nThe Company has no items of other comprehensive income.\nSTATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION\nAS AT 30 JUNE 2025\nAs at\nAs at\n30 June 2025\n30 June 2024\nNotes\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nASSETS\nNon-current assets\nFinancial assets held at fair value through profit or loss\n6\n3,535,961\n4,274,285\n3,535,961\n4,274,285\nCurrent assets\nFinancial assets held at fair value through profit or loss\n6\n153,342\n-\nOther receivables and prepayments\n7\n38,137\n56,401\nCash and cash equivalents\n8\n281,883\n222,304\n473,362\n278,705\nTotal assets\n4,009,323\n4,552,990\nLIABILITIES AND EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities\nTrade and other payables\n9\n58,911\n50,784\n58,911\n50,784\nTotal Liabilities\n58,911\n50,784\nEQUITY\nStated capital\n10\n16,652,482\n16,652,482\nShare based payment reserve\n11\n-\n469,670\nRetained deficit\n(12,702,070)\n(12,619,946)\nTotal equity\n3,950,412\n4,502,206\nTotal liabilities and equity\n4,009,323\n4,552,990\nThese financial statements were approved and authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 18 November 2025 and were signed on its behalf by:\nD R King\nDirector\n18 November 2025\nSTATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2025\nStated\nShare-based\nRetained\nTotal\ncapital\npayment reserve\ndeficit\nequity\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nAs at 1 July 2023\n16,652,482\n469,670\n(11,874,212)\n5,247,940\nComprehensive income\nTotal Comprehensive loss for the year ended 30 June 2024\n-\n-\n(745,734)\n(745,734)\nAs at 30 June 2024\n16,652,482\n469,670\n(12,619,946)\n4,502,206\nComprehensive income\nTransfer of share-based payment reserve\n-\n(469,670)\n469,670\n-\nTotal Comprehensive loss for the year ended 30 June 2025\n-\n-\n(551,794)\n(551,794)\nAs at 30 June 2025\n16,652,482\n-\n(12,702,070)\n3,950,412\nSTATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2025\nYear ended 30 June 2025\nYear ended 30 June 2024\nNotes\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nCash flows from operating activities\nLoss for the year\n(551,794)\n(745,734)\nAdjustments for:\nNet fair value losses on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\n6\n295,478\n491,941\nMovement in other receivables and prepayments\n18,264\n1,552\nMovement in trade and other payables\n8,127\n(3,655)\nNet cash used in operating activities\n(229,925)\n(255,896)\nCash flows from investing activities\nProceeds from return of capital on investment\n289,504\n-\nNet cash used in investing activities\n289,504\n-\nNet increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n59,579\n(255,896)\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of year\n222,304\n478,200\nCash and cash equivalents at end of year\n8\n281,883\n222,304\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2025\n1.\nGENERAL INFORMATION AND STATEMENTS OF COMPLIANCE WITH INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS AS ADOPTED BY THE EUROPEAN UNION\nWestmount Energy Limited (the \"Company\") operates solely as an energy investment company. The investment strategy of the Company is to invest in and provide follow on capital to small and medium sized companies that have significant growth possibilities.\nThe Company was incorporated in Jersey on 1 October 1992 under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended, and is a public company with registered number 53623. The Company is listed on the London Stock Exchange Alternative Investment Market (\"AIM\") and was formerly available for cross-trading on the OTCQB Market in New York, U.S. under the ticker symbol \"WMELF\". On 8 November 2024, the Company decided to voluntarily withdraw from the OTCQB Market cross-trading facility. Trading ceased effective 2 December 2024.\nBasis of Preparation\nThe financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (\"IFRS Accounting Standards\") and applicable legal and regulatory requirements of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention except for the valuation of financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss.\nThe Directors have assessed the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least eighteen months from the reporting date. During the year, the Company incurred operating losses, which raised concerns regarding its ability to meet obligations as they fall due. However, these losses are primarily non-cash in nature. In addition, the Company holds significant highly liquid assets in the form of quoted investments, which can be readily disposed of to generate funds if required. Based on these factors, the Directors believe that the Company has sufficient resources to continue as a going concern.\n2.\nACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe significant accounting policies that have been applied in the preparation of these financial statements are summarised below.\u00a0These accounting policies have been used throughout all periods presented in the financial statements.\nNew standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are effective in the current year\nAmendments to IAS 21 'Lack of Exchangeability'\nThe above amendments which have become effective from 1 January 2025 and have therefore been adopted do not have a material effect on the \ufb01nancial statements of the Company.\nNew standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been adopted early by the Company\nIFRS 18 'Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements' (1 January 2027)\nAmendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 'Amendments to the Classification and Measurement of Financial Instruments' (1 January 2026)\nAt the date of authorisation of these financial statements, certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published but are not yet effective and have not been adopted early by the Company. The Company is currently assessing their impact, particularly of IFRS 18 which the Company expects may change the format and subtotals presented in the primary financial statements and may enhance note disclosures.\nUse of estimates and judgements\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS Accounting Standards requires the use of accounting estimates and the exercise of judgement by management while applying the Company's accounting policies.\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit and loss that are not listed have been valued in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards using the International Private Equity and Venture Capital (\"IPEVC\") Guidelines and information received from the investment entity. The inputs to value these assets require significant estimates and judgements to be made by the Directors. The Directors have considered the sensitivity of the valuations as detailed in note 12.\nFunctional and presentation currency\nThe functional currency of the Company is United Kingdom Pounds Sterling (\"Sterling\"), the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates. The presentation currency of the Company for accounting purposes is also Sterling.\nForeign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated into Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling on the last day of the Company's financial year. Foreign currency non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into Sterling using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined. Foreign currency transactions are translated at the exchange rate ruling on the date of the transaction. Gains and losses arising on the currency translation are included in administrative expenses in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the year in which they arise.\nFinancial instruments\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\n(a) Classification\nThe Company classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:\n- those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensive income or through profit or loss); and\n- those to be measured at amortised cost.\nThe classification depends on the entity's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows. The Company determines the classification of its financial assets and financial liabilities at initial recognition.\nFinancial liabilities which are not financial liabilities held at fair value through profit or loss are classified as other financial liabilities and held at amortised cost.\n(b) Recognition and measurement\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.\nSubsequent to initial recognition, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are re-measured at fair value.\nFor listed investments, fair value is determined by reference to stock exchange quoted market bid prices at the close of business at the end of the reporting year, without deduction for transaction costs necessary to realise the asset. For non-listed investments fair value is determined by using recognised valuation methodologies, in accordance with the IPEVC Guidelines.\nGains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which they arise.\nSubsequent measurement of the Company's debt instruments depends on the model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset.\nThe Company measures debt instruments at amortised cost if they are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. The Company recognises any impairment loss on initial recognition and any subsequent movement in the impairment provision in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.\nDebt instruments which do not represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at fair value through profit or loss.\nFinancial liabilities, which includes borrowings, are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are re-measured at fair value. Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which they arise.\n(b) Impairment\nUnder IFRS 9,\u00a0the impairment model requires the recognition of impairment provisions based on expected credit losses (\"ECL\") rather than only incurred credit losses as was the case under IAS 39. IFRS 9 permits a simplified approach to trade and other receivables which allows the Company to recognise\u00a0the loss allowance at initial recognition and throughout its life at an amount equal to lifetime ECL.\u00a0ECL are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. A credit loss is the difference between the cash flows that are due to an entity in accordance with the contract and the\u00a0cash flows that the entity expects to receive discounted at the original effective interest rate. ECL consider the amount and timing of payments, thus a credit loss arises even if the entity expects to be paid in full but later than when contractually due.\nThe historical default rate has been considered by the Directors and there is no history of bad debt. Under IFRS 9 ECL Model as well, which is forward looking, all factors that could contribute to expected future losses have been considered by the Directors and there is no expectation of credit loss in the future. As such the Directors concluded that there is no material impact on the financial statements.\n(c) Derecognition\nA financial asset or part of a financial asset is derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired and substantially all risks and rewards of the asset have been transferred.\nThe Company derecognises a financial liability when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expired.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash held in banks and cash with broker.\nEquity, reserves and dividend payments\nOrdinary shares are classified as equity. Transaction costs associated with the issuing of shares are deducted from stated capital. Retained deficit include all current and prior period retained profits and losses.

The Company's overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Company's financial performance.\na)\nMarket risk\ni) Foreign exchange risk\nThe Company's functional and presentation currency is Sterling. The Company is exposed to currency risk through its investments in Africa Oil Corp, Cataleya, JHI and Ratio, and cash at bank. The Directors have not hedged this exposure.\nCurrency exposure as at 30 June:\nAssets and net exposure\n2025\nAssets and net exposure\n2024\nCurrency\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nUS Dollars\n1,495,172\n1,764,237\nCanadian Dollars\n2,047,350\n2,470,594\nIsraeli Shekel\n5,892\n3,365\nTotal\n3,548,414\n4,238,196\nIf the value of Sterling had strengthened by 5% against all of the currencies, with all other variables held constant at the reporting date, the equity attributable to equity holders and the loss for the year would have decreased by \u00a3177,093 (2024: \u00a3203,814). The weakening of Sterling by 5% would have an equal but opposite effect. The calculations are based on the foreign currency denominated financial assets as at year end and are not representative of the period as a whole.\nii) Price risk\nPrice risk is the risk that the fair value of the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market prices. The Company is exposed to price risk on the investments held by the Company and classified by the Company on the Statement of Financial Position as at fair value through profit or loss. To manage its price risk, management closely monitor the activities of the underlying investments.\nThe Company's exposure to price risk is as follows:\nFair value\n\u00a3\nFair Value Through Profit or Loss, as at 30 June 2025\n3,689,303\nFair Value Through Profit or Loss, as at 30 June 2024\n4,274,285\nWith the exception of JHI and Cataleya, the Company's investments are all publicly traded and listed on either the AIM, OTCQB, Tel Aviv Stock Exchange or Toronto Stock Exchange. A 30% increase in market price would decrease the pre-tax loss for the year and increase the net assets attributable to ordinary shareholders by \u00a346,003 (2024: \u00a3187,383). A 30% reduction in market price would have increased the pre-tax loss for the year and reduced the net assets attributable to shareholders by an equal but opposite amount. 30% represents management's assessment of a reasonably possible change in the market prices.\nA 30% increase in the market price of JHI and Cataleya would decrease the pre-tax loss for the year and increase the net assets attributable to ordinary shareholders by \u00a31,060,788 (2024: \u00a31,094,903). A 30% reduction in market price would have increased the pre-tax loss for the year and reduced the net assets attributable to shareholders by an equal but opposite amount. 30% represents management's assessment of a reasonably possible change in the market price of JHI and Cataleya based on the price of share purchases over the last two years.\niii) Interest\nrate\nrisk\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Company is not exposed to material interest rate risk.\nb)\nCredit risk\nCredit risk is the risk that an issuer or counterparty will be unable or unwilling to meet commitments it has entered into with the Company. The Directors do not believe the Company is subject to any significant credit risk exposure regarding trade receivables.\nAt the end of the reporting period, the Company's financial assets exposed to credit risk amounted to the following:\n2025\n2024\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nCash and cash equivalents\n281,883\n222,304\nThe Company considers that all the above financial assets are not impaired or past due for each of the reporting dates under review and are of good credit quality.\nc)\nLiquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company cannot meet its liabilities as they fall due. The Company's primary source of liquidity consists of cash and cash equivalents and those financial assets which are publicly traded and held at fair value through profit or loss and which are deemed highly liquid.\nThe following table details the contractual, undiscounted cash flows of the Company's financial liabilities:\nAs at 30 June 2025\nUp to 3 months\nUp to 1 year\nOver 1 year\nTotal\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nFinancial liabilities\nTrade and other payables\n58,911\n-\n-\n58,911\n58,911\n-\n-\n58,911\nAs at 30 June 2024\nUp to 3 months\nUp to 1 year\nOver 1 year\nTotal\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nFinancial liabilities\nTrade and other payables\n50,784\n-\n-\n50,784\n50,784\n-\n-\n50,784\nCapital Management\nThe Company's objective when managing capital is to safeguard the Company's ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide optimum returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce cost of capital.\nIn\norder to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company may issue new shares, return capital to shareholders or sell assets. The Company does not have any debt nor is the Company subject to any external capital requirements.\nFair Value Estimation\nThe Company has classified its financial assets as fair value through profit or loss and fair value is determined via one of the following categories:\nLevel I - An unadjusted quoted price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and is used to measure fair value whenever available. As required by IFRS 7, the Company will not adjust the quoted price for these investments, (even in situations where it holds a large position and a sale could reasonably impact the quoted price).\nLevel II - Inputs are other than unadjusted quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date, and fair value is determined through the use of models or other valuation methodologies.\nLevel III - Inputs are unobservable for the investment and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the investment. The inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation.\nThe following table shows the classification of the Company's financial assets:\nLevel I\nLevel II\nLevel III\nTotal\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nAt 30 June 2025\n153,342\n-\n3,535,960\n3,689,302\nAt 30 June 2024\n624,609\n-\n3,649,676\n4,274,285\nThe Company has classified quoted investments as Level I, derivative financial instruments as Level II and unquoted investments as Level III. The Level III investment is at an early stage of development and therefore has been valued based on the recent price of the investment. The Directors have considered current market conditions and market expectations of future performance of the entity's industry sector, in particular known interest in the area of current exploration. As such, the Directors consider that the recent price of the investment in Cataleya, which is the price of the ROC transaction in January 2023, fairly reflects the value of the investment as at 30 June 2025. Following the most recent completed transaction in January 2022 which is the acquisition by Eco (Atlantic) Oil and Gas Ltd. of JHI shares, the Directors have used this price as their basis for determining the Company's fair value investment in JHI. There have been no movements in classifications during the year.\nA reconciliation of the movements in Level III investments is shown below:\n2025\n2024\n\u00a3\n\u00a3\nAt start of the year\n3,649,676\n4,049,925\nChange in fair value\n(113,716)\n(400,249)\nAt end of the year\n3,535,960\n3,649,676\n13.\nDIRECTORS' REMUNERATION AND SHARE OPTIONS\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nDirectors' fees\n\u00a3\nDirectors' fees\n\u00a3\nOptions outstanding\nOptions outstanding\nD R King\n20,000\n20,000\n-\n-\nD Corcoran\n-\n-\n-\n-\nG Walsh\n20,000\n20,000\n-\n-\nT O'Gorman\n20,000\n20,000\n-\n-\n60,000\n60,000\n-\n-\nAt\nthe year end the Company owed \u00a325,000 (2024: \u00a310,000) in outstanding Directors' fees.\nDuring the year consultancy fees of \u00a320,042 (2024: \u00a323,940) were paid to D Corcoran.\nNo options were granted during the current year. No options were exercised during the current nor prior years.\nThe shares held by the Directors are declared in the Directors' report.\nThe Company does not employ any staff except for its Board of Directors. The Company does not contribute to the pensions or any other long-term incentive schemes on behalf of its Directors.\n14.\nRELATED PARTIES\nAs at the balance sheet date, Canaccord Genuity as a significant shareholder of the Company was considered a related party under AIM rules. The Company paid \u00a3391 in Custody fees to Canaccord Genuity for the year (2024: \u00a3462).\nAs noted in Note 16, Canaccord Genuity ceased to be a related party after significantly reducing its shareholding in the Company in July 2025.\nThe shares held by the Directors are declared in the Directors' report.\n15.\nCONTROLLING PARTY\nIn the opinion of the Directors, the Company does not have a controlling party.\n16.\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nIn July 2025, the Company received 33,987 JHI shares from Argos by way of post liquidation pro rata distribution of assets to Argos shareholders.\nAlso in July 2025, Canaccord Genuity ceased to be a related party because of its disposal of a significant ownership interest in the Company.\nApart from the aforementioned, there are no other significant events subsequent to the year-end that require adjustment or disclosure in the financial statements.\n17.\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nThere are no commitments or contingencies other than those mentioned in these financial statements.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

JHI currently holds 100% W.I. in PL001 via a wholly owned subsidiary, JHI Falkland Inc. (\n\"JHIF\"\n). PL001 is located immediately to the west of PL032 containing the Navitas operated Sea Lion Project which recently achieved Final Investment Decision with respect to Phase 1 of this giant development complex with over 700 MMbbls of recoverable resources.\nPL001, which covers approximately 1,126 square kilometres, is located in modest water depths (<500m), is fully covered by 3D seismic and contains significant exploration potential. JHI's internal Best Estimates indicate a prospect inventory containing an aggregate 3.1bn bbls of prospective recoverable resources with an aggregate upside of more than 10 bn bbls\n2\n. So far, two oil prospects, Tyche and Dinlas, have been high-graded within the same stratigraphic interval as the Sea Lion accumulation - each containing a potential 400 MMbbls recoverable\n2\n.\nJHI is a private, Ontario-registered, company established in 2014 and focused on oil exploration opportunities in the emerging Guyana-Suriname and North Falklands basins. Westmount holds a total of 5,685,257 shares in JHI, representing approximately 6.24% of the issued share capital.\nGerard Walsh Chairman of Westmount Energy Ltd. commented:\n\"We are delighted to see this significant follow-on transaction on the back of the recent reawakening of interest in our offshore Falkland Islands and Guyanese assets.\nA tie-up of the North Falklands Basin PL001 Licence with the incumbent operator of the giant Sea Lion Development presents significant potential opportunity in terms of synergies re sub-surface understanding, rig sharing and production facilities in the success case.\"\n1\nhttps://maya.tase.co.il/he/reports/1716562\n2\nhttps://www.jhiassociates.com/north-falkland-basin\nFor further information, please contact:\nWestmount Energy Limited\nwww.westmountenergy.com\nDavid King, Director Tel: +44 (0) 1534 823000\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\n(Nomad and Broker) Tel: +44 (0) 20 7397 8900\nNeil McDonald / Pete Lynch\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Against a backdrop of geopolitical tensions, conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, international sanctions plus tariff and trade uncertainties, electricity demand growth from data centres and AI businesses - governments have been forced to focus on maintaining secure and affordable energy supplies, in some cases at the expense of net-zero aspirations. Global primary energy demand is estimated to have increased by 2% in 2024 - higher than the average increase for the past ten years\n1\n- underpinned by continued steady growth in oil and gas demand - notwithstanding the massive investment and rapid growth in renewable energies such as wind and solar during recent years.\nThe general consensus is that oil and natural gas resources will be needed for many decades to come with some forecasts indicating that oil and natural gas will make up more than half of the world's energy supply in 2050. Oil demand is anticipated to stabilize after 2030, remaining above 100 million barrels per day through 2050. However, demand for natural gas is forecast to rise by more than 20% - driven by higher electricity demand in developing countries2. Since the 2014 oil price crash upstream capital available for oil and gas investment has declined abruptly from USD$779 billion per annum, with investment in 2025 estimated to be around USD$570 billion3. Oil and gas production is a depletion business with nearly 90% of this annual investment in recent years dedicated to offsetting production declines rather than to meeting demand growth. This implies that modest drops in annual upstream investment can choke off supply growth. Furthermore, the IEA indicates that oil and gas field depletion may be progressing faster than previously believed which suggests that the industry will need to invest more on exploration just to sustain the current rate of production.\nWhile the longer-term outlook for the E&P sector continues to be positive the near-term picture with respect to supply/demand balance is uncertain - with Brent prices retreating in the last year from a peak above $80/bbl to below $65/bbl in early November 2025. A combination of non-OPEC+ supply growth and continued unwinding of OPEC+ voluntary cuts point to abundant supply. Simultaneously, with crude inventory building in China and opportunistic replenishment of the US SPR underway, economic uncertainty due to tariffs and realignment of trade relationships is likely to impact economic growth particularly in SE Asia\n4\nand hence near-term oil demand.\nNevertheless, ",

(formerly Africa Oil Corp.;\"\nMER\n\";\nTSX:\nMER.TO,\nNasdaq Stockholm:\nMER.ST), representing all of Westmount's holding in MER.\nIn 2023, while awaiting guidance regarding future drilling activity from the Company's Guyana focused investee companies, Westmount invested part of its treasury into Africa Oil Corp shares, to provide shareholders with some exposure to exploration and appraisal drilling activity around the Venus discovery in the Orange Basin, offshore Namibia. At that time, Africa Oil Corp. held an effective economic interest in the Venus project of circa 6.2% via its shareholding in Impact Oil & Gas Ltd., a private company. Subsequent to Westmount's investment, Africa Oil changed its strategy regarding Venus/Namibian exploration and, following its recent corporate consolidation incorporating Prime Oil, Westmount's net exposure to Venus and the adjacent Orange basin exploration drilling has been substantially diluted.\nThe disposal of MER shares has yielded proceeds of \u00a3286,155 net of all costs. The purchase cost of these shares, in June 2023, was \u00a3538,633 which indicates a net loss of \u00a3224,221 has been incurred after exchange rate movements and attributable dividends of circa \u00a328,255 during the ownership period. The proceeds of the share sale will be used to supplement the Company's available working capital.\nWestmount continues to hold a circa 6.24% interest in JHI Associates Inc. (\"JHI\"), a 4.13% interest in Cataleya Energy Corp. (\"CEC\") and a 0.47% interest in Eco Atlantic Oil and Gas Ltd. (\"ECO\") - investees with direct working interests in exploration licences immediately adjacent to the prolific Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana. JHI retains a 17.5% interest in the Canje Block; CEC has a 50% interest in the Kaieteur Block, containing the Tanager-1 oil discovery; ECO holds a 100% interest and operatorship of the Orinduik block which contains the Jethro and Joe heavy oil discoveries and is immediately adjacent to the giant Hammerhead oil field, currently under development by the Stabroek partners. Frustratingly, Westmount still awaits guidance with respect to future exploration activity on these Guyanese blocks, in spite of clear visibility to the drilling of at least five exploration wells, under less benign fiscal terms, in the Suriname sector during 2025.\nJHI also holds a 100% working interest and operatorship in the North Falklands Basin Production Licence PL001, which was acquired in September 2023 from the then AIM listed Argos Resources Ltd.. PL001 is immediately adjacent to the Navitas Petroleum/Rockhopper Sea Lion development, where FID is expected later this year - an event that is likely to reawaken exploration interest in the neighbouring licences. PL001 is located in modest water depths (1\n. Upon receipt of the outstanding JHI shares (distribution pending since completion of the Argos Resources Ltd. transaction) Westmount's shareholding in JHI will equate to an effective 6.24% economic interest in these prospects and the PL001 licence.\nIn spite of the potential of this portfolio, for some time, Westmount has been valued by the London AIM market as an investment shell, with little or no value being attributed to the private holdings in JHI and CEC. Westmount has no debt and sufficient\ncash resources to fund the minimum (irreducible) corporate overhead into H2 2026, with liquid investments available, if necessary, to increase this runway.\nIn the interim, the board of Westmount continues to actively explore opportunities and strategies to deliver improved shareholder value.\nFurther announcements will be made in due course, as appropriate.\n1\nhttps://www.jhiassociates.com/north-falkland-basin\nFor further information, please contact:\nWestmount Energy Limited\nwww.westmountenergy.com\nDavid King, Director Tel: +44 (0) 1534 823000 email:\nwestmountenergy@stonehagefleming.com\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\n(\nNomad and Broker) Tel: +44 (0) 20 7397 8900\nNeil McDonald/Peter Lynch (Corporate Finance)\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Upon completion of the Argos-JHI transaction, as announced on the 25th September 2023, and subsequent to the voluntary liquidation of Argos and the distribution of JHI Consideration Shares to Argos shareholders it is estimated that Westmount will hold circa 5,684,870 shares in JHI, representing approximately 6.24% of the enlarged issued share capital of JHI.\nAs of 31st December 2024, Westmount holds 474,816 common shares in Cataleya Energy Corporation (\"CEC\") representing approximately 4.13% of the issued shares in CEC, as of 15th March 2024.\nWestmount continues to hold 1,500,000 shares in Eco (Atlantic) Oil & Gas Ltd. (\"EOG\"), representing approximately 0.47% of the common shares in issue as of 13th January 2025.\nWestmount continues to hold 89,653 shares in Ratio Petroleum representing approximately 0.04% of the issued share capital.\nAs of 31st December 2024, Westmount holds 300,000 shares in Africa Oil Corp (\"AOC\") representing approximately 0.069% of the issued common shares in AOC as of 31st January 2025. On the 27th September 2024 AOC paid a cash dividend of USD$0.025 per common share. On 7th March 2024, following completion of the 'Reorganization' transaction first announced on the 24th June 2024, AOC declared a quarterly cash dividend of USD$0.037 per common share, payable on the 11th April 2025 to shareholders of record on the 27th March 2025.\nThe complete investment portfolio is summarised in Table 1.\nThe reported financial loss for the period is primarily made up of a non-cash loss on financial assets held at fair value through the profit and loss, some of which is as a result of Foreign Exchange movements on the portfolio Investments when valued at the period end, and administration costs.\nSummary/Outlook\nWestmount's continues to juggle its liquid resources while seeking value creation for shareholders via exposure to high impact exploration and appraisal drilling programs primarily in the two global 'exploration-hotspots' - deepwater Guyana-Suriname Basin and Orange Basin, Namibia-South Africa.\nExploration drilling in the Guyana-Suriname Basin (outside of the Stabroek Block and Block 58) has started to pick-up again - with clear visibility in the Suriname sector to drilling wells during 2025 - at Araku Deep-1 (Shell, Block 65), Macaw-1 (TotalEnergies, Block 64), Korikori-1 (Chevron, Block 5) in addition to two exploration wells planned by Petronas for Block 52. Notwithstanding the more benign fiscal terms available offshore Guyana uncertainty with respect to the timing of Guyanese drilling remains. Against a backdrop of a dominant player, sector consolidation and the overhang created by the protracted arbitration surrounding the Chevron-Hess takeover, separate farm-down processes are ongoing with respect to the Kaieteur, Canje and Orinduik blocks. With a 1-year licence extension, in the case of the Canje and Kaieteur Blocks, secured - successful completion of farm-down discussions or procurement of other sources of funding, and alignment of incumbent or incoming operators are the next steps.

Rising populations and aspirations for higher living standards continue to drive a relentless growth in demand for energy which is forecast to be only partially offset by energy efficiency gains. Under most scenarios oil and gas are forecast to remain as significant pillars of the energy infrastructure with both underinvestment and geopolitics contributing to the perception that energy market disruption risks are higher on the supply side than the demand side\n1\n. Nevertheless, demand forecasts for oil and gas are more challenging and uncertain as the world grapples with energy transition and net-zero ambitions. For example, wildly conflicting views prevail with respect to the timing of peak oil demand, with OPEC's 2024 Annual World Oil Outlook suggesting oil demand will reach 120 million b/d by 2050, with no peak demand in sight, in stark contrast with the 'Oil 2024' analysis of the International Energy Agency (IEA) which is forecasting peak oil demand towards the end of this decade, with a total supply capacity rising to nearly 113.8 mb/d by 2030, a whopping 8 mb/d above IEA's projected global demand of 105.4 mb/d at that time\n2,3\n.\nIn the near term, global oil demand growth has been slowing sharply from its post pandemic rates driven primarily by a slowing Chinese economy, oil substitution by alternative fuels and the effects of prolonged higher interest rates that have been used to tackle inflation in developed economies. The IEA's September Oil Market report is forecasting 900k b/d demand growth in 2024 versus the 2.3m b/d growth recorded in 2023. Oil prices have traded in the $70-$93/bbl range during the last year - but have demonstrated continued volatility - influenced by geopolitical instability created by the Iran/Israeli and Russia/Ukraine conflicts, OPEC+ posturing and the softening global demand outlook. In early September Brent traded at $70/bbl down from an early April 2024 high of $91/bbl which prompted Saudi Arabia and its OPEC+ allies to announce that they would postpone by two months the start of their planned unwinding of extra voluntary production cuts of 2.2m b/d which had been in place since July 2023.\nIn the meantime, governments continue to recalibrate their energy transition policies and emission reduction targets in the face of energy security concerns and the challenge of energy affordability for ",

(\"\nAOC\n\";\nTSX:\nAOI.TO,\nNasdaq Stockholm:\nAOI.ST) with respect to exploration, appraisal and development activities on Blocks 2913B and 2912, in the Orange Basin, offshore Namibia.\nThe update highlights the resumption of exploration drilling on Block 2913B with the spudding of the Tamboti-1X exploration well - a 1bn bbl target\n1\n- on 20th October 2024. Tamboti-1X, which is being drilled using the DeepSea Mira rig, is located north of the Venus accumulation and close to the Mangetti-1X discovery. The update also notes the completion of two 3D seismic acquisition programs during 2024, which has resulted in most of the Block 2913B and Block 2912 licensed area now being covered by 3D seismic - facilitating the potential for discovery of significant additional resources via follow-on high impact exploration drilling\n2\n.\nIn addition, the update confirms the successful appraisal of the giant Venus light oil accumulation via the drilling and testing of the Venus-1X ST, Venus-1A, Venus-2A and Mangetti-1X appraisal wells. As a result, planning is currently progressing for the first development area, with a Phase 1 development scheme expected to be finalized by the end of 2025.\nFinally, the update reports that AOC's investee company, Impact Oil & Gas Limited (\"Impact\"), has completed the farm-down of its interests in Blocks 2912 and 2913B (\"the Blocks\") to TotalEnergies EP Namibia B.V. (\"TotalEnergies\") - as announced on 10th January 2024.\nFurther to this transaction, Impact has received a cash payment of circa USD$99M (back costs) and\nImpact's retained 9.5% interest in each of the Blocks is fully 'loan carried' for all remaining exploration, appraisal and development costs,\nwith no cap\n, through to sales proceeds from first oil. The carry loan is repayable from a share of Impact's after-tax cash flows, and net of all joint venture costs, including capital expenditures, from production on the Blocks.\nAOC is a publicly listed Independent E&P company with producing and development assets in deep-water Nigeria and a portfolio of exploration and appraisal assets, located offshore west and south Africa as well as offshore Guyana. AOC currently holds its interests through direct ownership interests in concessions and through its shareholdings in private and publicly listed investee companies, including: Prime Oil & Gas Co\u00f6peratief U.A.; Impact Oil & Gas Ltd.; Africa Energy Corp.; and Eco (Atlantic) Oil and Gas Ltd. Up to date detailed disclosure with respect to AOC's overall strategy, portfolio of assets, production guidance, dividend and shareholder return policies is available via its 'Report to Shareholders for the Period Ended June 30, 2024'\nhttps://africaoilcorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AFRICA-OIL-CORP-2024-JuneReport-to-Shareholders.pdf\nOther more recent and historical disclosures are available on its website\nwww.africaoilcorp.com\n.\nAOC currently has a shareholding of approximately 32.4% in Impact. Upon closing of the call and put option agreement with three Impact shareholders, announced on August 27, 2024, AOC will increase its shareholding in Impact to approximately 39.5%, which represents an effective economic interest of approximately 3.8% in the Blocks. Westmount's holding of 300,000 shares in AOC, represents approximately 0.068% of the issued common shares in AOC as of 31st July 2024. This investment provides liquid exposure to the ongoing fully 'loan carried' exploration, appraisal and development activities on Blocks 2913B and 2912 which contain the Venus and Mangetti discoveries and a number of other giant exploration targets.\nGerard Walsh, Chairman of Westmount Energy Ltd. commented:\n\"The announcement by our investee AOC that exploration drilling has recommenced on Block 2913B with the spudding of a 1bn bbl prospect at Tamboti-1X to the north of the giant Venus accumulation, and potential follow-on drilling to the south of Venus, is good news.

The transaction closed on the 15th March 2024 and CEC is now debt free. As a result of this loan note conversion the Noteholder has now become a significant shareholder in CEC, with a shareholding of approximately 21.4% of the enlarged CEC share capital.\nOn 27th September 2023 it was announced that both ExxonMobil and Hess had elected to withdraw from the Kaieteur Block and return their participating interests to the original Kaieteur Licence holders, Ratio Guyana Limited (\"RGL\") and Cataleya Energy Limited (\"CEL\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of CEC. The parties are now awaiting Ministerial approval to reassign the participating interests, so that RGL and CEL will each retain a 50% participating interest, with RGL as the operator of the block.\nIt was also announced that under the terms of the Kaieteur Petroleum Agreement, and upon submission of an application to enter the second extension period, the participating interests on the block will have until February 2025 to commit to drilling a well. A farm-down process is underway with a view to bringing new entrants, including a deepwater operator, to the block.\nPrior to the redemption of these loan notes, Westmount held a total of 474,816 common shares in CEC, representing approximately 5.26% of the issued common shares in CEC. Post redemption of these loan notes, Westmount retains a holding of 474,816 common shares in CEC, representing approximately 4.13% of the enlarged issued share capital of CEC.\nThe southern portion of the Kaieteur Block is covered by a 5,750km2 3D seismic survey, which was acquired in 2017/18 and has provided the foundation for maturing a significant prospect inventory on the block. A single prospect has been drilled to date which resulted in a sub-commercial oil discovery. The ExxonMobil operated Tanager-1 well, which was drilled in H2 2020, encountered 16 metres of net oil pay (20oAPI oil) in high-quality sandstone reservoirs of Maastrichtian age with a volumetric 'Best Estimate' Unrisked Gross (2C) Contingent Oil Resource of 65.3 MMBBLs (Low to High Estimates 17.7 MMBBLs to 131 MMBBLs) - Netherland, Sewell & Associates Inc. (\"NSAI\") published CPR (February 14, 2021).\nGerard Walsh, Executive Chairman of Westmount, commented:\n\"We are very encouraged to see that the Noteholder has become a significant shareholder in CEC via the conversion of\nUSD $22,192,722 of the outstanding loan notes into 2,458,705 CEC common shares\n. We believe that this new investment into CEC reflects confidence that the ongoing farm-down process can bring new partners and a resumption of drilling on the Kaieteur Block, which has been substantially derisked by the Tanager-1 discovery, yet remains underexplored.\"\nFor further information, please contact:\nWestmount Energy Limited\nwww.westmountenergy.com\nDavid King, Director Tel: +44 (0) 1534 823000 email:\nwestmountenergy@stonehagefleming.com\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\n(\nNomad and Broker) Tel: +44 (0) 20 7397 8900\nNeil McDonald/Peter Lynch (Corporate Finance)\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

(\"\nAOC\n\";\nTSX:\nAOI.TO,\nNasdaq Stockholm:\nAOI.ST) with respect to exploration and appraisal activities on Block 2913B, in the Orange Basin, offshore Namibia. The update highlights the prolific nature of the Orange Basin hydrocarbon system with hydrocarbons now demonstrated to be present at two separate stratigraphic levels within Block 2913B. Mangetti-1X, a dual objective exploration and appraisal well, encountered hydrocarbon-bearing intervals in the shallower Mangetti Fan prospect, opening a new play fairway, while also successfully intersecting and appraising the northern area of the deeper Venus discovery. Mangetti-1X has the potential to boost the existing recoverable resource base on Block 2913B and the joint venture partners are now considering the next steps in the evaluation program.\nThe update also confirms that the drilling of Venus-2A, the fourth appraisal well on the giant Venus discovery, is underway using the Deepsea Mira rig. In addition, the acquisition of a 3D seismic program in the southern part of Block 2913B is progressing with a view to highgrading additional exploration targets for drilling.\nAOC is a publicly listed Independent E&P company with producing and development assets in deep-water Nigeria and a portfolio of exploration and appraisal assets, located offshore west and south Africa as well as offshore Guyana. AOC holds its interests through direct ownership interests in concessions and through its shareholdings in private and publicly listed investee companies, including: Prime Oil & Gas Co\u00f6peratief U.A.; Impact Oil & Gas Ltd.; Africa Energy Corp.; and Eco (Atlantic) Oil and Gas Ltd. Up to date detailed disclosure with respect to AOC's overall strategy, portfolio of assets, production guidance, dividend and shareholder return policies is available via its 'Report to Shareholders for the Period Ended September 30, 2023'\nhttps://africaoilcorp.com/site/assets/files/1856/2023-aoi-q3.pdf\nOther more recent and historical disclosures are available on its website\nwww.africaoilcorp.com\n.\nAOC currently has an effective interest of 6.2% in Blocks 2913B and 2912 as a result of its 31% shareholding in Impact Oil & Gas Limited\n1\n. Westmount's holding of 300,000 shares in AOC, represents approximately 0.065% of the issued common shares in AOC as of 31st January 2024. This investment provides liquid exposure to the ongoing testing program of the significant Venus light oil discovery on Block 2913B in addition to the evaluation of other giant exploration targets on the block.\nGerard Walsh, Chairman of Westmount Energy Ltd. commented:\n\"Today's positive update by our investee AOC confirms our view that the Orange basin is a major emerging, prolific, hydrocarbon province which offers Westmount shareholders continuing exposure to high impact exploration and appraisal drilling outcomes. We also note the commentary provided yesterday at the TotalEnergies 2023 Results and 2024 Objectives presentations\n2\n, with the operator of the giant Venus Discovery indicating that the appraisal program and development planning was now focussed on the optimisation of the location of the first Development FPSO with respect to reservoir sweet spots in terms of permeability and productivity. In addition, the operator signalled a continuing aggressive exploration and appraisal program in 2024, with a Namibian E&A budget of circa $300M, and with another potential exploration drilling target already identified to the south of Venus. So an exciting program of drilling and testing lies ahead and we look forward to further newsflow in this regard.\"\n1\nUpon completion of the transaction announced by AOC on the 10th January 2024, AOC's effective interest in Blocks 2913B and 2912 will reduce to 2.95% and Impact Oil & Gas Limited will retain a 9.5% interest in Blocks 2912 and 2913B that is fully carried for all joint venture costs, with no cap, through to first commercial production.\nhttps://africaoilcorp.com/news/africa-oil-announces-strategic-farmout-of-impacts-122899/\n2\nhttps://totalenergies.com/sites/g/files/nytnzq121/files/documents/2024-02/TotalEnergies_2023_Results_and_2024_Objectives_presentation.pdf\nFor further information, please contact:\nWestmount Energy Limited\nwww.westmountenergy.com\nDavid King, Director\nTel: +44 (0) 1534 823000\nemail:\nwestmountenergy@st",

After peaking at over $120 per barrel in June 2022, the average monthly Brent crude price had declined to less than $75 per barrel by June 2023 in response to slowing international trade and the perceived risk of a global recession. This gloomy macroeconomic outlook was reinforced by tightening monetary policies in all the major economies, with prolonged higher interest rates being used to tackle persistent inflation. In addition, the disruption in global supply chains caused by the war in Ukraine and a major slowdown in the property market in China, the primary oil demand growth centre, have also contributed to reduced world trade flows. In May 2023, the OPEC+ alliance moved to support slumping oil prices with a strategy of aggressive supply restraint - initially with several members agreeing a collective reduction in oil production of 1.2 million b/d. This strategy was further bolstered in July with unilateral declarations of additional voluntary cuts in production of 1 million b/d by Saudi Arabia and 500k-300k b/d by Russia - voluntary cuts which have subsequently been extended to year end. The net effect has been a sharp rebound in oil prices throughout the summer months with Brent crude reaching circa $95 per barrel in late September before the rally petered out in the face of renewed macroeconomic concerns and signs of demand destruction in the US and some emerging markets.\nIn the meantime, governments continue to recalibrate their energy transition policies and emission reduction targets in the face of energy security concerns sparked by the war in Ukraine and the challenge of energy affordability for citizens grappling with cost-of-living increases on the back of global inflationary pressures. Notwithstanding record global EV sales and battery and solar installations in 2022 and the massive investment and buildout of renewable energy capacity over the past 5 years, renewables have only met 51% of new energy demand during this period, with fossil-fuel use continuing to grow in absolute\nterms and energy related CO2 emissions continuing to rise\n1\n. Conflicting views also prevail with respect to the timing of peak oil demand, with OPEC's Annual World Oil Outlook suggesting peak oil demand will not be reached until 2045, at 116 million b/d, in stark contrast with the analysis of the International Energy Agency (IEA) which is forecasting oil demand peaking, at circa 106 million b/d, prior to 2030\n2,3\n. Recently announced giant M&A deals by ExxonMobil/Pioneer Natural Resources and Chevron/Hess Corporation reinforces the view that oil and gas are going to continue to play a role for some time.

(\"\nAOC\n\";\nTSX:\nAOI.TO,\nNasdaq Stockholm:\nAOI.ST) with respect to exploration and appraisal activities on Blocks 2913B and 2912, in the Orange Basin, offshore Namibia. The update heralds a major milestone in the appraisal of the giant Venus light oil discovery with the successful re-entry, sidetracking and drill stem testing (\"DST\") of the Venus-1X discovery well, which should contribute to the progression of development studies supporting the first commercial development in Block 2913B.\nThe update also confirms the successful drilling, coring and logging of the first appraisal well, Venus-1A, which was drilled, using the Tungsten Explorer drillship, approximately 13km north of the Venus-1X discovery well. Venus-1A will now be re-entered in the coming days and undergo a DST program using the Deepsea Mira rig.\nFollowing the completion of operations at the non-commercial Nara-1X exploration well on Block 2912 the Tungsten Explorer drillship will now mobilize to drill the substantial Mangetti-1X prospect, located on Block 2913B, immediately to the north of the giant Venus light oil accumulation\n1\n.\nAOC is a publicly listed Independent E&P company with producing and development assets in deep-water Nigeria and a portfolio of exploration and appraisal assets, located offshore west and south Africa as well as offshore Guyana. AOC holds its interests through direct ownership interests in concessions and through its shareholdings in private and publicly listed investee companies, including: Prime Oil & Gas Co\u00f6peratief U.A.; Impact Oil & Gas Ltd.; Africa Energy Corp.; and Eco (Atlantic) Oil and Gas Ltd. Up to date detailed disclosure with respect to AOC's overall strategy, portfolio of assets, production guidance, dividend and shareholder return policies is available via its 'Report to Shareholders for the Period Ended March 31, 2023'\nhttps://africaoilcorp.com/site/assets/files/1842/africa_oil_corp_-_2023_june_30_-report_to_shareholders.pdf.\nOther more recent and historical disclosures are available on its website\nwww.africaoilcorp.com\n.\nAOC has an effective interest of 6.2% in Block 2913B and an effective interest of 5.9% in Block 2912 as a result of its 31% shareholding in Impact Oil & Gas Limited. Westmount's holding of 300,000 shares in AOC, represents approximately 0.065% of the issued common shares in AOC as of 28th August 2023. This investment provides liquid exposure to the ongoing testing program of the significant Venus light oil discovery on Block 2913B in addition to the evaluation of other giant targets on the block, including the imminent drilling of the Mangetti-1x exploration well.\nGerard Walsh, Chairman of Westmount Energy Ltd. commented:\n\"Today's positive update by our investee AOC confirms our view that the Orange basin is a major emerging, prolific, hydrocarbon province which offers Westmount shareholders continuing exposure to high impact drilling outcomes, including the imminent Magnetti-1 exploration well. We also note the commentary provided yesterday at the TotalEnergies Investor Day presentations, with the operator of the giant Venus Discovery sufficiently confident, after the initial testing program of the Venus-1X discovery well, to declare that there will be an oil field development at Venus, thereby underpinning the forward appraisal and exploration program on Block 2913B. So an exciting program of testing and drilling lies ahead and we look forward to further newsflow in this regard.\"\n1\nhttps://totalenergies.com/sites/g/files/nytnzq121/files/documents/2023-09/TotalEnergies_2023_Strategy_Outlook_presentation.pdf\nFor further information, please contact:\nWestmount Energy Limited\nwww.westmountenergy.com\nDavid King, Director Tel: +44 (0) 1534 823000 email:\nwestmountenergy@stonehagefleming.com\nCavendish Securities plc\n(\nNomad and Broker) Tel: +44 (0) 20 7397 8900\nNeil McDonald/Peter Lynch (Corporate Finance)\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The parties will now seek government approval to reassign the participating interests, so that Ratio Guyana Limited and Cataleya Energy Limited will each retain a 50% participating interest, and appoint Ratio Guyana Limited as the operator of the block. .\nThe current Kaieteur Block participating interests are as follows:\nEsso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited 35% (operator)\nRatio Guyana Limited 25%\nCataleya Energy Limited 20%\nHess Guyana (Block B) Exploration Limited 20%\nAfter reassignment of the participating interests the revised Kaieteur Block interests will be as follows:\nRatio Guyana Limited 50% (operator)\nCataleya Energy Limited 50%\nIt is also noted that the announcement by Ratio Petroleum states that under the terms of the Kaieteur Petroleum Agreement, and upon submission of an application to enter the second extension period\n2\n, the participating interests on the block will have until February 2025 to commit to drilling a well. Furthermore, it is noted, that Ratio Petroleum is seeking a farm-down of participating interests and operatorship and, in this context, is already in discussions with major oil companies with a view to bringing a new entrant or entrants to the block.\nIn this regard, it is also of note that the two deepwater blocks (D1 & D2), immediately adjacent to the Kaieteur block, have been the subject of at least one application during the recent Guyanese Bid Round\n3\nwhich offered acreage under less benign fiscal terms than the original Kaieteur Block terms.\nIn 2020, the first well drilled on the Kaieteur block, Tanager-1, evaluated a number of plays - encountering 16 metres of net oil pay (20oAPI oil) in high-quality sandstone reservoirs of Maastrichtian age and confirming the extension of the Cretaceous petroleum system and the Liza play fairway outboard from the prolific discoveries on the neighbouring ExxonMobil operated Stabroek Block. The well was reported as an oil discovery which is currently considered to be noncommercial as a standalone development. Tanager-1 also encountered high quality reservoirs in deeper Santonian and Turonian plays though interpretation of the reservoir fluids in these intervals was reported to be equivocal and requirefurther analysis.\nA post-well Netherland, Sewell & Associates Inc. (\"NSAI\") published CPR\n4\nindicates that the Tanager-1 Maastrichtian discovery contains a 'Best Estimate' Unrisked Gross (2C) Contingent Oil Resource of 65.3 MMBBLs (Low to High Estimates 17.7 MMBBLs to 131 MMBBLs) - with a 'Best Estimate' Unrisked Net (2C) Contingent Oil Resource attributable to the Kaieteur Block of 42.7 MMBBLs (Low to High Estimates 11.3 MMBBLs to 86 MMBBLs).\nWestmount holds approximately 5.26% of the issued share capital of Cataleya Energy Corporation\n5\n, the parent company of CEL and circa 0.04% of the issued share capital of Ratio Petroleum the ultimate holding entity with respect to Ratio Guyana Limited.\n1\nPrevious announcements by Ratio Petroleum indicate that, under a farm-in agreement executed with ExxonMobil in 2016, the original Kaieteur 2nd well prospect nomination date was 22nd August 2021, with any drilling consequent to this decision to commence within nine months of the nomination date. The prospect nomination date was subsequently extended twice by agreement to 22nd March 2022 and again to the 2nd October 2023.\n2\nThe Kaieteur Petroleum Agreement is currently in the first extension period, which began on February 2, 2021 and lasts for 3 years.\n3\nhttps://oilnow.gy/featured/ali-jagdeo-see-guyana-oil-bid-responses-as-favourable-given-governments-terms/\n4\nCPR by Netherland, Sewell & Associates Inc.

The influx of foreign direct investment is mainly flowing to the oil and gas sector which is currently dominated by an inventory of upstream development projects on the Stabroek Block operated by ExxonMobil, with Hess Corporation and CNOOC as partners. Guyana is now established as a significant oil producing nation with rapidly progressing offshore developments, including the expected installation of at least 6 Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) units on the Stabroek Block by end 2027 (with a production capacity of more than 1 million BOPD) and the potential for up to 10 FPSOs based upon the current discovered resource inventory of in excess of 11 billion barrels of oil equivalent.\n1,2,3\nIn parallel with the development of the already discovered resource offshore Guyana, the multi-billion barrels undiscovered upside in the basin continues to attract aggressive exploration investment, driven by large prospects, low breakeven costs, low carbon emissions and the energy transition dynamics. It is anticipated that Guyana's total recoverable oil deposits will increase as exploration activities expand to deeper plays and other offshore blocks, which remain underexplored. The Stabroek Block partners reported a total of nine significant discoveries during 2022 (Fangtooth-1, Lau Lau-1, Patwa-1, Lukanani-1, Barreleye-1, Seabob-1, Kiru Kiru-1, Yarrow-1 and Sailfin-1) bringing the total number of discoveries to date, on the Stabroek block to thirty.\n4\nThe positive outcome at Fangtooth-1 is of particular significance as this was the first well dedicated to a deep exploration target in the Stabroek area, with the results indicating the potential for commercial exploitation of the deeper plays and offering encouragement for the drilling of deep targets elsewhere in the basin, including on the Kaieteur and Canje Blocks. The potential for a significant deep discovery at Fangtooth was confirmed in January 2023 when the Stabroek partners reported that 61 metres of oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs had been encountered at Fangtooth SE-1, which was drilled circa 13 kms to the southeast of the original Fangtooth-1 discovery.\nOutside of Stabroek, in May 2022, the Joint Venture of CGX Energy Inc. and Frontera Energy Corporation announced a discovery at Kawa-1 in the north of the Corentyne Block. Logging of this well indicated 69 metres of net hydrocarbon pay across multiple Upper Cretaceous reservoirs. Reservoir fluids are uncertain as MDT fluid samples were not obtained from the well, though third-party analyses indicated the presence of light oil in the deeper Santonian and Coniacian reservoirs, and gas condensate in the shallower Maastrichtian and Campanian, consistent with neighbouring discoveries on the Stabroek block and in Block 58, Suriname.\n5\nKawa-1 was plugged and abandoned and the commercial potential of the discovery has yet to be determined. After realignment of stakeholder interests on the Corentyne Block a follow-up joint exploration/appraisal effort, Wei-1, was spudded on 20 January 2023, targeting stacked Campanian and Santonian channel sandstone reservoirs and is currently drilling ahead.\nSeparately, in December 2022, the Guyanese government launched a Licensing Round for 14 offshore blocks (3 deepwater and 11 shallow water blocks) under revised fiscal and contractual terms including biddable signature bonus with a minimum threshold of USD $20M and $10M for deepwater and shallow water blocks, respectively. In parallel, the government has indicated that some other blocks, ex Licensing Round, have been set aside with a view to exploration and development of these blocks via strategic dir",

The ROC Transaction completed on 6 January 2023.\nThe ROC Transaction has been structured such that each Participating Shareholder effectively receives, for each Common Share held prior to the transaction that is ultimately cancelled pursuant to the ROC Transaction, an amount equal to approximately USD$3.906 per share. The aggregate amount to be returned to participating CEC shareholders via the ROC Transaction is approximately USD $6,720,000, with these funds being provided to CEC through the issuance of incremental convertible loan notes to a certain noteholder (the \"\nNoteholder\n\") that previously advanced USD$35,000,000 to CEC in April 2020.\nPrior to the ROC Transaction, Westmount held a total of 567,185 Common Shares in CEC, representing approximately 5.28% of the issued common shares in CEC. Post completion of the ROC Transaction, Westmount holds a total of 474,816 Common Shares in CEC, retaining approximately 5.26% of the issued common shares of CEC outstanding post the ROC transaction, and will receive USD$355,954 (net of expenses).\nCEC holds, via its 100% owned subsidiary Cataleya Energy Ltd.

A single well, Tanager-1, has been drilled on the Kaieteur Block to date and was announced, in November 2020, as an oil discovery which is currently considered to be non-commercial as a standalone development.\nSubsequent to that, in May 2021, it was reported that Hess Corporation had increased its stake in the Kaieteur Block via the acquisition of an additional 5% WI from CEL.\nIn March 2022, it was announced that the date for elective nomination, by the operator ExxonMobil, of the prospect target for the 2nd well on the Kaieteur Block had been extended to 2 October 2023.\nGerard Walsh, Executive Chairman of Westmount, commented:\n\"We are very encouraged to see new investment into CEC reflecting confidence that a resumption of drilling on the Kaieteur Block will occur post the October 2023 elective nomination date. It is also heartening to see that this ROC Transaction is being executed without tapping CEC's existing cash balances, thereby allowing CEC to remain very well financed via cash and multiple well carries for future drilling activity.\"\nFor further information, please contact:Westmount Energy Limited\nwww.westmountenergy.com\nDavid King, Director Tel: +44 (0) 1534 823059\nAnita Weaver\nCenkos Securities plc\n(\nNomad and Broker) Tel: +44 (0) 20 7397 8900\nNicholas Wells/Neil McDonald/Pete Lynch (Corporate Finance)\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Spiking demand, fostered by various government stimuli and accommodative monetary policies, had already resulted in tightening supply chains prior to the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February and subsequent disruptions caused by the western response via sanctions imposed upon Russia. While global oil demand has rebounded towards pre-COVID levels of approximately 100 MMbbls per day, supply has struggled to keep up as reflected in the seven successive quarters of declining global oil inventories prior to April 2022. From mid-year the global economic outlook has started to weaken as spiralling inflation has resulted in tightening monetary policies, higher interest rates and bearish equity markets. Brent oil prices which peaked above USD $120 per barrel in June have since continued to slide to below USD $90 per barrel in early October on the back of recessionary concerns. Nevertheless, while the long-term picture suggests that growth in global oil demand will continue to decelerate, the near-term outlook remains volatile. Factors that are likely to influence near term prices include - the tapering of Strategic Petroleum Reserve releases to the market; switching from gas to oil for electricity generation due to high gas prices; potential ending of zero-COVID policy and rolling lockdowns in China, the world's largest oil importer; impact of 2 MMbbls per day OPEC+ supply cuts announced in early October; the trajectory of the war in Ukraine and associated western sanctions; trends in exchange rates, with current US dollar strength dampening demand for dollar denominated commodities like oil.\nWhile there is evidence that long term GDP growth has started to decouple from total energy demand and CO2 emissions growth, the short-term trajectory indicates increasing global energy demand\n1\n. Regional underperformance of some renewable energy sources together with the ongoing war in Ukraine is reshaping the immediate energy transition narrative, bringing greater focus on energy security, system resilience and affordability in the near term. Europe, in particular, faces significant challenges with respect to energy security and affordability while trying to decarbonize - in the context of re-engineering its supply chains to substitute for previous oil and gas imports from Russia. Longer term the conflicting challenges of growing the global energy supply by about 20 percent over the next 20 years while reaching net zero emissions by 2050 is being undermined by underinvestment in the oil and gas sector. As the recent 'unintended consequences' of over reliance on renewable energy and/or single suppliers of energy have shown, energy transition is complex and multi-dimensional which suggests that multiple reliable sources of energy including low cost, low carbon, oil and gas that can be rapidly commercialised, will have a role to play in the energy system for decades to come.\nDuring the last twelve months Guyana has continued its journey towards becoming a significant oil producing nation with rapidly progressing offshore developments, including the expected installation of at least six Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) units on the Stabroek Block by end 2027 (with a production capacity of more than 1 million BOPD) and the potential for up to 10 FPSOs based upon the current discovered resource inventory of in excess of 11 billion barrels of oil equivalent.\n2,3\nThree of these FPSOs are already operating or are under construction - with the Liza Phase 1 (Destiny FPSO) producing at a rate of 140,000 BOPD during 2022 (20,000 BOPD above nameplate capacity), Liza Phase 2 (Unity FPSO",

Within the oil sector these forces translated into robust demand, struggling supply even within the OPEC+ disciplinary framework and dwindling stockpiles. With the booming demand for oil and gas, accentuated in part by poor regional performance of some renewable sources of energy, outpacing supply, prices continued to surge with Brent settling above USD$91/bbl by the end of January 2022. All of this prior to the emergence of geopolitical turmoil sparked by the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, with increased volatility and oil price rises accelerating thereafter, briefly touching USD$140/bbl for Brent in early March. Oil prices continue to rally on the back of coordinated sanctions imposed by western governments and businesses, including an outright ban on Russian energy imports by the US administration, a phasing out of Russian oil imports by the UK before year end and ongoing discussions within the EU where some members risk considerable economic pain if such a ban is agreed.\nDuring the second half of the year Guyana has continued its journey towards becoming a significant oil producing nation with rapidly progressing offshore developments, including the expected installation of at least six Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) units on the Stabroek Block by 2027 (with a production capacity of more than 1 million BOPD) and the potential for up to 10 FPSOs based upon the current discovered resource inventory of in excess of 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent.\n1,2\nThree of these FPSOs are already operating or are under construction - with the Liza Phase 1 (Destiny FPSO) expected to reach a production rate of 140,000 BOPD during 2022 (20,000 BOPD above nameplate capacity), Liza Phase 2 (Unity FPSO) on stream since February 2022 with ramp-up to its full production capacity of 220,000 BOPD expected later in the year and with a third field development, Payara (Prosperity FPSO), also with 220,000 BOPD capacity, on track for start-up in 2024. In addition, the Stabroek consortium has submitted a 4th development plan for government and regulatory review, with respect to the Yellowtail discoveries, targeting a gross production capacity of 250,000 BOPD and first oil in 2025. A number of follow-on developments are also envisaged, including a 5th project centred on the Uaru discovery\n1\n, subject to government approvals and project sanctioning.\nIn parallel with the development of the already discovered resource offshore Guyana, the multi-billion barrels undiscovered upside in the basin continues to attract aggressive exploration investment, driven by large prospects, low breakeven costs, low carbon emissions and the energy transition dynamics. In October 2021, on the back of a string of exploration successes, estimates of gross discovered resources on the Stabroek Block were revised upwards to approximately 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The preceding exploration drilling 'purple patch' included discoveries at Redtail-1, Yellowtail-2, Uaru-2, Mako-2, Longtail-3, Turbot-2, Whiptail-1, Whiptail-2, Pinktail-1 and Cataback-1 bringing the total number of reported significant discoveries to date on the Stabroek Block to twenty-one.

L\n, USA OTCQB:\nWMELF\n), notes the announcement by Ratio Petroleum Energy Limited Partnership (\"Ratio Petroleum\") earlier today, that the date for elective nomination, by the operator, of the prospect target for the 2nd well on the Kaieteur Block has been extended to the 2nd October, 2023. The Kaieteur Block partners agreed to this extension to facilitate continuing geological and geophysical analysis by the operator and integration of recent and ongoing deep play drilling program results on adjacent blocks into the Kaieteur prospect nomination decision. All costs will be carried by the operator during this extension period\n1\n.\nThe first well drilled on the Kaieteur block, Tanager-1, evaluated a number of plays - encountering 16 metres of net oil pay (20oAPI oil) in high-quality sandstone reservoirs of Maastrichtian age and confirming the extension of the Cretaceous petroleum system and the Liza play fairway outboard from the prolific discoveries on the neighbouring ExxonMobil operated Stabroek Block. The well was reported as an oil discovery which is currently considered to be non-commercial as a standalone development. Tanager-1 also encountered high quality reservoirs in deeper Santonian and Turonian plays though interpretation of the reservoir fluids in these intervals was reported to be equivocal and require further analysis.\nA post-well Netherland, Sewell & Associates Inc. (\"NSAI\") published CPR\n2\nindicates that the Tanager-1 Maastrichtian discovery contains a 'Best Estimate' Unrisked Gross (2C) Contingent Oil Resource of 65.3 MMBBLs (Low to High Estimates 17.7 MMBBLs to 131 MMBBLs) - with a 'Best Estimate' Unrisked Net (2C) Contingent Oil Resource attributable to the Kaieteur Block of 42.7 MMBBLs (Low to High Estimates 11.3 MMBBLs to 86 MMBBLs).\nSubsequent to the Tanager-1 discovery Hess Corporation increased its working interest (\"WI\") in the Kaieteur Block from 15% to 20% by acquiring a 5% WI from Cataleya Energy Limited (\"CEL\").\nThe current Kaieteur Block partners are as follows:\nEsso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited\n35% (operator)\nRatio Guyana Limited\n25%\nCataleya Energy Limited\n20%\nHess Guyana (Block B) Exploration Limited\n20%\nWestmount holds approximately 5.3% of the issued share capital of Cataleya Energy Corporation\n3\nthe parent company of CEL and circa 0.04% of the issued share capital of Ratio Petroleum the ultimate holding entity with respect to Ratio Guyana Limited.\n1\nAnnouncements by Ratio Petroleum indicate that, under a farm-in agreement executed with ExxonMobil (operator) in 2016, any drilling consequent to the 2nd well prospect nomination decision will commence within nine months of the nomination date. The operator, as farminee, continues to bear all farmor JV expenses during the prospect nomination extension period.\n2\nCPR by Netherland, Sewell & Associates Inc.

Upon the publication of this Announcement via Regulatory Information Service (\"\nRIS\n\"), this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n1st November 2021\nWESTMOUNT ENERGY LIMITED\n(\"Westmount\" or the \"Company\")\nSapote-1 Results\nWestmount Energy Limited (\nUK AIM: WTE.L, USA OTCQB: WMELF\n), the AIM-quoted oil and gas investing company focussed on the Guyana-Suriname Basin reports that it has received a shareholder communication from its investee company, JHI Associates Inc. (\"JHI\"), which confirms that the Sapote-1 well on the Canje Block was safely drilled in 2,549 meters of water by the Stena DrillMAX drillship to a total depth of 6,758 meters. The well encountered non-commercial hydrocarbons in one of the deeper exploration targets\n1\n.\nWestmount holds an indirect interest in the Canje Block as a result of its circa 7.2% interest in the issued share capital of JHI\n2\n.\nFollowing a 2018 farm-out to Total and subsequent transactions, JHI is funded for additional drilling post the Sapote-1 well.\nThe Canje Block is currently operated by an ExxonMobil subsidiary, Esso Exploration & Production Guyana Limited (35%), with TotalEnergies E&P Guyana B.V. (35%), JHI Associates (BVI) Inc. (17.5%) and Mid-Atlantic Oil & Gas Inc. (12.5%) as partners.\nGerard Walsh, Executive Chairman of Westmount, commented:\n\"Sapote-1 is the sixth well, offshore Guyana, that Westmount has participated in via our investee companies, since 2019. This portfolio of drilling outcomes has yielded 3 oil discoveries, but no standalone commercial success to date. While this outcome from the Westmount portfolio is below expectations the results to date provide encouragement and must be viewed in the context of initial 'large step-out' wells, in a frontier setting, evaluating giant stratigraphic prospects while seeking to establish the perimeter of the multiple play fairways both to the northeast and southwest of the prolific Stabroek Block.\"\n\"The immediate focus of the Canje Joint Venture group now switches to synthesis, analysis and regional integration and modelling of the extensive multi-play data suite acquired during the 2021 drilling campaign with a view to highgrading and selection of the potential follow-on drilling targets on the block. In this regard, we note that the operator of the Canje Block, has already submitted, to the Guyanese Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), an application for environmental authorisation with respect to a new 12 well drilling program on the block from 2022.\n3\n1\nJHI shareholder communication dated 29th October, 2021\n2\nBased on JHI's issued share capital inferred from JHI transaction dated 28th June 2021\n3\nhttps://www.epaguyana.org/epa/project-summary2/summary/5-project-summary/770-canje-12-well-project-summary\nFor further information, please contact:\nWestmount Energy Limited\nwww.westmountenergy.com\nDavid King, Director Tel: +44 (0) 1534 823059\nAnita Weaver\nCenkos Securities plc\n(\nNomad and Broker) Tel: +44 (0) 20 7397 8900\nNicholas Wells/Neil McDonald (Corporate Finance)\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The green shoots of economic recovery that were in evidence in the second half of 2020 have continued to sprout in 2021. Vaccination programs and improving management strategies are pointing towards light at the end of the pandemic tunnel. Increasing economic activity, population mobility and oil demand, combined with OPEC+ supply discipline, has driven a sustained oil price rally over this period with Brent crude trading consistently above US$80/bbl since the start of October. While the clean energy transition has also gained momentum during this period, the redirected capital flows and poor regional performance of some renewable sources (wind and hydro) during summer 2021 have had some unintended consequences - such as gas shortages in Europe and Asia boosting demand for crude - while adding significantly, at least in the near term, to gas and oil pricing pressures. So, while pandemic threats remain in the form of mutant strains, other economic threats are now moving centre stage - such as rising inflation driven by rebound demand and spiking energy prices - together with uncertainties around future energy policies, the pace and direction of decarbonisation and energy capital allocation decisions in the face of an array of technologies with variable cost, carbon and reliability profiles, not to mention societal impacts. As the 'unintended consequences' in 2021 have shown energy transition is complex and multi-dimensional which suggests that reliable sources of energy such as low cost, low carbon oil and gas that can be rapidly commercialised, will have a role to play in the energy system for decades to come.\nDuring the last 12 months the development of the upstream sector in Guyana has continued to power ahead making Guyana the world's fastest growing economy in 2020 with standout economic growth of over 40%. Building on the foundations of a world class petroleum province the country continues its transformation towards a significant oil producing nation - with potential for the installation of at least 6 Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) units on the Stabroek Block by 2027 and a discovered resource inventory, to date, which underpins up to 10 FPSOs\n3\n. Three of these FPSOs are already operating or are under construction - with the Liza Phase 1 (Destiny FPSO) reaching its plateau production rate of 120,000 BOPD during the past year, Liza Phase 2 (Unity FPSO) about to commence installation and hook-up offshore Guyana and on track to achieve first oil in early 2022, with a capacity of 220,000 BOPD and with a third field development, Payara (Prosperity FPSO), also with 220,000 BOPD capacity, undergoing topsides fabrication at drydock in Singapore and targeting first oil in 2024. In addition, it is anticipated that the Stabroek consortium will submit to the government a 4th development plan, for the Yellowtail discoveries, by the end of 2021, targeting a gross production capacity of 220,000-250,000 BOPD and first oil in 2025. At this stage a number of follow-on developments are also envisaged including development of the Mako/Uaru and Whiptail discoveries, subject",

          "content": "Supra3 Yep is all looking good!  Thats a nice return, I actually got some at 0.5p at the end of July, some more at circa 1p and the rest more recently cira 2p so average somewhere at the 1p mark so close to 300% return or so.   Short term target of 3.5p reached - just trying to crunch some number but mid term targets for WTE are looking very much to be somewhere north of 12p.  Excluding all other areas they are involved in FID for RKH has surely got to have an impact on the WTE sp and indeed that of ECO. Just re-capping that WTE have 6.24% of JHI who own 100% of PL001 which has at least 800MB's of oil.  All this slap bang next door to RKH and... just for a bit of extra candy we have Navitas now linking up with ECO who have 7% of JHI and previously considered taking over JHI and left the door open to reconsider a takeover offer at a later date.  Its all really coming together!  I can't take the credit for ECO, I've mentioned it on RKH message board but I wasn't the first, can't remember who it was now,  Think maybe Malaysia888 might have been one of the original reccommenders?? Anyway, you and I and indeed a good many others are currently doing very well here with WTE and long may it continue for us all! Come on RKH FID.... Best wishes to you Supra and indeed everyone else.

Just look at Navitas/RKH right next door,  WTE has the PL001 indirect interest of 6.24% via JHI.  ECO Atlantic also have an interest in JHI and indeed were considering taking them over previously.  Navitas and ECO recent deal and WTE has interests in ECO.  That is all very incestuous!  Plus we have all WTE other interests to take into account too. Watch this space! Very best wishes JPDM",

If  there was indeed  to be a similar deal struck and split for JHI in PL001 then if that similar valuation to Sealion and RKH would value JHI at \u00a3600M for 35% of PL001 then WTE 6.25% of JHI in the PL001 would be \u00a337.5M valuation.  THat excludes all the other assets and investments that WTE have!  So.... \u00a337.5M divided by 144M shares gives my medium/longer term target price of around 26p per share!  There's the maths.

Yes, they have a load of prospects to go at, look a likes of Sea Lion, but that's all. RKH had a fully appraised Sea lion, an almost complete EIS and FDP that Navitas needed to update and they still all they got for 65% of the whole acreage was two loans, no cash up front. Even Harbour paid them something like $6m to take Sea Lion off their hands! So, Im' not saying JHI's Argos acreage hasn't got any value, it surely does, but cash upfront and carry on drilling might be a stretch too far. Still something is a foot here and it will be interesting to see how it all fits together with Eco. Maybe as has been mentioned, ECO might take them out with Navitas so Nav gets it's hands on Argos old acreage and tidies things up a bit. Interesting times. LTT",

At that point in time could a valuation of RKH of \u00a3600M been forecast. Time will tell but there is definitely a momentum happening with Falkland related stocks and my money is on what may or could happen right next door to Sealion in PL001.

However it's all good if Eco and Navitas take over JHI, then old Argos shareholders are back in the game with a rig coming down to drill Sea Lion late 2026/early 2027, with no doubt down time to pop a well or too in PL001. Things are getting very exciting and interesting, something has to give soon. LTT",

I was interested to hear they have a stake of I believe was said 6.4% in JHI but having had a quick scan of their accounts albeit 2024 accounts nothing is jumping out.  They mention their interests in South Africa, Namibia and Guyana but nothing mentioned for the Falklands or indeed JHI.  I'm probably being dump and missed something, have you got anything to reference their stake in JHI?    What I would say is that on the Investors Chronicle site and indeed CEO Corp presentation of the 23rd October 2025 there is no mention although I did see some mention on the Investor Chronicle site of 1x Analyst putting out a price target of 124.92p!!!  and rated as 'Outperform' If there is some concrete info relating to an interest in JHI then I would certainly have a dabble as that would effectively be 'untapped opportunity!! Let us know if you have anything. All the best JPDM",

Sadly he left us five and a half years ago for the oil rig in the sky. He passed due to a sudden heart attack, just the way he wanted it, no long drawn out affair. I still have many of his shares in The Rock and hope they come good for him. Also holding a few WTE. I don't post on the RKH board anymore as garbled drives me crazy. It's good to hear from so many of the old DES crowd. Whatever happened to Oilbrat? A great poster of old. Xmt, I remember your phone call on the day RKH hit \u00a35. Are you still in Aberdeen? Looking forward to FID and the next few years. Just remember to enjoy it. CaptDuckling",

As regards the rest of the portfolio it's difficult to judge, especially Cataleya which is private. The value component arising from Eco Atlantic can be accurately measured since this quoted on LSE and important recent developments there. But share of Eco held by WTE not huge. The key WTE elements are JHI and Catalaya but both at the present are private so tricky to get a handle.",

Thats a nice return, I actually got some at 0.5p at the end of July, some more at circa 1p and the rest more recently cira 2p so average somewhere at the 1p mark so close to 300% return or so.   Short term target of 3.5p reached - just trying to crunch some number but mid term targets for WTE are looking very much to be somewhere north of 12p.  Excluding all other areas they are involved in FID for RKH has surely got to have an impact on the WTE sp and indeed that of ECO. Just re-capping that WTE have 6.24% of JHI who own 100% of PL001 which has at least 800MB's of oil.  All this slap bang next door to RKH and... just for a bit of extra candy we have Navitas now linking up with ECO who have 7% of JHI and previously considered taking over JHI and left the door open to reconsider a takeover offer at a later date.  Its all really coming together!  I can't take the credit for ECO, I've mentioned it on RKH message board but I wasn't the first, can't remember who it was now,  Think maybe Malaysia888 might have been one of the original reccommenders?? Anyway, you and I and indeed a good many others are currently doing very well here with WTE and long may it continue for us all! Come on RKH FID.... Best wishes to you Supra and indeed everyone else.

I think there are some really exciting times ahead here and also indirectly there is a multitude of potential deals etc that could come together.  Just look at Navitas/RKH right next door,  WTE has the PL001 indirect interest of 6.24% via JHI.  ECO Atlantic also have an interest in JHI and indeed were considering taking them over previously.  Navitas and ECO recent deal and WTE has interests in ECO.  That is all very incestuous!  Plus we have all WTE other interests to take into account too. Watch this space! Very best wishes JPDM",

If  there was indeed  to be a similar deal struck and split for JHI in PL001 then if that similar valuation to Sealion and RKH would value JHI at \u00a3600M for 35% of PL001 then WTE 6.25% of JHI in the PL001 would be \u00a337.5M valuation.  THat excludes all the other assets and investments that WTE have!  So.... \u00a337.5M divided by 144M shares gives my medium/longer term target price of around 26p per share!  There's the maths.

RKH had a discovery and a fully appraised one at that, what have JHI got in Agros' old acreage, Johnston Gas discovery encroaching into their acreage and some 3D. Yes, they have a load of prospects to go at, look a likes of Sea Lion, but that's all. RKH had a fully appraised Sea lion, an almost complete EIS and FDP that Navitas needed to update and they still all they got for 65% of the whole acreage was two loans, no cash up front. Even Harbour paid them something like $6m to take Sea Lion off their hands! So, Im' not saying JHI's Argos acreage hasn't got any value, it surely does, but cash upfront and carry on drilling might be a stretch too far. Still something is a foot here and it will be interesting to see how it all fits together with Eco. Maybe as has been mentioned, ECO might take them out with Navitas so Nav gets it's hands on Argos old acreage and tidies things up a bit. Interesting times. LTT",

At that point in time could a valuation of RKH of \u00a3600M been forecast. Time will tell but there is definitely a momentum happening with Falkland related stocks and my money is on what may or could happen right next door to Sealion in PL001.

However it's all good if Eco and Navitas take over JHI, then old Argos shareholders are back in the game with a rig coming down to drill Sea Lion late 2026/early 2027, with no doubt down time to pop a well or too in PL001. Things are getting very exciting and interesting, something has to give soon. LTT",

JHI value has probably gone up quite considerably now and with the Navitas potential involvement I need to sit down and try and work out the \u2018mechanics\u2019 of how this would all go forward.  Eg.  Would JHI float?  Get taken over and if so then what valuation do you pin on JHI.  Maybe the route would be a float by JHI. Creates even more musings!!! Best wishes JPDM",

I think there are some really exciting times ahead here and also indirectly there is a multitude of potential deals etc that could come together.  Just look at Navitas/RKH right next door,  WTE has the PL001 indirect interest of 6.24% via JHI.  ECO Atlantic also have an interest in JHI and indeed were considering taking them over previously.  Navitas and ECO recent deal and WTE has interests in ECO.  That is all very incestuous!  Plus we have all WTE other interests to take into account too. Watch this space! Very best wishes JPDM",

If  there was indeed  to be a similar deal struck and split for JHI in PL001 then if that similar valuation to Sealion and RKH would value JHI at \u00a3600M for 35% of PL001 then WTE 6.25% of JHI in the PL001 would be \u00a337.5M valuation.  THat excludes all the other assets and investments that WTE have!  So.... \u00a337.5M divided by 144M shares gives my medium/longer term target price of around 26p per share!  There's the maths. Good luck to all Best wishes and Good fortune to all JPDM FM",

RKH had a discovery and a fully appraised one at that, what have JHI got in Agros' old acreage, Johnston Gas discovery encroaching into their acreage and some 3D. Yes, they have a load of prospects to go at, look a likes of Sea Lion, but that's all. RKH had a fully appraised Sea lion, an almost complete EIS and FDP that Navitas needed to update and they still all they got for 65% of the whole acreage was two loans, no cash up front. Even Harbour paid them something like $6m to take Sea Lion off their hands! So, Im' not saying JHI's Argos acreage hasn't got any value, it surely does, but cash upfront and carry on drilling might be a stretch too far. Still something is a foot here and it will be interesting to see how it all fits together with Eco. Maybe as has been mentioned, ECO might take them out with Navitas so Nav gets it's hands on Argos old acreage and tidies things up a bit. Interesting times. LTT",

However it's all good if Eco and Navitas take over JHI, then old Argos shareholders are back in the game with a rig coming down to drill Sea Lion late 2026/early 2027, with no doubt down time to pop a well or too in PL001.

Two of the prospects each hold the potential of 400MMbls oil recoverable each. Rockhoppers 35% stake of sealion is currently worth around \u00a3500M and WTE's 6.24% of PL001 and 800MMbls oil+ is currently valuing WTE at just \u00a33M !!!

I was interested to hear they have a stake of I believe was said 6.4% in JHI but having had a quick scan of their accounts albeit 2024 accounts nothing is jumping out.  They mention their interests in South Africa, Namibia and Guyana but nothing mentioned for the Falklands or indeed JHI.  I'm probably being dump and missed something, have you got anything to reference their stake in JHI?    What I would say is that on the Investors Chronicle site and indeed CEO Corp presentation of the 23rd October 2025 there is no mention although I did see some mention on the Investor Chronicle site of 1x Analyst putting out a price target of 124.92p!!!  and rated as 'Outperform' If there is some concrete info relating to an interest in JHI then I would certainly have a dabble as that would effectively be 'untapped opportunity!! Let us know if you have anything. All the best JPDM",

However it's all good if Eco and Navitas take over JHI, then old Argos shareholders are back in the game with a rig coming down to drill Sea Lion late 2026/early 2027, with no doubt down time to pop a well or too in PL001. Things are getting very exciting and interesting, something has to give soon. LTT",

Time will tell but there is definitely a momentum happening with Falkland related stocks and my money is on what may or could happen right next door to Sealion in PL001.

RKH had a discovery and a fully appraised one at that, what have JHI got in Agros' old acreage, Johnston Gas discovery encroaching into their acreage and some 3D. Yes, they have a load of prospects to go at, look a likes of Sea Lion, but that's all. RKH had a fully appraised Sea lion, an almost complete EIS and FDP that Navitas needed to update and they still all they got for 65% of the whole acreage was two loans, no cash up front. Even Harbour paid them something like $6m to take Sea Lion off their hands! So, Im' not saying JHI's Argos acreage hasn't got any value, it surely does, but cash upfront and carry on drilling might be a stretch too far. Still something is a foot here and it will be interesting to see how it all fits together with Eco. Maybe as has been mentioned, ECO might take them out with Navitas so Nav gets it's hands on Argos old acreage and tidies things up a bit. Interesting times. LTT",

LOL I have great confidence in WTE  shares rising again soon and making us all a fortune. You may ask will I regret selling a portion. The answer, no, I have never regretted de-risking when the opportunity is ripe. I have several free holdings using this method. Each to their own and the very best of luck to all.",

If  there was indeed  to be a similar deal struck and split for JHI in PL001 then if that similar valuation to Sealion and RKH would value JHI at \u00a3600M for 35% of PL001 then WTE 6.25% of JHI in the PL001 would be \u00a337.5M valuation.  THat excludes all the other assets and investments that WTE have!  So.... \u00a337.5M divided by 144M shares gives my medium/longer term target price of around 26p per share!  There's the maths. Good luck to all Best wishes and Good fortune to all JPDM FM",

I think there are some really exciting times ahead here and also indirectly there is a multitude of potential deals etc that could come together.  Just look at Navitas/RKH right next door,  WTE has the PL001 indirect interest of 6.24% via JHI.  ECO Atlantic also have an interest in JHI and indeed were considering taking them over previously.  Navitas and ECO recent deal and WTE has interests in ECO.  That is all very incestuous!  Plus we have all WTE other interests to take into account too. Watch this space! Very best wishes JPDM",

Thats a nice return, I actually got some at 0.5p at the end of July, some more at circa 1p and the rest more recently cira 2p so average somewhere at the 1p mark so close to 300% return or so.   Short term target of 3.5p reached - just trying to crunch some number but mid term targets for WTE are looking very much to be somewhere north of 12p.  Excluding all other areas they are involved in FID for RKH has surely got to have an impact on the WTE sp and indeed that of ECO. Just re-capping that WTE have 6.24% of JHI who own 100% of PL001 which has at least 800MB's of oil.  All this slap bang next door to RKH and... just for a bit of extra candy we have Navitas now linking up with ECO who have 7% of JHI and previously considered taking over JHI and left the door open to reconsider a takeover offer at a later date.  Its all really coming together!  I can't take the credit for ECO, I've mentioned it on RKH message board but I wasn't the first, can't remember who it was now,  Think maybe Malaysia888 might have been one of the original reccommenders?? Anyway, you and I and indeed a good many others are currently doing very well here with WTE and long may it continue for us all! Come on RKH FID.... Best wishes to you Supra and indeed everyone else.

Or could Eco revive their deal to take out JHI to not only tie up PL001, but also their Guyana acreage? with WTE having a MC of around \u00a312m, Eco could do either, take out WTE or take over JHI? I wonder what the implications are for taking over JHI, does WTE get a percentage of the new Eco enlarged company? Just some musings. LTT",

However it's all good if Eco and Navitas take over JHI, then old Argos shareholders are back in the game with a rig coming down to drill Sea Lion late 2026/early 2027, with no doubt down time to pop a well or too in PL001. Things are getting very exciting and interesting, something has to give soon. LTT",

RKH had a discovery and a fully appraised one at that, what have JHI got in Agros' old acreage, Johnston Gas discovery encroaching into their acreage and some 3D. Yes, they have a load of prospects to go at, look a likes of Sea Lion, but that's all. RKH had a fully appraised Sea lion, an almost complete EIS and FDP that Navitas needed to update and they still all they got for 65% of the whole acreage was two loans, no cash up front. Even Harbour paid them something like $6m to take Sea Lion off their hands! So, Im' not saying JHI's Argos acreage hasn't got any value, it surely does, but cash upfront and carry on drilling might be a stretch too far. Still something is a foot here and it will be interesting to see how it all fits together with Eco. Maybe as has been mentioned, ECO might take them out with Navitas so Nav gets it's hands on Argos old acreage and tidies things up a bit. Interesting times. LTT",

LOL I have great confidence in WTE  shares rising again soon and making us all a fortune. You may ask will I regret selling a portion.

If  there was indeed  to be a similar deal struck and split for JHI in PL001 then if that similar valuation to Sealion and RKH would value JHI at \u00a3600M for 35% of PL001 then WTE 6.25% of JHI in the PL001 would be \u00a337.5M valuation.  THat excludes all the other assets and investments that WTE have!  So.... \u00a337.5M divided by 144M shares gives my medium/longer term target price of around 26p per share!  There's the maths.

I think there are some really exciting times ahead here and also indirectly there is a multitude of potential deals etc that could come together.  Just look at Navitas/RKH right next door,  WTE has the PL001 indirect interest of 6.24% via JHI.  ECO Atlantic also have an interest in JHI and indeed were considering taking them over previously.  Navitas and ECO recent deal and WTE has interests in ECO.  That is all very incestuous!  Plus we have all WTE other interests to take into account too. Watch this space! Very best wishes JPDM",

Thats a nice return, I actually got some at 0.5p at the end of July, some more at circa 1p and the rest more recently cira 2p so average somewhere at the 1p mark so close to 300% return or so.   Short term target of 3.5p reached - just trying to crunch some number but mid term targets for WTE are looking very much to be somewhere north of 12p.  Excluding all other areas they are involved in FID for RKH has surely got to have an impact on the WTE sp and indeed that of ECO. Just re-capping that WTE have 6.24% of JHI who own 100% of PL001 which has at least 800MB's of oil.  All this slap bang next door to RKH and... just for a bit of extra candy we have Navitas now linking up with ECO who have 7% of JHI and previously considered taking over JHI and left the door open to reconsider a takeover offer at a later date.  Its all really coming together!  I can't take the credit for ECO, I've mentioned it on RKH message board but I wasn't the first, can't remember who it was now,  Think maybe Malaysia888 might have been one of the original reccommenders?? Anyway, you and I and indeed a good many others are currently doing very well here with WTE and long may it continue for us all! Come on RKH FID.... Best wishes to you Supra and indeed everyone else.

However it's all good if Eco and Navitas take over JHI, then old Argos shareholders are back in the game with a rig coming down to drill Sea Lion late 2026/early 2027, with no doubt down time to pop a well or too in PL001.

RKH had a discovery and a fully appraised one at that, what have JHI got in Agros' old acreage, Johnston Gas discovery encroaching into their acreage and some 3D. Yes, they have a load of prospects to go at, look a likes of Sea Lion, but that's all. RKH had a fully appraised Sea lion, an almost complete EIS and FDP that Navitas needed to update and they still all they got for 65% of the whole acreage was two loans, no cash up front. Even Harbour paid them something like $6m to take Sea Lion off their hands! So, Im' not saying JHI's Argos acreage hasn't got any value, it surely does, but cash upfront and carry on drilling might be a stretch too far. Still something is a foot here and it will be interesting to see how it all fits together with Eco. Maybe as has been mentioned, ECO might take them out with Navitas so Nav gets it's hands on Argos old acreage and tidies things up a bit. Interesting times. LTT",

WTE also has interests outside of Falklands too which I haven\u2019t fully valued in so that effectively makes the current SP even cheaper than it should be.  It was a very simplistic and general valuation. Best regards JPDM",

LOL I have great confidence in WTE  shares rising again soon and making us all a fortune. You may ask will I regret selling a portion. The answer, no, I have never regretted de-risking when the opportunity is ripe. I have several free holdings using this method. Each to their own and the very best of luck to all.",

If  there was indeed  to be a similar deal struck and split for JHI in PL001 then if that similar valuation to Sealion and RKH would value JHI at \u00a3600M for 35% of PL001 then WTE 6.25% of JHI in the PL001 would be \u00a337.5M valuation.  THat excludes all the other assets and investments that WTE have!  So.... \u00a337.5M divided by 144M shares gives my medium/longer term target price of around 26p per share!  There's the maths. Good luck to all Best wishes and Good fortune to all JPDM FM",

I think there are some really exciting times ahead here and also indirectly there is a multitude of potential deals etc that could come together.  Just look at Navitas/RKH right next door,  WTE has the PL001 indirect interest of 6.24% via JHI.  ECO Atlantic also have an interest in JHI and indeed were considering taking them over previously.  Navitas and ECO recent deal and WTE has interests in ECO.  That is all very incestuous!  Plus we have all WTE other interests to take into account too. Watch this space! Very best wishes JPDM",

Thats a nice return, I actually got some at 0.5p at the end of July, some more at circa 1p and the rest more recently cira 2p so average somewhere at the 1p mark so close to 300% return or so.   Short term target of 3.5p reached - just trying to crunch some number but mid term targets for WTE are looking very much to be somewhere north of 12p.  Excluding all other areas they are involved in FID for RKH has surely got to have an impact on the WTE sp and indeed that of ECO. Just re-capping that WTE have 6.24% of JHI who own 100% of PL001 which has at least 800MB's of oil.  All this slap bang next door to RKH and... just for a bit of extra candy we have Navitas now linking up with ECO who have 7% of JHI and previously considered taking over JHI and left the door open to reconsider a takeover offer at a later date.  Its all really coming together!  I can't take the credit for ECO, I've mentioned it on RKH message board but I wasn't the first, can't remember who it was now,  Think maybe Malaysia888 might have been one of the original reccommenders?? Anyway, you and I and indeed a good many others are currently doing very well here with WTE and long may it continue for us all! Come on RKH FID.... Best wishes to you Supra and indeed everyone else.

I wonder what the implications are for taking over JHI, does WTE get a percentage of the new Eco enlarged company? Just some musings. LTT",

However it's all good if Eco and Navitas take over JHI, then old Argos shareholders are back in the game with a rig coming down to drill Sea Lion late 2026/early 2027, with no doubt down time to pop a well or too in PL001. Things are getting very exciting and interesting, something has to give soon. LTT",

RKH had a discovery and a fully appraised one at that, what have JHI got in Agros' old acreage, Johnston Gas discovery encroaching into their acreage and some 3D. Yes, they have a load of prospects to go at, look a likes of Sea Lion, but that's all. RKH had a fully appraised Sea lion, an almost complete EIS and FDP that Navitas needed to update and they still all they got for 65% of the whole acreage was two loans, no cash up front. Even Harbour paid them something like $6m to take Sea Lion off their hands! So, Im' not saying JHI's Argos acreage hasn't got any value, it surely does, but cash upfront and carry on drilling might be a stretch too far. Still something is a foot here and it will be interesting to see how it all fits together with Eco. Maybe as has been mentioned, ECO might take them out with Navitas so Nav gets it's hands on Argos old acreage and tidies things up a bit. Interesting times. LTT",

If  there was indeed  to be a similar deal struck and split for JHI in PL001 then if that similar valuation to Sealion and RKH would value JHI at \u00a3600M for 35% of PL001 then WTE 6.25% of JHI in the PL001 would be \u00a337.5M valuation.  THat excludes all the other assets and investments that WTE have!  So.... \u00a337.5M divided by 144M shares gives my medium/longer term target price of around 26p per share!  There's the maths.

I think there are some really exciting times ahead here and also indirectly there is a multitude of potential deals etc that could come together.  Just look at Navitas/RKH right next door,  WTE has the PL001 indirect interest of 6.24% via JHI.  ECO Atlantic also have an interest in JHI and indeed were considering taking them over previously.  Navitas and ECO recent deal and WTE has interests in ECO.  That is all very incestuous!  Plus we have all WTE other interests to take into account too. Watch this space! Very best wishes JPDM",

          "content": "Supra3 Yep is all looking good!  Thats a nice return, I actually got some at 0.5p at the end of July, some more at circa 1p and the rest more recently cira 2p so average somewhere at the 1p mark so close to 300% return or so.   Short term target of 3.5p reached - just trying to crunch some number but mid term targets for WTE are looking very much to be somewhere north of 12p.  Excluding all other areas they are involved in FID for RKH has surely got to have an impact on the WTE sp and indeed that of ECO. Just re-capping that WTE have 6.24% of JHI who own 100% of PL001 which has at least 800MB's of oil.  All this slap bang next door to RKH and... just for a bit of extra candy we have Navitas now linking up with ECO who have 7% of JHI and previously considered taking over JHI and left the door open to reconsider a takeover offer at a later date.  Its all really coming together!  I can't take the credit for ECO, I've mentioned it on RKH message board but I wasn't the first, can't remember who it was now,  Think maybe Malaysia888 might have been one of the original reccommenders?? Anyway, you and I and indeed a good many others are currently doing very well here with WTE and long may it continue for us all! Come on RKH FID.... Best wishes to you Supra and indeed everyone else.

However it's all good if Eco and Navitas take over JHI, then old Argos shareholders are back in the game with a rig coming down to drill Sea Lion late 2026/early 2027, with no doubt down time to pop a well or too in PL001. Things are getting very exciting and interesting, something has to give soon. LTT",

At that point in time could a valuation of RKH of \u00a3600M been forecast. Time will tell but there is definitely a momentum happening with Falkland related stocks and my money is on what may or could happen right next door to Sealion in PL001.

RKH had a discovery and a fully appraised one at that, what have JHI got in Agros' old acreage, Johnston Gas discovery encroaching into their acreage and some 3D. Yes, they have a load of prospects to go at, look a likes of Sea Lion, but that's all. RKH had a fully appraised Sea lion, an almost complete EIS and FDP that Navitas needed to update and they still all they got for 65% of the whole acreage was two loans, no cash up front. Even Harbour paid them something like $6m to take Sea Lion off their hands! So, Im' not saying JHI's Argos acreage hasn't got any value, it surely does, but cash upfront and carry on drilling might be a stretch too far. Still something is a foot here and it will be interesting to see how it all fits together with Eco. Maybe as has been mentioned, ECO might take them out with Navitas so Nav gets it's hands on Argos old acreage and tidies things up a bit. Interesting times. LTT",

LOL I have great confidence in WTE  shares rising again soon and making us all a fortune. You may ask will I regret selling a portion.

If  there was indeed  to be a similar deal struck and split for JHI in PL001 then if that similar valuation to Sealion and RKH would value JHI at \u00a3600M for 35% of PL001 then WTE 6.25% of JHI in the PL001 would be \u00a337.5M valuation.  THat excludes all the other assets and investments that WTE have!  So.... \u00a337.5M divided by 144M shares gives my medium/longer term target price of around 26p per share!  There's the maths.

I think there are some really exciting times ahead here and also indirectly there is a multitude of potential deals etc that could come together.  Just look at Navitas/RKH right next door,  WTE has the PL001 indirect interest of 6.24% via JHI.  ECO Atlantic also have an interest in JHI and indeed were considering taking them over previously.  Navitas and ECO recent deal and WTE has interests in ECO.  That is all very incestuous!  Plus we have all WTE other interests to take into account too. Watch this space! Very best wishes JPDM",

Thats a nice return, I actually got some at 0.5p at the end of July, some more at circa 1p and the rest more recently cira 2p so average somewhere at the 1p mark so close to 300% return or so.   Short term target of 3.5p reached - just trying to crunch some number but mid term targets for WTE are looking very much to be somewhere north of 12p.  Excluding all other areas they are involved in FID for RKH has surely got to have an impact on the WTE sp and indeed that of ECO. Just re-capping that WTE have 6.24% of JHI who own 100% of PL001 which has at least 800MB's of oil.  All this slap bang next door to RKH and... just for a bit of extra candy we have Navitas now linking up with ECO who have 7% of JHI and previously considered taking over JHI and left the door open to reconsider a takeover offer at a later date.  Its all really coming together!  I can't take the credit for ECO, I've mentioned it on RKH message board but I wasn't the first, can't remember who it was now,  Think maybe Malaysia888 might have been one of the original reccommenders?? Anyway, you and I and indeed a good many others are currently doing very well here with WTE and long may it continue for us all! Come on RKH FID.... Best wishes to you Supra and indeed everyone else.

Eg.  Would JHI float?  Get taken over and if so then what valuation do you pin on JHI.  Maybe the route would be a float by JHI. Creates even more musings!!! Best wishes JPDM",

However it's all good if Eco and Navitas take over JHI, then old Argos shareholders are back in the game with a rig coming down to drill Sea Lion late 2026/early 2027, with no doubt down time to pop a well or too in PL001.

RKH had a discovery and a fully appraised one at that, what have JHI got in Agros' old acreage, Johnston Gas discovery encroaching into their acreage and some 3D. Yes, they have a load of prospects to go at, look a likes of Sea Lion, but that's all. RKH had a fully appraised Sea lion, an almost complete EIS and FDP that Navitas needed to update and they still all they got for 65% of the whole acreage was two loans, no cash up front. Even Harbour paid them something like $6m to take Sea Lion off their hands! So, Im' not saying JHI's Argos acreage hasn't got any value, it surely does, but cash upfront and carry on drilling might be a stretch too far. Still something is a foot here and it will be interesting to see how it all fits together with Eco. Maybe as has been mentioned, ECO might take them out with Navitas so Nav gets it's hands on Argos old acreage and tidies things up a bit. Interesting times. LTT",

If  there was indeed  to be a similar deal struck and split for JHI in PL001 then if that similar valuation to Sealion and RKH would value JHI at \u00a3600M for 35% of PL001 then WTE 6.25% of JHI in the PL001 would be \u00a337.5M valuation.  THat excludes all the other assets and investments that WTE have!  So.... \u00a337.5M divided by 144M shares gives my medium/longer term target price of around 26p per share!  There's the maths.

I think there are some really exciting times ahead here and also indirectly there is a multitude of potential deals etc that could come together.  Just look at Navitas/RKH right next door,  WTE has the PL001 indirect interest of 6.24% via JHI.  ECO Atlantic also have an interest in JHI and indeed were considering taking them over previously.  Navitas and ECO recent deal and WTE has interests in ECO.  That is all very incestuous!  Plus we have all WTE other interests to take into account too. Watch this space! Very best wishes JPDM",

Thats a nice return, I actually got some at 0.5p at the end of July, some more at circa 1p and the rest more recently cira 2p so average somewhere at the 1p mark so close to 300% return or so.   Short term target of 3.5p reached - just trying to crunch some number but mid term targets for WTE are looking very much to be somewhere north of 12p.  Excluding all other areas they are involved in FID for RKH has surely got to have an impact on the WTE sp and indeed that of ECO. Just re-capping that WTE have 6.24% of JHI who own 100% of PL001 which has at least 800MB's of oil.  All this slap bang next door to RKH and... just for a bit of extra candy we have Navitas now linking up with ECO who have 7% of JHI and previously considered taking over JHI and left the door open to reconsider a takeover offer at a later date.  Its all really coming together!  I can't take the credit for ECO, I've mentioned it on RKH message board but I wasn't the first, can't remember who it was now,  Think maybe Malaysia888 might have been one of the original reccommenders?? Anyway, you and I and indeed a good many others are currently doing very well here with WTE and long may it continue for us all! Come on RKH FID.... Best wishes to you Supra and indeed everyone else.

However it's all good if Eco and Navitas take over JHI, then old Argos shareholders are back in the game with a rig coming down to drill Sea Lion late 2026/early 2027, with no doubt down time to pop a well or too in PL001. Things are getting very exciting and interesting, something has to give soon. LTT",

At that point in time could a valuation of RKH of \u00a3600M been forecast. Time will tell but there is definitely a momentum happening with Falkland related stocks and my money is on what may or could happen right next door to Sealion in PL001.

RKH had a discovery and a fully appraised one at that, what have JHI got in Agros' old acreage, Johnston Gas discovery encroaching into their acreage and some 3D. Yes, they have a load of prospects to go at, look a likes of Sea Lion, but that's all. RKH had a fully appraised Sea lion, an almost complete EIS and FDP that Navitas needed to update and they still all they got for 65% of the whole acreage was two loans, no cash up front. Even Harbour paid them something like $6m to take Sea Lion off their hands! So, Im' not saying JHI's Argos acreage hasn't got any value, it surely does, but cash upfront and carry on drilling might be a stretch too far. Still something is a foot here and it will be interesting to see how it all fits together with Eco. Maybe as has been mentioned, ECO might take them out with Navitas so Nav gets it's hands on Argos old acreage and tidies things up a bit. Interesting times. LTT",
