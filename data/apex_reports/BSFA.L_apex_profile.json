This unique method creates 100% real leather without synthetic additives of 'scaffolds', ensuring unparalleled quality. Recently, the company delivered additional samples for a major global luxury goods company's development programme and is preparing to supply samples to a luxury automotive manufacturer. Notably, three of the five most valuable luxury brands are now engaged in development programmes with us.\n\u00b7\n3D Bio Tissues:\nFollowing the update in September, 3DBT successfully commenced the soft launch of its new CytoBoostTM media additive, receiving significant interest from multiple biopharma companies, research facilities and biotech SMEs. Feedback from initial partners in our \"Research with Us\" program has been overwhelmingly positive, having seen improvements in their cell growth characteristics. In particular, the use of CytoBoostTM in reviving cells following thaw from cryostorage has been well received. The use of City MixTM continues to expand in terms of repeat orders and successful cell types tested and being used by third parties. A Korean cultivated meat company has successfully completed its second round of testing and is now moving forward with the production of its cells into larger bioreactors. Meanwhile, City-mixTM is now in the latter stages of a tech transfer assessment by a leading UK-based cultivated meat company to be a key component in their in-house reduced-cost media formulation.\n\u00b7\nCultivated Meat Technologies (CMT):\nThe Company has made the decision not to pursue the proposed Joint Venture partnership with CellulaRevolution Ltd (CellRev) and will seek alternative avenues for establishing cultivated meat products with major UK and European food processors, producers and retailers. To accelerate this process, we are in discussions with established upstream technology providers. This decision has helped the Group redirect necessary funds to focus more on near-term potential business revenues, to align technology needs across multiple tissue-engineered product processes, and to allow us to achieve numerous additional commercial milestones for LGL and Kerato Limited planned between now and Q2 2025. As a result of this update, BSF continues to own 100% of CMT.\n\u00b7\nKerato Ltd:\nKerato has been working with veterinary ophthalmologist Dr Maria Vanore from the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al and her team to achieve regulatory approvals to commence veterinary trials in Q1 2025 for its LiQD Cornea device. Established to provide novel solutions for the treatment of corneal tissue damage, the injectable LiQD Cornea forms a self-sealing gel upon contact with corneal tissue that suppresses inflammation and facilitates damage repair through the remodelling of healthy tissue. LiQD Cornea inventor and Kerato advisor, Professor May Griffith, has received positive feedback on our prototype devices and clinical trials (scheduled to start in 2026) from numerous internationally leading ophthalmologists at the recent international Tear Film and Ocular Surface conference, Venice.\n\u25cf\nCorporate:\nThe Company is pleased to announce that it is allotting 312,500 ordinary shares, in lieu of a proportion of professional fees, to investment podcast firm PR Roast. The ordinary shares have been issued at 4 pence per share, representing a premium to the current share price.\nChe Connon, Managing Director of BSF Enterprise and CEO of 3DBT, commented:\n\"We are making strong progress, focusing our activities on several near-term commercial opportunities across a range of disciplines within our business. This has led to discussions of increasing quality with a growing number of potential customers. We are confident these discussions will develop further into the coming year and look forward to sharing our progress in this respect in future updates.\"\nFor further enquiries, please visit www.bsfenterprise.com or contact:\nBSF Enterprise PLC\nVia SEC Newgate below\nGeoff Baker - Executive Director\nChe Connon - CEO & Director\nShard Capital (Broker)\nDamon Heath\nIsabella Pierre\n0207 186 9000\n0207 186 9927\nSEC Newgate (Financial Communications)\nBob Huxford\nElisabeth Cowell\nGeorge Esmond\n020 3757 6882\nBSF@secnewgate.co.uk\nAbout BSF Enterprise PLC\nBSF Enterprise PLC (BSF) is the parent to a portfolio of innovative subsidiary companies focused on developing and commercialising cell-based tissue engineering solutions to deliver sustainable outcomes across a variety of sectors.

Today BSF is delighted to announce it has entered into a commercial agreement with Ivy Farm that will involve generating and progressing investment opportunities to support the company's fundraising ambitions. BSF subsidiary company 3DBT is also working with Ivy Farm to test its City Mix\n?\nserum-free media within its products with the goal of reducing the cost of cultivated meat production in the Asian market.\nIvy Farm was spun out from the University of Oxford in 2019 and its unique technology produces nutritious mincemeat from premium Wagyu Beef, Aberdeen Angus, and English Large White Pork tissue to create delicious final products such as meatballs, scotch eggs and burgers. In 2022, Ivy Farm unveiled a pilot plant in Oxford with production capabilities of 2.8 tonnes of cultivated meat a year, all powered by solar, the largest of its kind in Europe.\nBSF will be supporting Ivy Farm's ongoing funding round, aimed at facilitating the scaling up of technology to accommodate large production-sized fermenters. In the future Ivy Farm envisions producing 12,000 tonnes from a single efficient facility, fully powered by renewable energy, thereby slashing greenhouses gases by 92% and land use by 90% compared to industrial farming practices. The production of cultivated meat at scale is critical, especially considering China's annual consumption of over 100 million tons of meat, which constitutes more than a quarter of global meat consumption.\nProfessor Cathy Ye, Co-Founder of Ivy Farm and Director at the Oxford Centre for Tissue Engineering and Bioprocessing (OCTEB),\nexpressed her enthusiasm about the partnership, emphasizing her personal connection to China where she was raised and earned her Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering from Dalian University of Technology. She highlighted the significant potential for sustainable food security in the region that can be enables by the unique cell lines and technology created at Ivy Farm.\nChe Connon, Managing Director of BSF Enterprise and CEO of 3DBT, commented\n:\n\"Today's announcement represents the start of a strong commercial and technical working relationship between BSF Enterprise and Ivy Farm. The cultivated meat market is front and centre for China in\nits blueprint for food security as part of its five-year agricultural plan. We look forward to helping Ivy Farm enter the China market through securing investment and working with key manufacturers to develop a variety of cultivated meat products that can serve a significant, growing market.\"\nFor further enquiries, please visit\nwww.bsfenterprise.com\nor contact:\nNotes to Editors\nAbout BSF Enterprise PLC:\n?\nBSF Enterprise PLC (BSF) is focused on unlocking the next generation of biotechnological solutions - using cell-based tissue engineering to help generate cultured meat, lab-grown leather, as well as human corneas, collagen growth and skin substitutes, as part of a radical transformation to deliver sustainable solutions across a variety of sectors.\nIt owns 100% of 3D Bio-Tissues (3DBT), a tissue engineering with patent-protected IP that is already producing human corneas for testing to help restore vision to millions of people.
