Axelys, mandated by the Government of Qu\n\u00e9\nbec to administer PSO V2D, supports the project throughout the entire innovation valorization process, from research to responsible commercialization, ensuring that intellectual property is appropriately structured and transferred in alignment with Qu\n\u00e9\nbec\n'\ns innovation objectives.\nThe grant has a total value of CAD 663,000, with costs shared between Kerato and the Qu\n\u00e9\nbec Ministry of Economy, Innovation and Energy. Kerato will co-fund approximately 55% of the programme costs over the 18-month project duration.\nUse of Grant Funding and Programme Scope\nThe PSO programme will support a defined programme of work aimed at advancing the veterinary commercialization of LiQD Cornea while reducing risks associated with future human clinical development. Funded activities will include safety and biocompatibility testing, veterinary clinical trials conducted at the University of Montreal under the leadership of Dr Maria Vanore, as well as regulatory and intellectual property support. The program will also provide dedicated research resources focused on manufacturing development, quality readiness, and regulatory documentation, supporting technology transfer, manufacturing scale-up, and commercial readiness.\nProgramme Outcomes and Timelines\nThe programme will support:\n\u25cf\nCommencement of veterinary clinical trials in Q1 2026, generating safety and performance data required for market entry of LiQD Cornea Animal Health;\n\u25cf\nManufacturing scale-up and Quality readiness, including technical documentation and controlled production processes;\n\u25cf\nRegulatory preparedness for North American markets, including early engagement with regulators; and\n\u25cf\nDe-risking of Kerato\n'\ns human clinical development programme through completion of safety and biocompatibility datasets and early regulatory pathway definition.\nSubject to successful completion of veterinary clinical trials and regulatory requirements, Kerato is targeting initial commercial launch of LiQD Cornea Animal Health in Canada in Q1 2027, with first revenues anticipated thereafter.\nThe project team has already commenced preparatory activities for engagement with Health Canada, supported by regulatory consultants, to define regulatory pathways for both veterinary and human clinical development.\nStrategic Impact\nThis ongoing collaboration with the University of Montreal strengthens Kerato\n'\ns North American presence and provides access to leading veterinary and translational research expertise, supporting Kerato\n'\ns strategy to access high-value veterinary and clinical markets in North America. Early revenues from the Animal Health product launch in 2027 are expected to support ongoing clinical development and regulatory preparation for human applications.\nSarah Greenhalgh, Co-Founder and CEO commented\n:\n\"\nThis PSO award is a major step forward for Kerato. It allows us to move confidently into veterinary clinical trials, prepare for market launch of LiQD Cornea Animal, and, critically, begin de-risking our human clinical programme.\nWorking with the University of Montreal and engaging early with Health Canada positions us strongly for North American market access and supports our long-term ambition to deliver scalable, regenerative solutions for corneal repair across both animal and human health.\"\nProfessor May Griffith, Inventor and Lead Scientist, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital Research Centre and Universit\n\u00e9\nde Montr\n\u00e9\nal commented\n:\n\"\nThis PSO programme provides an important opportunity to translate our corneal tissue engineering research into real-world clinical and commercial applications. Working in close partnership with Kerato allows us to combine deep scientific expertise with a clear pathway to market. Together, we aim to generate robust veterinary data while advancing the safety, manufacturing, and regulatory foundations needed to support future human clinical development.\"\n\"\nThis collaboration reflects the strength of Qu\n\u00e9\nbec\n'\ns innovation ecosystem and the role it can play to deepen ties with like-minded markets. With the support of the Government of Qu\n\u00e9\nbec, leading institutions such as the University of Montreal are working closely with industry partners to deploy high-potential research. Axelys supports this project throughout the full innovation valorization process, from research, properly structuring the IP to transferring it for commercialization, showcasing Qu\n\u00e9\nbec\n'\ns scientific excellence and know-how on the international stage\". - Jesse Vincent-Herscovici, President and CEO, Axelys\nEngage with the BSF Enterprise management team directly by asking questions, watching video\nsummaries and seeing what other shareholders have to say.

Founded in 2019, SeaWith is a South Korean biotechnology innovator employing seaweed-derived technologies to produce sustainable, slaughter-free meat alternatives. The company has raised over\u00a0$8 million\u00a0in venture funding to date. Its flagship product line, Welldone\u2122, focuses on cultivated beef and other meat alternatives designed for scalability and environmental impact reduction.\nThe value of the agreement\u00a0to 3DBT is around \u00a3300K. Under the agreement, SeaWith will be sent a regular supply of City-Mix to support its cultivated-meat production pipeline, representing a key milestone in expanding the product's reach into the cultivated-protein market.\nCity-Mix\u00ae is designed to improve cell density, growth efficiency, and tissue quality, while significantly lowering production costs by reducing the amount of expensive growth media required for SeaWith by around 30 per cent.\nThe global cultivated meat sector is gaining momentum, and South Korea is emerging as one of Asia's most promising markets, supported by government-backed initiatives such as the Regulatory-Free Special Zone (RFSZ). This zone allows companies like SeaWith to bypass certain red-tape regulatory hurdles for five years, enabling faster commercialisation of cultivated meat products. The RFSZ is part of a broader national strategy to make South Korea a global hub for food-tech, creating an environment for scaling production and achieving price parity with conventional meat.\nThe country's alternative protein market is projected to grow at over 50% CAGR by 2030, driven by food security concerns, environmental sustainability, and rising demand for cultivated meat production. Overall, 90% of South Koreans are willing to try cultivated meat, but price and taste remain key drivers. Government investment and regulatory flexibility are expected to help overcome these barriers, making South Korea one of Asia's most promising markets for cultivated protein.\nChe Connon, CEO of 3D Bio-Tissues, said:\n\"This agreement marks a significant milestone for 3D Bio-Tissues as we expand City-Mix\u00ae into one of Asia's most dynamic cultivated meat markets. By partnering with SeaWith, a recognised innovator in sustainable protein, we are demonstrating how our technology can deliver real commercial impact, boosting cell yield, improving tissue quality, and crucially lowering production costs to help make cultivated meat economically viable at scale. We see this collaboration as a strong validation of City-Mix\u00ae and an important step toward accelerating global adoption of cultivated meat.\"\nHeejae Lee, CTO and Co-founder of SeaWith said:\n\"As Korea's designated Regulatory Free Zone operator for cultivated meat, we are pleased to partner with an industry leader like 3D Bio-Tissues as we move toward regulatory approval.
