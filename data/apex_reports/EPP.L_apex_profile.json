This represents an almost fourfold increase in the area EnergyPathways is targeting for salt cavern development.\nThe Company intends to submit an application to the Secretary of State for a Development Consent Order (DCO) for the other elements of the MESH project.\nBen Clube, CEO of EnergyPathways, said:\n\"We are delighted to have formally submitted a natural gas and hydrogen storage licence application for MESH. Following the positive endorsement of MESH by the Secretary of State as a development of national significance, we are hopeful of receiving a decision on this application soon.\n\"If successful with its application, EnergyPathways plans to progress a hydrogen storage and transportation project which will be integrated with its 90 MW methane pyrolysis hydrogen production facility being developed in conjunction with KBR and Hazer*. The planned hydrogen storage will be able to supply the Company's hydrogen-to-power system being developed with Siemens Energy**.\n\"The Company also plans to develop natural gas storage to help shore up the UK's security of energy supply. The UK has meagre existing gas storage capacity. The Company considers this licence area, and the Irish Sea region more broadly, as having significant potential for large-scale economic development of natural gas storage.\n\"We look forward to updating the market in due course.\"\n*\nKBR Inc. and Hazer Limited\n** Siemens Energy Global GmbH & Co. KG\nAbout MESH\nMESH will be a new, large scale, energy storage and decarbonisation facility that is expected to provide a secure and dependable supply of affordable low-carbon energy for the UK market for over 25 years.\nThe MESH integrated energy system solution comprises; large-scale Long Duration Energy Storage (\"LDES\"), flexible low-carbon power capacity and low-carbon hydrogen and graphite production with the potential to branch into low-carbon ammonia production. MESH will connect its LDES integrated storage system using existing infrastructure to the UK grid and nearby offshore wind capacity to help harness value from some of the billions of pounds of the UK's wasted wind power.\nThe MESH system is designed to capture and store curtailed offshore wind power in offshore salt caverns as compressed air. The MESH energy storage system combines associated large-scale hydrogen, thermal and natural gas storage capacity in geo-storage features (the salt caverns). During periods of low renewable energy availability, the LDES stored energy resources will be utilised to generate low-carbon flexible power for the UK's grid via compressed air expansion, thermal energy and hydrogen-compatible gas turbine systems to generate electricity.\nThe MESH facility will also produce affordable low-carbon hydrogen using methane pyrolysis technology for which EnergyPathways has exclusive rights of use within the UK. The hydrogen can be used to further decarbonise the MESH flexible power generation system using its hydrogen compatible gas turbine system. The by-product of the MESH hydrogen production facility is a high-grade form of synthetic graphite.\nIn addition to supplying dispatchable low-carbon electricity to the grid, MESH-produced hydrogen can support the UK's emerging Project Union hydrogen network, contributing to broader emissions reductions across the energy system.\nThe MESH project is targeted to be operational by 2030, subject to government approvals and financing, in order to contribute to the Government's 2030 Clean Power ambitions. EnergyPathways aims to play its role in supporting the Government in accelerating the UK's energy transition.\nInvestor Engagement with EnergyPathways\nEngage with us by asking questions, watching video summaries and seeing what other shareholders have to say.

The aim is to design a modular and scalable system.\nThe partnership will initially target opportunities to support the UK's clean power and energy security goals, beginning with EnergyPathways' planned MESH project's LDES and flexible low carbon power system, in the East Irish Sea and Cumbria.\nThe Agreement is non-binding and sets out the basis for entering into formal long-term or partnership contracts that would be concluded in due course.\nBen Clube, CEO of EnergyPathways, said:\n\"This cooperation agreement with Siemens Energy demonstrates our commitment to partnering with world leaders in clean energy technology and engineering.\n\"The Agreement positions the Company as a leader in the development of LDES with multi-day power supply which can harness wasted renewable power at scale. Affordable multi-day LDES is the missing piece of the puzzle that can deliver affordable and reliable power supply within renewables dominated grids.\"\n\"In partnership with Siemens Energy, we aim to design and develop a modular multi-day LDES system that can be scaled and deployed around the world. This has the potential to make renewables dominated grid systems more affordable for consumers and taxpayers.\n\"Our MESH project is planned as the first to be delivered under this Agreement.\"\nAbout Siemens Energy\nSiemens Energy is a global leader in energy technology, driving the transition to a more sustainable world by developing innovative systems for power generation, transmission, and storage. With a comprehensive portfolio spanning conventional and renewable technologies, the company operates in over 90 countries with around 103,000 employees and generated \u20ac39.1 billion in revenue in fiscal year 2025.\nAbout MESH\nMESH will be a new, large scale, energy storage and decarbonisation facility that is expected to provide a secure and dependable supply of affordable low-carbon energy for the UK market for over 25 years.\nThe MESH integrated energy system solution comprises; large-scale Long Duration Energy Storage (\"LDES\"), flexible low-carbon power capacity and low-carbon hydrogen and graphite production with the potential to branch into low-carbon ammonia production. MESH will connect its LDES integrated storage system using existing infrastructure to the UK grid and nearby offshore wind capacity to help harness value from some of the billions of pounds of the UK's wasted wind power.\nThe MESH system is designed to capture and store curtailed offshore wind power in offshore salt caverns as compressed air. The MESH energy storage system combines associated large-scale hydrogen, thermal and natural gas storage capacity in geo-storage features (the salt caverns). During periods of low renewable energy availability, the LDES stored energy resources will be utilised to generate low-carbon flexible power for the UK's grid via compressed air expansion, thermal energy and hydrogen-compatible gas turbine systems to generate electricity.\nThe MESH facility will also produce affordable low-carbon hydrogen using methane pyrolysis technology for which EnergyPathways has exclusive rights of use within the UK. The hydrogen can be used to further decarbonise the MESH flexible power generation system using its hydrogen compatible gas turbine system. The by-product of the MESH hydrogen production facility is a high-grade form of synthetic graphite.\nIn addition to supplying dispatchable low-carbon electricity to the grid, MESH-produced hydrogen can support the UK's emerging Project Union hydrogen network, contributing to broader emissions reductions across the energy system.\nThe MESH project is targeted to be operational by 2030, subject to government approvals and financing, in order to contribute to the Government's 2030 Clean Power ambitions. EnergyPathways aims to play its role in supporting the Government in accelerating the UK's energy transition.\nInvestor Engagement with EnergyPathways\nEngage with us by asking questions, watching video summaries and seeing what other shareholders have to say.

      "why_they_matter": "With the UK\u2019s net\u2011zero push, modular storage is a critical infrastructure gap, and a first\u2011mover advantage could open a \u00a35\u201110bn market.",
      "current_state": "The company is pre\u2011revenue, still raising capital and chasing regulatory approvals, with a high\u2011risk, high\u2011potential profile."

      "rns_narrative": [
        "Fundraising and Valuation: In October, EPP.L announced a \u00a31.238m placement and an additional fundraise, setting a new valuation that places the shares at a discount to the market. The placement price was 10p, roughly 20% below recent trading levels, signalling a bullish attempt to shore up capital.",
        "Contract and Partnership Momentum: The company has secured a series of strategic agreements, notably with Siemens Energy and KBR/Hazer, to develop a national\u2011significance hydrogen storage project (MESH). The latest filing confirms a licence application and a Memorandum of Understanding for clean hydrogen development, hinting at a potential revenue engine once the project moves to execution.",
        "Regulatory and Governance Updates: Recent RNS items include the filing of a Total Voting Rights amendment and a new AGM result, both of which are typical corporate housekeeping. No material operational or financial disclosures were made, leaving investors with a largely speculative view of the company\u2019s trajectory."
      ],
      "crowd_tape": {
        "dominant_theme": "The community remains largely silent; the lack of posts suggests uncertainty or a lack of confidence in the story.",
        "bull_narrative": "Bulls point to the MESH partnership and the national\u2011significance designation as evidence of a breakthrough that could unlock future revenue streams, arguing that the company is positioned to benefit from the UK\u2019s hydrogen push.",
        "bear_narrative": "Bears warn that the company has no revenue history, a flat Google\u2011Trends profile, and a zero\u2011volatility technical picture, arguing that the story is over\u2011hyped and the market price reflects a speculative bubble.",
        "sentiment_shift": "There was a faint spike in discussion when the Siemens Energy agreement was announced, but the chatter faded within a week and has not rebounded."
      },
      "attention_check": "Google Trends shows a flat interest curve with an 0/100 score, and social media volume remains at zero. The story has not captured public attention and is likely losing oxygen."
    },
    "expect_next": {
      "near_term_catalysts": [
        "Regulatory Approval: The next key event is the final approval of the MESH licence, expected within the next 30\u201345 days. A green light would validate the project pipeline and could prompt a price rally.",
        "Capital Call or Placement: EPP.L may announce a follow\u2011up capital raise to fund the MESH project. If the new placement is priced at or below the current level, it could create a buying opportunity for those looking to add at a discount."
      ],
      "watch_for": "Monitor for any director share sales or PDMR filings; such activity could signal insider doubts and erode confidence in the company\u2019s long\u2011term prospects.",
      "timing_regime": "APEX marks the stock as an \u2018Exhausted\u2019 early\u2011stage play\u2014technical indicators suggest the current price is a low point, but the narrative has yet to deliver a clear catalyst."
    },
    "buy_vs_sell": {
      "lean": "Bearish",
      "bull_case": "The bullish thesis hinges on the successful execution of the MESH project, which could unlock a \u00a32\u20133bn revenue stream if the UK government\u2019s hydrogen strategy delivers on its promises. A clean\u2011hydrogen partnership with Siemens Energy and a national\u2011significance licence would provide a credible path to revenue, making a price jump plausible if the project moves from paper to reality.",
      "bear_case": "The company has no revenue history, a flat technical profile, and zero social media traction. The recent fundraises were conducted at a discount, indicating limited investor confidence. Without a concrete revenue milestone or regulatory approval, the stock remains a speculative bet that could be wiped out by a single negative development.",
      "risk_reward": "High risk with a potential 3\u20115x upside if the MESH project materialises, but the downside is equally steep due to the lack of any tangible revenue or proven product."
    },
    "playbook": {
      "if_bullish": "If you decide to take a speculative position, start with a tiny 1\u20132% allocation, set a tight stop at 8p (just below the latest placement price), and only add if a regulatory approval or a clear revenue announcement is made.",
      "if_watching": "Hold off until the MESH licence is officially approved or a clean\u2011hydrogen partnership yields a revenue projection. If either event occurs, consider a small entry on a dip, but remain vigilant for any insider selling signals.",
      "if_passing": "Given the absence of social buzz, flat Google\u2011Trends data, and zero volatility, staying out is prudent. The story is currently a speculative narrative with no clear path to earnings, making it a risky play that could underperform the broader market."
    },
    "bottom_line": "Speculative short\u2011term play with high upside if the MESH project receives regulatory approval, but the lack of revenue, flat technicals, and zero market interest make it a risky bet\u2014best approached with caution or avoided altogether.",
