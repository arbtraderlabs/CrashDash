This represents an almost fourfold increase in the area EnergyPathways is targeting for salt cavern development.\nThe Company intends to submit an application to the Secretary of State for a Development Consent Order (DCO) for the other elements of the MESH project.\nBen Clube, CEO of EnergyPathways, said:\n\"We are delighted to have formally submitted a natural gas and hydrogen storage licence application for MESH. Following the positive endorsement of MESH by the Secretary of State as a development of national significance, we are hopeful of receiving a decision on this application soon.\n\"If successful with its application, EnergyPathways plans to progress a hydrogen storage and transportation project which will be integrated with its 90 MW methane pyrolysis hydrogen production facility being developed in conjunction with KBR and Hazer*. The planned hydrogen storage will be able to supply the Company's hydrogen-to-power system being developed with Siemens Energy**.\n\"The Company also plans to develop natural gas storage to help shore up the UK's security of energy supply. The UK has meagre existing gas storage capacity. The Company considers this licence area, and the Irish Sea region more broadly, as having significant potential for large-scale economic development of natural gas storage.\n\"We look forward to updating the market in due course.\"\n*\nKBR Inc. and Hazer Limited\n** Siemens Energy Global GmbH & Co. KG\nAbout MESH\nMESH will be a new, large scale, energy storage and decarbonisation facility that is expected to provide a secure and dependable supply of affordable low-carbon energy for the UK market for over 25 years.\nThe MESH integrated energy system solution comprises; large-scale Long Duration Energy Storage (\"LDES\"), flexible low-carbon power capacity and low-carbon hydrogen and graphite production with the potential to branch into low-carbon ammonia production. MESH will connect its LDES integrated storage system using existing infrastructure to the UK grid and nearby offshore wind capacity to help harness value from some of the billions of pounds of the UK's wasted wind power.\nThe MESH system is designed to capture and store curtailed offshore wind power in offshore salt caverns as compressed air. The MESH energy storage system combines associated large-scale hydrogen, thermal and natural gas storage capacity in geo-storage features (the salt caverns). During periods of low renewable energy availability, the LDES stored energy resources will be utilised to generate low-carbon flexible power for the UK's grid via compressed air expansion, thermal energy and hydrogen-compatible gas turbine systems to generate electricity.\nThe MESH facility will also produce affordable low-carbon hydrogen using methane pyrolysis technology for which EnergyPathways has exclusive rights of use within the UK. The hydrogen can be used to further decarbonise the MESH flexible power generation system using its hydrogen compatible gas turbine system. The by-product of the MESH hydrogen production facility is a high-grade form of synthetic graphite.\nIn addition to supplying dispatchable low-carbon electricity to the grid, MESH-produced hydrogen can support the UK's emerging Project Union hydrogen network, contributing to broader emissions reductions across the energy system.\nThe MESH project is targeted to be operational by 2030, subject to government approvals and financing, in order to contribute to the Government's 2030 Clean Power ambitions. EnergyPathways aims to play its role in supporting the Government in accelerating the UK's energy transition.\nInvestor Engagement with EnergyPathways\nEngage with us by asking questions, watching video summaries and seeing what other shareholders have to say.

The Warrants have an exercise price of 9 pence and will expire 2 years after the date of the Fundraise Shares' admission to trading on AIM. The Warrants have an exercise accelerator clause, requiring the Warrant holder to either exercise or lose the Warrants should the price of the Company's Ordinary Shares exceed 12 pence (on a 10-day VWAP basis) over a 30-day period.\nThe proceeds from the Fundraise will be used to fund pre-development activities on the Company's flagship MESH project (\"MESH\"). As announced by the Company on 29 September 2025 (see link below), the Rt Hon, Ed Miliband, the UK's Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero, recently formally directed that the major elements of MESH be treated as a development of national significance requiring development consent under the Planning Act 2008. The specific pre-development activities to be funded include technical and commercial studies for the MESH Long Duration Energy Storage (LDES) and low carbon flexible power system, large scale low carbon hydrogen production, graphite production, hydrogen storage and gas storage and extraction.\nMESH confirmed as project of national significance - 07:00:17 29 Sep 2025 - EPP News article | London Stock Exchange\nThe Directors consider that the Fundraise provides the Company with sufficient funding to allow it to continue to develop the MESH project whilst it advances conversations in respect of long-term cornerstone finance.\nIn connection with the Fundraise, the Company has agreed to issue 636,000 new ordinary shares in respect of commission payable in respect of assistance with arranging the Placing (\"Commission Shares\"). 396,000 of the Commission Shares will also Warrants attached on the basis of one warrant for every two Commission Shares.\nThe Fundraise is conditional on the Fundraise Shares, which will be issued credited as fully paid and will rank pari passu in all respects with the existing Ordinary Shares, being admitted to trading on AIM (\"Admission\"). Admission of the Fundraise Shares and the Commission Shares is expected to occur on or around 27 October 2025.\nTotal voting rights\nImmediately following Admission, the Company will have 220,954,743 Ordinary Shares in issue. Accordingly, the total number of Ordinary Shares in the Company with voting rights will be 220,954,743. This figure may be used by shareholders in the Company as denominator for the calculations by which they may determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the Company under the Financial Conduct Authority's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nCommenting on the Fundraise, CEO Ben Clube said:\n\"With this Fundraise, EnergyPathways is issuing a modest number of new ordinary shares principally to a select number of pre-existing long-term investors who are aligned with the Company's long-term vision and business model. We are pleased to be strengthening the Company's register by increasing the proportion of shares held by its long-term investors.\n\"The Fundraise provides funds for the Company to progress its flagship MESH project that has recently been recognised by the UK Government as having national significance.\nThere is growing appreciation across separate arms of Government of the national benefits that the MESH project can bring. Currently, billions of pounds are being wasted each year on unused wind power and this cost is set to grow rapidly. MESH has the potential to reduce these costs significantly. It would also provide the UK with an affordable source of low-carbon hydrogen production at scale and make the Company an early mover in the production of synthetic graphite, which is recognised as a critical mineral, being a raw material that will be indispensable for the UK and Europe's green transition and defence industry. Furthermore, MESH offers an affordable large-scale gas storage facility ready to strengthen the UK's energy security.\n\"Events continue to bring into sharp focus for the political class the importance of energy solutions that can reduce the burden of high energy bills on consumers while driving forward the transition to clean ener",

This technology system could help to decarbonise Britain's gas supply with no emissions and will help to unlock a sustainable clean energy future for North Sea undeveloped gas reserves currently overlooked due to emission concerns;\n\u00b7\nNext-Generation British Industries: production of high-purity synthetic graphite, a critical mineral in a growing global market for battery applications, and the production of low-carbon ammonia (the UK currently depends for its ammonia supply almost entirely on high emission and costly imports); and\n\u00b7\nLarge-scale gas storage: subject to the necessary authorisations under the Petroleum Act 1998 and Energy Act 2008, the MESH project will also provide large-scale gas storage that can strengthen the UK's future energy security in an increasingly uncertain geo-political world. MESH gas storage is expected to be equivalent in size to Centrica's Rough gas storage facility - the UK's current largest facility and in the opinion of the directors of the Company, MESH offers a lower cost gas storage development option in comparison to other proposals.\nStrong Industry Partnerships\nEnergyPathways is advancing MESH in collaboration with leading global energy and infrastructure partners, including Siemens Energy, Wood plc, Costain plc, KBR Inc, and Hazer Group.\nWith the project's nationally significant status confirmed, EnergyPathways will now progress the MESH project towards a Development Consent Order, positioning it as a transformational UK energy hub and a flagship clean growth project of national significance.\nCopies of the Secretary of State's direction and EnergyPathways' request can be found at\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/marram-energy-storage-and-decarbonisation-hub-project-mesh-section-35-direction-planning-act-2008\n.\nBen Clube, EnergyPathways' CEO commented:\n\"The Secretary of State's decision is a landmark moment for EnergyPathways and for the UK's energy transition. By granting the MESH project nationally significant status, the Government has recognised its potential to become a cornerstone of the UK's clean energy future.\n\"MESH is designed to tackle some of the biggest challenges facing the UK energy system today - the high cost of wasted wind power, heavy reliance on aging high emission and expensive gas power plants and ensuring reliable and secure energy supply in an uncertain geo-political world. With its significant storage capacity, flexible clean power, low-cost hydrogen and supporting new low-carbon industries, MESH can become a catalyst for investment and growth in the UK's economy delivering long-term value not only to EnergyPathways' shareholders, but also to Britain's consumers.\n\"The MESH project's \"whole system\" approach is critical to delivering synergies that support a clean energy future for Britain while helping reduce the burden of subsidy costs being passed on to UK consumers.\n\"Together with our world-class partners, we are now moving forward at pace towards development consent. We believe MESH has the potential to become one of the UK's most important energy hubs, a flagship project of global significance with the p",

MESH is designed to be a decarbonised, fully electrified storage facility that can supply natural gas and green hydrogen to the UK market, at scale. The Company is developing the MESH project so that it is wholly in line with the UK government's energy policy and ambitions, to deliver both Energy Security and Net Zero.\nChairman's Statement\nI am pleased to provide the following statement to frame strategic progress through the first half of the financial year and outline EnergyPathways' priorities and areas of focus for the remainder of the year. It has indeed been a very eventful period, both in terms of activities at the Company as well as wider macro events which, in our view, only serve to enhance the relevance and necessity for MESH.\nA new 'new' world\nThe world is undoubtedly going through another shift in the global rhetoric regarding energy industries and this is again causing the sands to shift in terms of global policies around energy transition and security. The impact of this shift in tone regarding the pace and structure of what a responsible energy transition should look like - and how it can delivered logistically and financially - has resulted in a change of strategy by the Majors who are key players in plugging the investment and skills gaps to deliver the ambitious global decarbonisation targets.\nWith Majors scaling back their renewables ambitions and capital becoming harder to access for \"renew",

This affects only the natural gas storage and hydrogen storage elements of the MESH project. EnergyPathways is reviewing a number of options for taking these forward, which includes amending and resubmitting its Gas Storage Licence application to the NSTA.\nS35 Planning Application\nThe direction requested by EnergyPathways would incorporate the major elements of the MESH project critical to the integrated nature of the project including: the MESH compressed air Long Duration Energy Storage (LDES) and flexible low-carbon power generation facilities, onshore gas and hydrogen conditioning facilities, the MESH clean hydrogen production facilities, the MESH clean ammonia and synthetic graphite production facilities.\nThe request for a s.35 direction is a process in which an infrastructure developer seeks approval from the Secretary of State for its project to be treated as a project requiring consent through a Development Consent Order (DCO) process under the Planning Act 2008. A s.35 direction enables the streamlining of the planning process for large-scale infrastructure projects such as MESH, by consolidating various permissions and consents into a single DCO.\nDifferent parts of the project may require other consents and authorisations, but a number of these can be covered by the DCO process. For example, the Marine Management Organisation has advised the Company that, amongst other things, a marine licence under the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 would be required for the compressed air storage LDES aspect of the MESH development: EnergyPathways notes that a marine licence can be incorporated within the DCO process, under which it can be granted on a \"deemed\" basis.\nRequesting a s.35 direction is a key step in EnergyPathways' process to obtain appropriate consents and recognition from the UK Government of the potential of its integrated MESH energy storage and decarbonisation project to be a project of national significance. If a s.35 direction is granted, those elements of the MESH project included in the request will be assessed under the 2008 Planning Act regime\nfor suitability as a development requiring development consent.\nEnergyPathways has consulted with its MESH project development strategic partners Siemens Energy, Hazer Group Ltd, Costain plc and Wood plc in making this request.\nBen Clube EnergyPathways' CEO commented:\n\"We're very pleased to submit this s.35 planning request to the Government which deals with the major elements of the integrated MESH project. Our s.35 submission sets out what we believe to be the significant contribution that the MESH integrated energy project can make to delivering Britain's future ambitions in energy affordability, security and decarbonisation.\nA s.35 submission is a process that can streamline government approvals, cut through red tape and deliver major time and cost benefits in complex projects across design, planning, mobilisation and installation.\nOn the back of the NSTA's decision on our Gas Storage licence application, EnergyPathways is now reviewing a number of options for taking forward the natural gas storage and hydrogen storage elements of the MESH integrated energy storage project which includes resubmitting the application to the NSTA on a different basis. With Clean Power 2030 targets pending, consumer bills rising and energy security under threat, we will be focussed on avenues that can deliver a timely solution.\n\"The S.35 request covers the key elements of the MESH project. MESH's planned LDES and flexible power capacity facilities can help harness value for consumers from Britain's ever-increasing wasted wind power. MESH's low-carbon flexible power capacity can deliver secure, cost-competitive back up power to the grid when the wind is not available. Further, MESH's clean hydrogen production facilities will help kick start decarbonisation of the UK's industrial sector.\n\"If EnergyPathways is successful in its s.35 application, MESH will be well positioned to help further the UK's ambitions to be a global leader in clean energy and deliver on its Clean ",

In collaboration with our consortium of appointed Tier-1 partners, EnergyPathways' team continues to progress MESH to a \"ready-to-go\" status, so that we can move swiftly to FID and deliver on the UK's energy transition ambitions and help provide affordable energy to UK homes and businesses upon award of relevant licences and permits.\"\nAbout MESH\nMESH is a new large scale energy storage facility that is expected to provide a secure and dependable supply of natural gas and clean hydrogen and low carbon flexible power capacity for the UK market for over 25 years.\u00a0MESH is an integrated energy system solution. It is electrifying and integrating existing infrastructure, connecting gas storage, hydrogen storage, and compressed air storage technologies with offshore wind and decarbonised power generation to establish a new major decarbonised energy hub for the UK.\nThe MESH system is designed to harness curtailed offshore wind power in an offshore LDES salt cavern storage as compressed air and hydrogen. Associated with this will be large scale natural gas storage in offshore gas field reservoirs. During periods of low renewable energy availability, stored energy resources will be utilized as follows: compressed natural gas will generate electricity via a gas turbine; compressed air will be expanded through a turbine to produce power; and in the future, hydrogen will be used in a hydrogen-compatible gas turbine or fuel cell to generate electricity.\nThis integrated system is expected to provide low- to zero-carbon dispatchable electricity to the grid, enhancing energy security and flexibility. Emissions from the gas turbine can potentially be captured and stored in nearby CCS reservoirs.\nAdditionally, the stored hydrogen and natural gas can be blended and supplied to the UK gas network, contributing to emissio",

This technology will be used to develop\na bolt-on clean hydrogen facility\nthat will expand the Company's MESH integrated energy storage project\n.\nUnder the MOU, the Company secures the support of Hazer as well as exclusive rights to access Hazer's leading technology within the UK for an initial period of 12 months. Hazer and KBR have formed an exclusive, strategic alliance focused on the licensing and deployment of Hazer's technology in the global ammonia and methanol markets.\nMOU\nUnder the terms of the MOU, Hazer and EnergyPathways (the \"Parties\") have agreed to negotiate and finalise a definitive binding agreement for concept engineering studies for a Hazer licensed facility with an indicative hydrogen production capacity of 90MW (20,000 tonne per annum). The planned MESH hydrogen facility will enable the Company to supply decarbonised energy in the UK and mitigate Scope 3 emissions. The MESH hydrogen facility will use feedstocks from the MESH energy storage project and other sources in order to produce and store hydrogen for flexible clean power generation as well as ammonia for use in the UK and for export. The Company is also targeting production of up to 60,000 tonnes per annum of high-quality synthetic graphite.\nThe scope of the studies will be jointly agreed by the Parties and will leverage the work underway with Hazer's strategic alliance partner KBR for the integration of the Hazer technology with the production of low-carbon ammonia. The studies are to be considered a part of a scoping phase to determine the selected technical design to proceed to detailed Front End Engineering and Design (\"FEED\"). After completion of the concept engineering studies, the Parties will determine whether they wish to proceed into FEED.\nFees, timelines and other terms and conditions for the completion of the concept engineering studies, FEED and technology licensing will be negotiated between the Parties. Under the MOU, Hazer has granted EnergyPathways certain exclusive rights to use Hazer's licensed technology in the UK for an initial period of 12 months.\nMESH Hydrogen Production\nThe 90MW MESH hydrogen facility supports the UK government's re-industrialisation goals by establishing domestic production of clean ammonia and graphite, reducing reliance on imports for critical commodities. The UK Government's energy policy framework supports methane pyrolysis technology as a viable clean-energy pathway recognising its potential to accelerate the decarbonisation of hard-to-abate sectors and the reduction of scope-3 emissions.\nMethane pyrolysis is an eligible technology for financial assistance under the Hydrogen Allocation Round. Hazer's methane pyrolysis technology also meets the required technical readiness level and scalability criteria. Additionally, the UK Government has designated graphite as a critical mineral, noting that the country is currently almost completely reliant on Chinese imports.\nThe UK Government will introduce the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism in 2027, adding a tariff to ammonia imports that will affect UK consumers. The Company aims to competitively produce clean ammonia domestically, supporting UK re-industrialisation and reducing reliance on high-emission, fossil fuel-based ammonia imports.\nThe MESH hydrogen facility is to be included in a request for a Section 35 Direction for a Development Consent Order under the Planning Act 2008.\nBen Clube EnergyPathways' CEO commented:\n\"EnergyPathways continues to progress innovative solutions to ensure MESH delivers a combination of commercial and sustainable benefits that support the UK's wider energy policies. The MOU and partnership to use Hazer technology is a significant milestone for the Company's plans to provide the UK with affordable, reliable low-carbon energy and energy products including clean ammonia and graphite.\n\"The Company plans to develop the large-scale MESH clean hydrogen facility that will bolt onto its MESH integrated storage project, enabling the Company to deliver what we think will be the lowest-cost clean hydrogen production in the UK. The MOU and MESH's hydrogen facility will offer a line of sight to the cost-effective decarbonisation pathway for Scope 3 emissions associated with future UK gas development projects. The project will also produce hydrogen at scale that can further decarbonise MESH's flexible and affordable lo",

MESH, when fully developed, will now also integrate proven compressed air, hydrogen and natural gas storage technologies, providing a potential total storage capacity of around 20 TWh, equivalent to 7% of UK annual electricity demand. When developed, MESH will potentially be Europe's largest Long Duration Energy Storage facility (~400MW), the UK's largest hydrogen storage facility (~2.8TWh), and the UK's largest gas storage facility (~600 million therms).\nEnergy storage is crucial to the UK's national security and to its Net Zero ambitions. Energy security remains a key priority for this Government. The objectives of MESH align with the Government's priorities to reduce emissions, enhance energy security, protect bill payers, and create economic growth and jobs.\nBen Clube, CEO of EnergyPathways said:\n\"\nWe believe that MESH is a crucial project which will support the Government's Net Zero ambitions and we are pleased to be making progress on the highly valuable compressed air storage component of the Project.\n\"The Government has identified the need for more energy storage as a clear priority to reach clean power targets by 2030. The Government's plan requires an infrastructure spending programme that averages a colossal \u00a340bn+ annually. In our view, much of this investment is at risk of being passed onto consumers' bills without the right policy mix being put in place.\n\"The backbone of the Government's plan for achieving clean power by 2030 is a massive expansion of wind power, targeting a capacity that is three times Britain's total current average demand for electricity. Additionally, it requires the ageing UK grid infrastructure to be upgraded to accommodate the variable supply and remote locations of wind farms. Further, the Government plans to install new decarbonised backup power capacity for when the wind doesn't blow. Energy storage is essential to ensure efficient use of taxpayer funds and avoid further escalating consumer bills.\n\"The Government recognises the value that natural gas storage facilities play in energy security as a source of balancing system flexibility, particularly when responding to short-run changes in supply and demand, or during cold winter months.\n\"The Government also considers hydrogen storage infrastructure to be critical to growing the hydrogen economy and to supporting its Clean Power Mission, and it is committed to designing a new business model by the end of 2025 to support investment in, and the development of, hydrogen storage infrastructure. EnergyPathways has been advised that prospective projects, such as MESH, will have the opportunity to apply for Hydrogen Storage Business Model financial support in due course.\n\"In parallel with progressing the pre-FEED aspects of MESH, we continue to engage with authorities in relation to the award of a Gas Storage licence for the MESH project. Engagement with the Government remains constructive and we are actively outlining the multiple benefits of the Project, especially in relation to energy security and energy affordability, and how t",

This measure supports the growth of low carbon electrolytic hydrogen production in the UK, which benefits EnergyPathways' wider hydrogen ambitions.\nEnergyPathways' Planned MESH Project\nEnergyPathways' planned MESH project (\"MESH\" or the \"Project\") is an integrated energy storage hub with an estimated storage capacity of up to 20TWh, equivalent to 7% of the UK's current annual electricity demand.\nThe Project is expected to include the development of a large-scale salt cavern hydrogen storage facility (to be known as MESH-H2) of up to 640 MW, with total storage capacity of 2.8 TWh. The hydrogen storage facility will be integrated with the wider MESH project and linked to regional offshore wind to store and supply decarbonised energy. MESH-H2 will potentially be the UK's largest hydrogen storage facility.\nThe MESH project will also include the development of a 400 MW compressed air Long Duration Energy Storage (LDES) facility, providing a multi-day clean power supply. Once developed, it will have the potential to be the largest LDES facility in Europe. MESH can be enhanced to provide up to 700 MW of low-carbon flexible power through a highly flexible future-proofed hybrid compressed air storage system (H-CAES) that can be transitioned to carbon free hydrogen based power.\nEnergyPathways plans to submit an application in the UK Government's planned Hydrogen Storage Allocation Round and believes the MESH H2 design has competitive attributes that can attract Government support.\nEnergyPathways has also submitted a gas storage licence application to the Government regulator in relation to both hydrogen and natural gas storage development and operations. If successful, EnergyPathways will further progress the MESH development.\nDepartment of Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) Consultation:\nIn its Spring Statement 2025, the UK government committed to removing CCL costs from electricity used in electrolysis to produce hydrogen, currently charged at a rate of \u00a37.75 per MWh. This will support the growth of low carbon electrolytic hydrogen production, which will play an important role in decarbonising the power system and hard to electrify industrial and transport sectors.\nIn conjunction with this commitment, DESNZ has issued a consultation that seeks views to determine the best legislative route to remove these CCL costs and ensure their removal is delivered in a way that achieves the government's objectives, whilst avoiding unintended consequences. The consultation acknowledges that the\nwider energy landscape has changed significantly since CCL was introduced, and will continue to develop\n, therefore the government also announced that it will conduct a wider review of CCL.\nThe consultation recognises that electrolytic hydrogen has the potential to support the delivery of net zero in several different ways and references the Autumn Budget 2024 in which the government confirmed that it would\nsupport projects awarded contracts in the first electrolytic Hydrogen Allocation Round, harnessing renewable energy to decarbonise industry and transport across the length and breadth the of the UK.\nTo inform the scope of this review, the consultation seeks views on other areas where CCL may need to be reviewed to ensure it is aligned with developments in the changing energy landscape and the government's clean power and net zero missions\nThe consultation can be viewed here:\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/climate-change-levy-electrolytic-hydrogen-and-energy-context\nBen Clube, CEO of EnergyPathways said:\n\"It is encouraging to see the UK government increasingly promoting the benefits of the hydrogen economy and emphasising the important role [green] hydrogen will play in decarbonising the UK's energy future. It is also reassuring to see that the UK government is committing to improved fiscal terms that encourage investment into the hydrogen sector. As referenced in the consultation, the changing energy landscape requires stakeholder collaboration to collectively deliver on the UK government's clean power and net zero mission. It is exactly in this context that EnergyPathways is promoting the multiple socioeconomic and environmental benefits of its planned MESH project, that seeks to provide a secure and dependable supply of natural gas, compressed air and green hydrogen for the UK market for over 25 years. We believe that MESH therefore represents an important project in supporting the delivery of the UK's energy policy. It is also n",

Its roadmap to providing security of power supply for the UK centres around\ninstalling new clean sources of power at pace and developing a flexible system\nthat can accommodate and store Britain's\nrenewable resources, while reducing the use of\nunabated gas power generation.\nThe Government is pushing ahead with reforming energy policy, regulations and markets across all sectors of the energy industry to accelerate the UK energy transition.\nThe MESH project is being developed as an integrated energy system. It can play a big part in contributing to Government's 2030 ambitions. It provides the UK Government with large-scale flexible capacity and long duration storage needed to compliment the expansion of wind power capacity. It can be operational as soon as late 2027. As an energy transition project backed by private capital and using the UK's \"best in class\" offshore supply chain and work force to support a \"just transition\", the benefits of MESH are being recognised by Government bodies including the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (\"DESNZ\"), the North Sea Transition Authority (\"NSTA\"), and The Crown Estate.\nThe Company is pleased to report the following developments on MESH:\n\u00b7\nEnergyPathways has signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding (\"MOU\") with a clean energy fund for a cornerstone equity financing, that is priced at multiples to current share price, effectively minimising shareholder dilution. The funding complements the existing Global Green Asset Financing (\"GGAF\") loan facility and, along with other debt financing provides capital for MESH's growth plans in gas storage, hydrogen and decarbonised gas power generation. This provides further demonstration to the Government of MESH's ability to attract private capital to the UK energy transition.\n\u00b7\nfollowing the Company making representations and consultations with the NSTA, an opportunity emerged to request a new straight to development petroleum licence for the MESH project that aligns with the project and supports an accelerated energy transition. The previous P2490 licence has lapsed. The P2490 licence was an old traditional exploration licence that was not ideally structured to allow delivery of the MESH project and was financially less beneficial for the Company.\n\u00b7\nthe Company has commenced discussions with a tier 1 FTSE 100 company regarding an agreement for MESH long term gas storage capacity and gas sales off-take as well as providing project debt financing for the MESH natural gas storage development.\n\u00b7\nthe Company submitted a final concept engineering report for MESH-H2 to DESNZ, MESH-H2 is a large-scale 640MW salt cavern hydrogen storage facility with total storage capacity of 2.8TWh. It will be integrated with the wider MESH project and linked to offshore regional wind to supply decarbonised energy.\n\u00b7\nthe critical decision on the Company's gas storage licence application to the NSTA is expected soon. The development of the MESH gas storage project will advance under this licence through to a development plan approval, construction, installation and into operations involving The Crown Estate and the NSTA.\nBen Clube, CEO of EnergyPathways plc said:\nEnergyPathways looks forward to advancing the MESH project with an award of the gas storage licence. MESH can make a major contribution to accelerating the UK energy transition and meeting the Government's 2030 clean energy targets.\nWe are very pleased to have entered into a non-binding MOU for an equity placing to further demonstrate the Company's ability to attract private capital to the UK's energy transition. In conjunction with the GGAF loan, it has increased the Company's financial flexibility and options and ability to create value for its shareholders.\nOur progress with a Tier 1 FTSE 100 company on a long term gas storage capacity and gas offtake agreement along with project debt financing is very encouraging.\nWith the UK government burdened by mountains of debt and limited scope to push up tax rates further, the UK's heavy reliance on public financing to subsidise energy projects to meet its 2030 clean power target look unsustainable. The opportunities for private capital backed energy transition projects are increasing and it is clear the Government is giving priority to projects that can accelerate the UK's energy transition.\nThe challenges of the UK energy transition are significant for all stakeholders involved. A very understandable challenge for UK regulators is the need to adapt regulations or their application to meet the Government's energy transition amb",

The technical engineering and design studies have been undertaken by EnergyPathways in conjunction with its strategic partners Wood plc, Mermaid Subsea Services (UK) Limited and PDi Ltd.\nThe MESH development has been designed as an\nintegrated energy system solution. MESH\nwill connect gas production, gas storage, hydrogen storage, offshore wind and decarbonised gas power generation to provide the UK with a long term secure and dependable supply of clean energy. MESH has been designed as a decarbonised facility with production operations fully electrified and powered by renewable energy. The MESH development design will repurpose existing late life gas infrastructure as a future energy hub that can help harness the significant energy resources of the North West of England.\nThe MESH project development is initially centred on the development of the Marram Gas Field as a gas storage and production facility. The Final Investment Decision (\"FID\") for this is planned for the end of 2025 with first production operations starting in late 2027.\nThe initial MESH project development involves:\n\u00b7\na new unmanned offshore platform (\"Marram A\") with four well slots, powered by renewables (wind, solar and batteries);\n\u00b7\ntwo initial production wells (to be drilled Q2 2027) in Phase 1, followed by two more for gas storage (Q2 2029) in Phase 2;\n\u00b7\na new 9km pipeline connecting the new \"Marram A\" platform to an existing gas export trunkline following cessation of production from a late life gas field;\n\u00b7\nupgrading and repurposing of existing late life onshore gas facilities with latest modern, low emission technologies to decarbonise MESH gas production and gas storage withdrawal\u00a0and injection operations;\n\u00b7\nre-purposing of industrial land\nin Barrow-in-Furness\nto minimise the Project's environmental footprint and enable a timely start up; and\n\u00b7\na short distance onshore tie-in to the National Gas UK Transmission System\nPhases 1 and 2 will deliver a facility that will store an estimated 500-600 million therms of gas with withdrawal and injection rates of\n1.7-\n2.0 million therms of gas per day\nfrom the combined 4 well storage facility\n.\nThis initial MESH development establishes a central energy hub for future integration with other regional energy projects, including additional gas storage, gas production, hydrogen storage, offshore wind power and low-emission power generation. These future plans for a wider integrated energy system beyond the initial MESH gas storage and production facility are being progressed in regard to:\n\u00b7\nHydrogen Storage (MESH-H2):\nalong with the license application submitted for Marram gas storage, the licence area covers salt cavern hydrogen storage potential. Concept engineering has been completed and submitted to the relevant authorities for a hydrogen storage project (DESNZ, The Crown Estate, NSTA);\n\u00b7\nGas Storage:\nstorage licence application requests have been submitted to the NSTA for the discovered undeveloped Knox and Lowry gas fields that are suitable for gas storage;\n\u00b7\nLow Carbon Energy Production:\nongoing engagement with various stakeholders to connect the region's wind power and to access the East Irish Sea's stranded gas resources with the MESH decarbonised energy hub; and\n\u00b7\nDecarbonised Power Generation (MESH-POWER):\nconcept engineering has been completed for offshore gas power generation designed to complement and support the region's wind power.\nIn addition, EnergyPathways has commissioned studies into static and dynamic storage reservoir and integrated production modelling, in parallel with desktop studies in preparation for the necessary environmental and seabed surveys to be undertaken later this year.\nBen Clube, CEO of EnergyPathways plc said:\n\"We are pleased to provide a summary of what has been a very active period for EnergyPathways as we progress MESH through the pre-FEED stage and we remain on track to achieve FID at the end of 2025. With the development design for the MESH integrated energy system now framed, we can move forward to deliver a major energy project to support the UK's energy transition ambitions.\n\"As a large-scale energy storage facility, MESH can play a critical strategic role in providing the UK with a secure and reliable supply of low emission energy for decades to come. It can play an important role in helping moderate the impact of international gas prices and energy import costs on household bills.\n\"The MESH energy hub capitalises on specific regional dynamics and integrates multiple energy assets t",

EnergyPathways is advancing the UK\u2019s first large-scale high-grade graphite production capability through its flagship MESH project in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. Developed in strategic partnership with Hazer Group Ltd and KBR Inc, global leaders in methane pyrolysis technology, MESH will produce high-purity graphite alongside low-carbon hydrogen in a dual-output model designed to meet a surging demand for a secure supply chain for graphite. With graphite recognised as a Tier-1 critical mineral by the UK Government and subject to growing geopolitical supply constraints, MESH offers a secure, low-carbon alternative to the current Chinese-dominated global supply chains.

I think Carlton Power are still looking to supply Green  Hydrogen Energy from windfarms to the Kimberly Clark factory in Barrow. Maybe the two projects can share some cables. I\u2019ll admit having watched a few episodes of \u2018Yes Minister\u2019 after the General Election in 2024 I nearly kept away, but when the SP dropped, I couldn\u2019t resist. I dipped my toe in the water because I liked the overall concept and thought the use of existing salt caverns as a storage facility was borderline genius. Add the production of graphite as a consequential by-product, the potential for ammonia production and for me the icing was on the cake. I agree that government involvement is always a concern, and yes, it is early days with no guarantee of success.  The cherry on the cake is the involvement of our heavy hitting partners. This makes EPP an even more interesting play moving into 2026 than it was back in 2024. I guess only time will tell, but hopefully Barrow becomes the Green Hydrogen hub of Cumbria and everyone does well out of it. GLA",

Brilliant concept, but never off. Infrastrata also looked at putting an LNG offtake to the Morecambe Field and utilising as storage. Brilliant concept but never came off.

The directors bought before the announcement last time and they seemed to be wrong so I can understand why they are cautious this time. I will say this if the approval doesn\u2019t come through, thw amount of money this company wastes on so many directors and consultants and paid interviews, approximately 2million, that they have raised and spent this last year. It will be a quick finish for this company. So huge upside but huge downside too. It\u2019s 50/50 in my opinion but fingers crossed \ud83e\udd1e",

I expect deep dilution going into the future. Nonetheless it's in my watchlist for next few years.",

We\u2019re just trying to get our name out and that\u2019s why the interviews, nothing sinister about it. When looking at this kind of company you have to ask do they have the right kind of backing and partners and we certainly do, tier 1 partners. They must believe in our projects to partner with ius. We\u2019re so early in this stage of the company that I can only see upsides, please forgive me I don\u2019t have absolute doubts like u. You\u2019re right about one thing,  it\u2019s a long term project so they do have to manage how they dilute but hopefully they can again get the right investors once the approvals from thw government come in. They are going for 6 different avenues so it\u2019s not like they\u2019re putting their eggs in one basket. I think this could be an incredible stock. I wasn\u2019t gonna reply to you cos I can see that with ur history that this is your full time job to bash stocks but I think one reply to you\u2019re constant messages is valid. Also your not gonna get the conflict here you\u2019re looking for, might I suggest going to other stocks to bash to keep yourself entertained. Good luck all, we could be onto something special here",

They are also embarking on a graphite processing study with Mitsui. Companies such as these don\u2019t enter into dealings with just anyone. So, for now I\u2019ll trust the due diligence and vetting done by Siemens Energy et al rather than some guy on LSE.",

The company has highlighted a key thing Is our LDES solution is scalable. It's almost modular. We can add capacity much easier than say a pumped hydro project costing 1bn gbp+ on huge scale. The given targets for ldes are 4 to 6gw minimum by 2030. Now there is some pumped hydro that is advanced by construction could take them out to early 2030s. From what I read salt caverns can be made in a couple of years, which is super fast for infrastructure. Mesh is offering a cheaper capex, diversification of ldes and a timeline that fits. Also geographically you cannot really put up pumped hydro where we are. Most plans are in Scotland. So we need a solution  for the wind farms around mesh. I think we are that solutiom",

Providing grid-friendly loads and growing hydrogen production capacities are key to the further expansion of renewable energy. The two projects will operate exclusively for grid balancing, stabilising the power system, and using underground caverns as hydrogen storage facilities to absorb the discrepancies between electricity supply and hydrogen consumption. This is referred to as \"predispatch\". This mode of operation called \"Netzbr\u00fccke\", or \"grid bridge\", is intended primarily to reduce \"redispatch\". Redispatch is an intervention used to eliminate bottlenecks in the electricity grid. Grid operators adjust power plant output by reducing generation ahead of a congestion point and simultaneously increasing generation behind it. Redispatch has become necessary due to the expansion of renewable energy, whose feed-in is weather-dependent and geographically uneven. Negative redispatch results in annual costs of 2-3 billion Euros to German taxpayers. Reducing these costs to zero while putting surplus energy to meaningful use, \"complementary hybrid redispatch\", short \"predispatch\", contributes substantial cost savings to the expansion of renewable energy.",

EnergyPathways is advancing the UK\u2019s first large-scale high-grade graphite production capability through its flagship MESH project in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. Developed in strategic partnership with Hazer Group Ltd and KBR Inc, global leaders in methane pyrolysis technology, MESH will produce high-purity graphite alongside low-carbon hydrogen in a dual-output model designed to meet a surging demand for a secure supply chain for graphite. With graphite recognised as a Tier-1 critical mineral by the UK Government and subject to growing geopolitical supply constraints, MESH offers a secure, low-carbon alternative to the current Chinese-dominated global supply chains. MESH\u2019s scale, purity, and strategic location within the UK\u2019s industrial heartland create a compelling long-term value proposition for investors. By delivering high-purity graphite at scale, MESH will: \u2022 Reduce UK and EU dependence on imported natural graphite \u2022 Support domestic battery manufacturing and energy storage industries \u2022 Align with UK Net Zero and Critical Minerals Strategy objectives \u2022 Provide a resilient, low-carbon supply chain for a Tier-1 critical mineral In September 2025, the UK Government designated MESH as a development of National Significance under the Planning Act 2008, recognising its strategic role in energy security, industrial decarbonisation, and critical minerals supply.

I look back to when the Morecambe Bay field was routed to the Barrow Terminal and then Rivers - you could count local hire in singular figures if you exclude gardening, fencing and local security jobs. I might add that all the Wind farms export cables go to Lytham St Annes - not Barrow.

I think Carlton Power are still looking to supply Green  Hydrogen Energy from windfarms to the Kimberly Clark factory in Barrow. Maybe the two projects can share some cables. I\u2019ll admit having watched a few episodes of \u2018Yes Minister\u2019 after the General Election in 2024 I nearly kept away, but when the SP dropped, I couldn\u2019t resist. I dipped my toe in the water because I liked the overall concept and thought the use of existing salt caverns as a storage facility was borderline genius. Add the production of graphite as a consequential by-product, the potential for ammonia production and for me the icing was on the cake. I agree that government involvement is always a concern, and yes, it is early days with no guarantee of success.  The cherry on the cake is the involvement of our heavy hitting partners. This makes EPP an even more interesting play moving into 2026 than it was back in 2024. I guess only time will tell, but hopefully Barrow becomes the Green Hydrogen hub of Cumbria and everyone does well out of it. GLA",

Brilliant concept, but never off. Infrastrata also looked at putting an LNG offtake to the Morecambe Field and utilising as storage. Brilliant concept but never came off. Kicked myself for not buying at 1.7p but I had my doubts and bought eco atlantic instead. As you say time will tell and I hope it comes off.",

The directors bought before the announcement last time and they seemed to be wrong so I can understand why they are cautious this time. I will say this if the approval doesn\u2019t come through, thw amount of money this company wastes on so many directors and consultants and paid interviews, approximately 2million, that they have raised and spent this last year. It will be a quick finish for this company. So huge upside but huge downside too. It\u2019s 50/50 in my opinion but fingers crossed \ud83e\udd1e",

Cheapest low carbon hydrogen in uk Only source of ammonia Only source of graphite, and to annode Largest gas storage facility. But the biggest prize for gov is ldes. It is their key objective. If our power is cheaper than gas they can lower the cost of every unit of electricity purchased. If ldes is cheaper than gas, then on some days ldes sets the price and not expensive gas using LNG. I think the cost of using the curtailed power. 1bn rising to 6bn is important. But if you think beyond the cosy of using unused power, the benefit to the country of lowering the energy price paid by consumers and hitting a key manifesto pledge is huge. Gov is under pressure. If it makes economic sense and political sense, then this gets approved",

Cheapest low carbon hydrogen in uk Only source of ammonia Only source of graphite, and to annode Largest gas storage facility. But the biggest prize for gov is ldes. It is their key objective. If our power is cheaper than gas they can lower the cost of every unit of electricity purchased. If ldes is cheaper than gas, then on some days ldes sets the price and not expensive gas using LNG. I think the cost of using the curtailed power. 1bn rising to 6bn is important. But if you think beyond the cosy of using unused power, the benefit to the country of lowering the energy price paid by consumers and hitting a key manifesto pledge is huge. Gov is under pressure. If it makes economic sense and political sense, then this gets approved",

Unlocking growth opportunities on the pathway to clean energy by accelerating investment into the most critical projects, technologies and industries that enable decarbonisation and have the potential to lower bills for households and businesses. 2. Accelerating place-based investment across all four nations of the UK by providing financing and expert advice to regionally significant projects through the Regional Project Accelerator and investing in the enabling infrastructure to support regional growth. 3. Strengthening sovereign and strategic capabilities by investing in growth opportunities underpinning the UK\u2019s national security, enabling UK leadership in industries of the future, and backing domestic supply chains for growth and resilience. This includes critical minerals, defence, green steel and AI. To achieve these ambitions, the National Wealth Fund will be adopting a more targeted approach, focusing on Industrial Strategy sectors and Infrastructure Strategy priorities, where it can make a real difference. The following 10 sectors have been identified where the Fund expects to have the most catalytic opportunities over the next five years: Ports & supply chains* Carbon capture, usage and storage* Hydrogen* Battery manufacturing & the electric vehicle supply chain* Steel* Power grid Energy storage Nuclear Transport infrastructure Place-based regenerati Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: \"Clean energy is not just about energy sovereignty, it is about bringing back the good industrial jobs that have been denied to our country for too long. Thanks to the certainty of the government's clean energy superpower mission and public investment like this - the industry is responding with record investment- meaning better jobs for people across our country.\" https://www.linkedin.com/posts/energypathways-plc_cleanenergy-netzero-renewables-activity-7404496356846882816-ndEF?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAADe2J_YBSBZUVuL6QadAXI43GtnMXw0_tnw",

Unlocking growth opportunities on the pathway to clean energy by accelerating investment into the most critical projects, technologies and industries that enable decarbonisation and have the potential to lower bills for households and businesses. 2. Accelerating place-based investment across all four nations of the UK by providing financing and expert advice to regionally significant projects through the Regional Project Accelerator and investing in the enabling infrastructure to support regional growth. 3. Strengthening sovereign and strategic capabilities by investing in growth opportunities underpinning the UK\u2019s national security, enabling UK leadership in industries of the future, and backing domestic supply chains for growth and resilience. This includes critical minerals, defence, green steel and AI. To achieve these ambitions, the National Wealth Fund will be adopting a more targeted approach, focusing on Industrial Strategy sectors and Infrastructure Strategy priorities, where it can make a real difference. The following 10 sectors have been identified where the Fund expects to have the most catalytic opportunities over the next five years: Ports & supply chains* Carbon capture, usage and storage* Hydrogen* Battery manufacturing & the electric vehicle supply chain* Steel* Power grid Energy storage Nuclear Transport infrastructure Place-based regenerati Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: \"Clean energy is not just about energy sovereignty, it is about bringing back the good industrial jobs that have been denied to our country for too long.

Are you stupid, there won\u2019t be revenue for atleast 5 yrs. my point was that the company should watch its outgoings or raise will have to come and then we\u2019re back down again. I think the company has a great future but I just wanted to give a balanced opinion. If you can\u2019t manage one, be quiet.",

Ldes is split into short end solutions like  flow batteries giving up to  12h storage and then long end multi day pumped hydro. There is not alot offering 12hr to 7w where we are. The question is does the gov see a role for our 0.3 gw project in this window. We'll  I would think yes, 0.3 gw is a maybe 2pct of the 16gw required, you would want something in this 10hr plus window to 7 days which we provide So how do they build capacity in this 12hr to 7 day timeframe. Do we do it all with pumped hydro. 5 to 8 yr build times. Capex intensity maybe 2 to 3x ours. Not modular has to be big projects. Or do they find it in their hearts to substitute a tiny bit of pumped hydro for our low capex, 2yr build, modular solution Cap and floor mechanisms guarantee returns on capex so clearly we are a cheaper guarantee. Also 0.3GW is a tiny amount relative to system demand. Seems logical they approve.",

          "content": "EnergyPathways (EPP) is currently in a high-stakes \"waiting room\" for several critical regulatory and financial approvals. While the company has made significant strides recently\u2014most notably with the UK government\u2019s 2026 recognition of its project as \"nationally significant\"\u2014it is currently holding for the following milestones: 1. Gas Storage & Hydrogen Licences EnergyPathways has formally applied for expanded licences to develop natural gas and hydrogen storage caverns in the Irish Sea. This application covers a vastly larger area than originally planned (up to 60 salt caverns). They are essentially waiting for the North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA) and the Department for Energy Security & Net Zero (DESNZ) to green-light these specific storage rights. 2. Final Investment Decision (FID) The company is working toward its Final Investment Decision, which was recently projected for late 2025 or early 2026. This is the \"point of no return\" where the board and investors officially commit the capital needed to start construction. To get here, they are waiting to: Finalize project financing: They are in discussions with the lending arm of a major integrated oil and gas company to secure debt-heavy financing. Secure \"Offtake\" Partners: They need signed agreements from companies or utilities committed to buying the stored gas or hydrogen once the facility is live. 3. Grid Connection & Planning Permission As part of the MESH (Marram Energy Storage Hub) project, they are waiting for a Development Consent Order (DCO). Because the project is now \"Nationally Significant,\" they get a more streamlined planning process, but it still requires formal government sign-off. Additionally, like many UK energy projects, they are navigating the queue for grid access to ensure they can actually transmit power to and from the facility. 4. Technical Engineering Completion While basic designs are set, they are currently undergoing Front End Engineering Design (FEED) studies with partners like Wood Group, Siemens Energy, and KBR. They are waiting for the final results of these studies to pinpoint exact construction costs and timelines. Current Status Summary | Milestone | Status | | :--- | :--- | | Project Significance | Achieved (Designated as \"Nationally Significant\" by UK Gov) | | Storage Licences | Pending (Application submitted Nov 2024/Jan 2025) | | Project Financing | In Progress (Negotiating with major lenders) | | First Energy Supply | Targeted for late 2027 | Would you like me to look into the specific details of their partnership with Siemens Energy or the recent financial results they released? I asked AI what is Energy Pathways waiting for and the above is its response. I do not always trust AI but it does give a postive view The adverts on this site are terrible . I can barley see what I am after. I think I will stick with ADVFN",

It is developing the MESH Project, one of the UK\u2019s most ambitious integrated gas and hydrogen storage schemes, despite a current market cap of around \u00a38m. The flagship MESH H2 system includes 640MW (2.8TWh) of green hydrogen capacity\u2014the largest in the UK\u2014alongside 400MW of long-duration energy storage via compressed air, set to be Europe\u2019s largest, and 600m therms of gas storage, which would surpass the Rough field as the UK\u2019s biggest. Funding and commercial foundations are already in place, with MOUs signed with cornerstone investors at multiples of the current share price, debt and gas offtake agreed with a FTSE 100 major, and equity commitments at a premium to the current valuation. The project is further underpinned by strategic partnerships with industry leaders including Wood Group, Siemens Energy, Costain, KBR/Hazer, major offshore wind developers, and FTSE 100 oil, gas, and wind operators\u2014suggesting the market re-rating is yet to begin.",

Unlocking growth opportunities on the pathway to clean energy by accelerating investment into the most critical projects, technologies and industries that enable decarbonisation and have the potential to lower bills for households and businesses. 2. Accelerating place-based investment across all four nations of the UK by providing financing and expert advice to regionally significant projects through the Regional Project Accelerator and investing in the enabling infrastructure to support regional growth. 3. Strengthening sovereign and strategic capabilities by investing in growth opportunities underpinning the UK\u2019s national security, enabling UK leadership in industries of the future, and backing domestic supply chains for growth and resilience. This includes critical minerals, defence, green steel and AI. To achieve these ambitions, the National Wealth Fund will be adopting a more targeted approach, focusing on Industrial Strategy sectors and Infrastructure Strategy priorities, where it can make a real difference. The following 10 sectors have been identified where the Fund expects to have the most catalytic opportunities over the next five years: Ports & supply chains* Carbon capture, usage and storage* Hydrogen* Battery manufacturing & the electric vehicle supply chain* Steel* Power grid Energy storage Nuclear Transport infrastructure Place-based regenerati Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: \"Clean energy is not just about energy sovereignty, it is about bringing back the good industrial jobs that have been denied to our country for too long. Thanks to the certainty of the government's clean energy superpower mission and public investment like this - the industry is responding with record investment- meaning better jobs for people across our country.\" https://www.linkedin.com/posts/energypathways-plc_cleanenergy-netzero-renewables-activity-7404496356846882816-ndEF?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAADe2J_YBSBZUVuL6QadAXI43GtnMXw0_tnw",

Add that with the fact this company makes no money for the foreseeable future. I\u2019m not as high as i used to be to be honest but am waiting for the approval, if it doesn\u2019t come, let\u2019s be honest the way it\u2019s managed, the company will go into oblivion. It\u2019s a gamble, I am in it, think it will pay off but the management has to be better.",

Ldes is split into short end solutions like  flow batteries giving up to  12h storage and then long end multi day pumped hydro. There is not alot offering 12hr to 7w where we are. The question is does the gov see a role for our 0.3 gw project in this window. We'll  I would think yes, 0.3 gw is a maybe 2pct of the 16gw required, you would want something in this 10hr plus window to 7 days which we provide So how do they build capacity in this 12hr to 7 day timeframe. Do we do it all with pumped hydro. 5 to 8 yr build times. Capex intensity maybe 2 to 3x ours. Not modular has to be big projects. Or do they find it in their hearts to substitute a tiny bit of pumped hydro for our low capex, 2yr build, modular solution Cap and floor mechanisms guarantee returns on capex so clearly we are a cheaper guarantee. Also 0.3GW is a tiny amount relative to system demand. Seems logical they approve.",

          "content": "EnergyPathways (EPP) is currently in a high-stakes \"waiting room\" for several critical regulatory and financial approvals. While the company has made significant strides recently\u2014most notably with the UK government\u2019s 2026 recognition of its project as \"nationally significant\"\u2014it is currently holding for the following milestones: 1. Gas Storage & Hydrogen Licences EnergyPathways has formally applied for expanded licences to develop natural gas and hydrogen storage caverns in the Irish Sea. This application covers a vastly larger area than originally planned (up to 60 salt caverns). They are essentially waiting for the North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA) and the Department for Energy Security & Net Zero (DESNZ) to green-light these specific storage rights. 2. Final Investment Decision (FID) The company is working toward its Final Investment Decision, which was recently projected for late 2025 or early 2026. This is the \"point of no return\" where the board and investors officially commit the capital needed to start construction. To get here, they are waiting to: Finalize project financing: They are in discussions with the lending arm of a major integrated oil and gas company to secure debt-heavy financing. Secure \"Offtake\" Partners: They need signed agreements from companies or utilities committed to buying the stored gas or hydrogen once the facility is live. 3. Grid Connection & Planning Permission As part of the MESH (Marram Energy Storage Hub) project, they are waiting for a Development Consent Order (DCO). Because the project is now \"Nationally Significant,\" they get a more streamlined planning process, but it still requires formal government sign-off. Additionally, like many UK energy projects, they are navigating the queue for grid access to ensure they can actually transmit power to and from the facility. 4. Technical Engineering Completion While basic designs are set, they are currently undergoing Front End Engineering Design (FEED) studies with partners like Wood Group, Siemens Energy, and KBR. They are waiting for the final results of these studies to pinpoint exact construction costs and timelines. Current Status Summary | Milestone | Status | | :--- | :--- | | Project Significance | Achieved (Designated as \"Nationally Significant\" by UK Gov) | | Storage Licences | Pending (Application submitted Nov 2024/Jan 2025) | | Project Financing | In Progress (Negotiating with major lenders) | | First Energy Supply | Targeted for late 2027 | Would you like me to look into the specific details of their partnership with Siemens Energy or the recent financial results they released? I asked AI what is Energy Pathways waiting for and the above is its response. I do not always trust AI but it does give a postive view The adverts on this site are terrible . I can barley see what I am after. I think I will stick with ADVFN",

Unlocking growth opportunities on the pathway to clean energy by accelerating investment into the most critical projects, technologies and industries that enable decarbonisation and have the potential to lower bills for households and businesses. 2. Accelerating place-based investment across all four nations of the UK by providing financing and expert advice to regionally significant projects through the Regional Project Accelerator and investing in the enabling infrastructure to support regional growth. 3. Strengthening sovereign and strategic capabilities by investing in growth opportunities underpinning the UK\u2019s national security, enabling UK leadership in industries of the future, and backing domestic supply chains for growth and resilience. This includes critical minerals, defence, green steel and AI. To achieve these ambitions, the National Wealth Fund will be adopting a more targeted approach, focusing on Industrial Strategy sectors and Infrastructure Strategy priorities, where it can make a real difference. The following 10 sectors have been identified where the Fund expects to have the most catalytic opportunities over the next five years: Ports & supply chains* Carbon capture, usage and storage* Hydrogen* Battery manufacturing & the electric vehicle supply chain* Steel* Power grid Energy storage Nuclear Transport infrastructure Place-based regenerati Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: \"Clean energy is not just about energy sovereignty, it is about bringing back the good industrial jobs that have been denied to our country for too long. Thanks to the certainty of the government's clean energy superpower mission and public investment like this - the industry is responding with record investment- meaning better jobs for people across our country.\" https://www.linkedin.com/posts/energypathways-plc_cleanenergy-netzero-renewables-activity-7404496356846882816-ndEF?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAADe2J_YBSBZUVuL6QadAXI43GtnMXw0_tnw",

Ldes is split into short end solutions like  flow batteries giving up to  12h storage and then long end multi day pumped hydro. There is not alot offering 12hr to 7w where we are. The question is does the gov see a role for our 0.3 gw project in this window. We'll  I would think yes, 0.3 gw is a maybe 2pct of the 16gw required, you would want something in this 10hr plus window to 7 days which we provide So how do they build capacity in this 12hr to 7 day timeframe. Do we do it all with pumped hydro. 5 to 8 yr build times. Capex intensity maybe 2 to 3x ours. Not modular has to be big projects. Or do they find it in their hearts to substitute a tiny bit of pumped hydro for our low capex, 2yr build, modular solution Cap and floor mechanisms guarantee returns on capex so clearly we are a cheaper guarantee. Also 0.3GW is a tiny amount relative to system demand. Seems logical they approve.",

          "content": "EnergyPathways (EPP) is currently in a high-stakes \"waiting room\" for several critical regulatory and financial approvals. While the company has made significant strides recently\u2014most notably with the UK government\u2019s 2026 recognition of its project as \"nationally significant\"\u2014it is currently holding for the following milestones: 1. Gas Storage & Hydrogen Licences EnergyPathways has formally applied for expanded licences to develop natural gas and hydrogen storage caverns in the Irish Sea. This application covers a vastly larger area than originally planned (up to 60 salt caverns). They are essentially waiting for the North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA) and the Department for Energy Security & Net Zero (DESNZ) to green-light these specific storage rights. 2. Final Investment Decision (FID) The company is working toward its Final Investment Decision, which was recently projected for late 2025 or early 2026. This is the \"point of no return\" where the board and investors officially commit the capital needed to start construction. To get here, they are waiting to: Finalize project financing: They are in discussions with the lending arm of a major integrated oil and gas company to secure debt-heavy financing. Secure \"Offtake\" Partners: They need signed agreements from companies or utilities committed to buying the stored gas or hydrogen once the facility is live. 3. Grid Connection & Planning Permission As part of the MESH (Marram Energy Storage Hub) project, they are waiting for a Development Consent Order (DCO). Because the project is now \"Nationally Significant,\" they get a more streamlined planning process, but it still requires formal government sign-off. Additionally, like many UK energy projects, they are navigating the queue for grid access to ensure they can actually transmit power to and from the facility. 4. Technical Engineering Completion While basic designs are set, they are currently undergoing Front End Engineering Design (FEED) studies with partners like Wood Group, Siemens Energy, and KBR. They are waiting for the final results of these studies to pinpoint exact construction costs and timelines. Current Status Summary | Milestone | Status | | :--- | :--- | | Project Significance | Achieved (Designated as \"Nationally Significant\" by UK Gov) | | Storage Licences | Pending (Application submitted Nov 2024/Jan 2025) | | Project Financing | In Progress (Negotiating with major lenders) | | First Energy Supply | Targeted for late 2027 | Would you like me to look into the specific details of their partnership with Siemens Energy or the recent financial results they released? I asked AI what is Energy Pathways waiting for and the above is its response. I do not always trust AI but it does give a postive view The adverts on this site are terrible . I can barley see what I am after. I think I will stick with ADVFN",

Unlocking growth opportunities on the pathway to clean energy by accelerating investment into the most critical projects, technologies and industries that enable decarbonisation and have the potential to lower bills for households and businesses. 2. Accelerating place-based investment across all four nations of the UK by providing financing and expert advice to regionally significant projects through the Regional Project Accelerator and investing in the enabling infrastructure to support regional growth. 3. Strengthening sovereign and strategic capabilities by investing in growth opportunities underpinning the UK\u2019s national security, enabling UK leadership in industries of the future, and backing domestic supply chains for growth and resilience. This includes critical minerals, defence, green steel and AI. To achieve these ambitions, the National Wealth Fund will be adopting a more targeted approach, focusing on Industrial Strategy sectors and Infrastructure Strategy priorities, where it can make a real difference. The following 10 sectors have been identified where the Fund expects to have the most catalytic opportunities over the next five years: Ports & supply chains* Carbon capture, usage and storage* Hydrogen* Battery manufacturing & the electric vehicle supply chain* Steel* Power grid Energy storage Nuclear Transport infrastructure Place-based regenerati Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said: \"Clean energy is not just about energy sovereignty, it is about bringing back the good industrial jobs that have been denied to our country for too long. Thanks to the certainty of the government's clean energy superpower mission and public investment like this - the industry is responding with record investment- meaning better jobs for people across our country.\" https://www.linkedin.com/posts/energypathways-plc_cleanenergy-netzero-renewables-activity-7404496356846882816-ndEF?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android&rcm=ACoAADe2J_YBSBZUVuL6QadAXI43GtnMXw0_tnw",
