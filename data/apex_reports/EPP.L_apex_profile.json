This represents an almost fourfold increase in the area EnergyPathways is targeting for salt cavern development.\nThe Company intends to submit an application to the Secretary of State for a Development Consent Order (DCO) for the other elements of the MESH project.\nBen Clube, CEO of EnergyPathways, said:\n\"We are delighted to have formally submitted a natural gas and hydrogen storage licence application for MESH. Following the positive endorsement of MESH by the Secretary of State as a development of national significance, we are hopeful of receiving a decision on this application soon.\n\"If successful with its application, EnergyPathways plans to progress a hydrogen storage and transportation project which will be integrated with its 90 MW methane pyrolysis hydrogen production facility being developed in conjunction with KBR and Hazer*. The planned hydrogen storage will be able to supply the Company's hydrogen-to-power system being developed with Siemens Energy**.\n\"The Company also plans to develop natural gas storage to help shore up the UK's security of energy supply. The UK has meagre existing gas storage capacity. The Company considers this licence area, and the Irish Sea region more broadly, as having significant potential for large-scale economic development of natural gas storage.\n\"We look forward to updating the market in due course.\"\n*\nKBR Inc. and Hazer Limited\n** Siemens Energy Global GmbH & Co. KG\nAbout MESH\nMESH will be a new, large scale, energy storage and decarbonisation facility that is expected to provide a secure and dependable supply of affordable low-carbon energy for the UK market for over 25 years.\nThe MESH integrated energy system solution comprises; large-scale Long Duration Energy Storage (\"LDES\"), flexible low-carbon power capacity and low-carbon hydrogen and graphite production with the potential to branch into low-carbon ammonia production. MESH will connect its LDES integrated storage system using existing infrastructure to the UK grid and nearby offshore wind capacity to help harness value from some of the billions of pounds of the UK's wasted wind power.\nThe MESH system is designed to capture and store curtailed offshore wind power in offshore salt caverns as compressed air. The MESH energy storage system combines associated large-scale hydrogen, thermal and natural gas storage capacity in geo-storage features (the salt caverns). During periods of low renewable energy availability, the LDES stored energy resources will be utilised to generate low-carbon flexible power for the UK's grid via compressed air expansion, thermal energy and hydrogen-compatible gas turbine systems to generate electricity.\nThe MESH facility will also produce affordable low-carbon hydrogen using methane pyrolysis technology for which EnergyPathways has exclusive rights of use within the UK. The hydrogen can be used to further decarbonise the MESH flexible power generation system using its hydrogen compatible gas turbine system. The by-product of the MESH hydrogen production facility is a high-grade form of synthetic graphite.\nIn addition to supplying dispatchable low-carbon electricity to the grid, MESH-produced hydrogen can support the UK's emerging Project Union hydrogen network, contributing to broader emissions reductions across the energy system.\nThe MESH project is targeted to be operational by 2030, subject to government approvals and financing, in order to contribute to the Government's 2030 Clean Power ambitions. EnergyPathways aims to play its role in supporting the Government in accelerating the UK's energy transition.\nInvestor Engagement with EnergyPathways\nEngage with us by asking questions, watching video summaries and seeing what other shareholders have to say.

KG (\"Siemens Energy\") for the development of long-duration energy storage (LDES) systems based on Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) technology, integrated with hydrogen-compatible power systems.\nThe Agreement outlines a global framework for collaboration on the development and possible delivery of a Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) system\nto effectively utilise excess offshore wind or excess green power that could be deployed across a variety of locations worldwide. Siemens Energy is a leading global energy technology and engineering company in this field.\nUnder the Agreement, EnergyPathways and Siemens Energy will form a joint taskforce. Siemens Energy will provide its world-class engineering capabilities and technology portfolio, while EnergyPathways will contribute its proprietary LDES geo-storage expertise, intellectual property, and energy projects and markets expertise.\nThe partnership will focus on designing and developing an efficient, cost-competitive long-duration CAES system enabling multi-day operation and flexible, low-carbon, power generation. The aim is to design a modular and scalable system.\nThe partnership will initially target opportunities to support the UK's clean power and energy security goals, beginning with EnergyPathways' planned MESH project's LDES and flexible low carbon power system, in the East Irish Sea and Cumbria.\nThe Agreement is non-binding and sets out the basis for entering into formal long-term or partnership contracts that would be concluded in due course.\nBen Clube, CEO of EnergyPathways, said:\n\"This cooperation agreement with Siemens Energy demonstrates our commitment to partnering with world leaders in clean energy technology and engineering.\n\"The Agreement positions the Company as a leader in the development of LDES with multi-day power supply which can harness wasted renewable power at scale. Affordable multi-day LDES is the missing piece of the puzzle that can deliver affordable and reliable power supply within renewables dominated grids.\"\n\"In partnership with Siemens Energy, we aim to design and develop a modular multi-day LDES system that can be scaled and deployed around the world. This has the potential to make renewables dominated grid systems more affordable for consumers and taxpayers.\n\"Our MESH project is planned as the first to be delivered under this Agreement.\"\nAbout Siemens Energy\nSiemens Energy is a global leader in energy technology, driving the transition to a more sustainable world by developing innovative systems for power generation, transmission, and storage.
