The delay in publishing the 2025 Accounts is predominantly due to the impact of the recent disposal of operations in Mozambique delaying the provision of certain audit information to the Company's auditors in accordance with previously agreed timetables. Although substantially all of the information has now been provided, the Company's auditors no longer have sufficient resources and capacity to be allocated to the assignment and accordingly are not able to complete their work by the end of September 2025.\nAs a result of this delay, the Company is not able to comply with the requirements of AIM Rule 19 of the AIM Rules for Companies, which requires publication of the 2025 Accounts within 6 months of the year end. Accordingly, the Company's ordinary shares will be suspended from trading on AIM with effect from 7:30 a.m. on Wednesday 1 October 2025. The temporary suspension from trading on AIM will be lifted once the 2025 Accounts have been published (during October 2025, as noted above).\nNotwithstanding the temporary suspension of trading in the Company's ordinary shares, the Company will continue to make announcements as and when there are any developments that require announcement in accordance with its obligations under the AIM Rules for Companies.\n** ENDS **\nThe information contained within this announcement is considered to be inside information prior to its release, as defined in Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation No. 596/2014, and is disclosed in accordance with the Company's obligations under Article 17 of those Regulations.\nFor further information please visit www.pacsco.co.uk or contact:\nPACSCo Limited\nCaroline Havers\ncaroline@agriterra-ltd.com\nStrand Hanson Limited\nNominated & Financial Adviser\nRitchie Balmer / James Spinney\n+44 (0) 207 409 3494\nPeterhouse Capital Limited\nBroker\nDuncan Vasey / Eran Zucker\n+44 (0) 207 469 0930\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
