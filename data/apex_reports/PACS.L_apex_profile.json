Upon the publication of this announcement, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nPACSCo Limited / Ticker: PACS / Index: AIM / Sector: Agriculture\nPACSCo Limited ('PACSCo' or the 'Company')\nInterim Results and Restoration to Trading\nPACSCo Limited, announces its unaudited results for the six months ended 30 September 2025.\nChair's Statement\nI am pleased to provide an update on the first half of the 2026 financial year ('HY-2026'). These results are available on the Company's website.\nAt a general meeting held on 31 March 2025, the shareholders approved resolutions to dispose of the Group's Mozambique Agricultural Businesses (the \"\nMozambique Agricultural Businesses\n\" or ''Discontinued activities/operations'') to Chepstow Investments Limited (\"\nChepstow\n\") (the \"\nDisposal\n\") and to change the Company's name from Agriterra Limited to PACSCo Limited. Accordingly, the operating results of the Mozambique Agricultural Businesses and the comparatives have been disclosed as discontinued activities/operations. Completion of the disposal is contingent upon the receipt of certain regulatory approvals in Mozambique.\nFinancial Review\nWith the transfer of control of the Mozambique Agricultural Businesses to Chepstow, following shareholder approval of the Disposal, the Mozambique businesses were deconsolidated at 31 March 2025. Accordingly, the Company is reporting a loss on continuing activities of US$ 137,000 (HY25: US$ 858,000).\nOutlook\nApproval for the disposal has been received from the Competition Regulatory Authority (\"CRA\") in Mozambique. Once approval for the transaction is received from the Bank of Mozambique, the Company will continue to be quoted on AIM as an AIM Rule 15 cash shell which the Directors expect will provide opportunities to create and deliver enhanced shareholder returns.\nRestoration to trading on AIM\nFollowing the publication of the 2025 Annual Report earlier today, and these 2026 interim results, trading in the Company's ordinary shares on the AIM market is expected to be restored at 7.30 a.m. on Tuesday 3 February 2026.\nCSO Havers\nChair\n2 February 2026\nFor further information please VISIT

incorporated and domiciled in Guernsey, Channel Islands. The address of its registered office is\n2nd Floor, Lefebvre Place, Lefebvre Street,\nSt Peter Port, St Pierre du Bois,\nGY1 2JP, Guernsey\n.\nThe Company's Ordinary Shares are quoted on the AIM Market of the London Stock Exchange ('AIM').\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in United States Dollars ('US$' or 'US$') as this is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.\n1. Basis of preparation\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements of the Group for the 6 months ended 30 September 2025 (the 'H1-2026 financial statements'), which are unaudited and have not been reviewed by the Company's Auditor, have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS'). The accounting policies adopted by the Group are set out in the annual report for the year ended 31 March 2025 (available at www.PACSCo-ltd.com). The Group does not anticipate any significant change in these accounting policies for the year ended 31 March 2026.\nThis interim report has been prepared to comply with the requirements of the AIM Rules of the London Stock Exchange (the 'AIM Rules'). In preparing this report, the Group has adopted the guidance in the AIM Rules for interim accounts which do not require that the interim condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with IAS 34,\n'Interim financial reporting'\n. Whilst the financial figures included in this report have been computed in accordance with IFRSs applicable to interim periods, this report does not contain sufficient information to constitute an interim financial report as that term is defined in IFRSs.\nThe financial information contained in this report also does not constitute statutory accounts under the Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008, as amended. The financial information for the year ended 31 March 2025 is based on the statutory accounts for the year then ended. The Auditors reported on those accounts. Their report was unqualified and referred to going concern as a key audit matter.\nThe H1-2026 financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the IFRS principles applicable to a going concern, which contemplate the realisation of assets and liquidation of liabilities during the normal course of operations. Having carried out a going concern review in preparing the H1-2026 financial statements, the Directors have concluded that there is a reasonable basis to adopt the going concern principle.\n2. Segment information\nAs the operating businesses were disposed of on 31 March 2025, the Mozambique Agricultural Businesses have been deemed to be one operating segment and disclosed as discontinued activities in the comparatives.\n3.

Following the transfer of control to Chepstow on 31 March 2025, these businesses were deconsolidated and their activities disclosed as discontinued activities. The comparatives have been adjusted accordingly. The consideration received was the waiver of shareholder loans and other liabilities to Chepstow amounting to $15,281,000.

Despite the best efforts of the Board to improve the situation by taking actions including (without limitation); implementing a retrenchment programme in the year ended 31 March 2023; and undertaking a strategic review which led to the formulation of a 5-year plan to improve and expand the operational performance across all divisions to achieve profitability.\nAt a general meeting held on 31 March 2025, the shareholders approved resolutions to dispose of the Group's Mozambique Agricultural Businesses (the \"\nMozambique Agriculture Businesses\n\" or ''Discontinued activities/operations'') to Chepstow Investments Limited (\"\nChepstow\n\") (the \"\nDisposal\n\") and to change the Company's name from Agriterra Limited to PACSCo Limited. Accordingly, the operating results of the Mozambique Agricultural Businesses and the comparatives have been disclosed as discontinued activities/operations.\nFinancial Review\nDespite the efforts described above, the Company is reporting a loss on continuing activities of US$1,561,000 (FY24: US$ 1,414,000). Turnover on the Mozambique Agriculture Businesses (disclosed as discontinued activities) improved to US$ 13,591,000 (FY24: US$ 10,393,000). The loss on discontinued activities before tax reduced to US$ 699,000 (FY24: US$ 1,927,000). After a tax credit of US$ 127,000 (FY24: US$ 127,000) the loss on discontinued activities was US$572,000 (FY24: US$ 1,800,000). The loss on disposal of discontinued activities (note 11) reported in the income statement is US$ 26,531,000 (FY24: US$ nil) and the overall loss on discontinued activities was US$ 27,103,000 (FY24: US$ 1,800,000).\nWith the transfer of control of operations of the Mozambique Agriculture Businesses to Chepstow, following shareholder approval of the disposal, the Mozambique businesses were deconsolidated at 31 March 2025. As at the date of this report, final completion of the disposal is still pending Bank of Mozambique (the Mozambique central bank) approval.\nOutlook\nWhile considerable efforts have been made to stabilise and grow the Mozambique Agricultural Businesses over many years, there have been consistent and significant internal and external challenges in the political and economic environment, notably:\n\u2022 in 2016 a US$2 billion \"black hole\" was discovered in Mozambique's public finances; this had immediate (IMF suspended its investment programme and other international lenders and donors ceased working in Mozambique) and longer-term impacts on the country's economy, contributing to more challenging trading conditions;\n\u2022 in 2018 there was a significant outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Mozambique which had a severely negative impact on Mozbife's ability to operate and trade as planned;\n\u2022 during 2019, cyclones Idai and Kenneth resulted in significant damage and flooding to large areas of Mozambique, further impacting the already weakened economy;\n\u2022 in 2020 the COVID pandemic severely impacted the operating environment in Mozambique;\n\u2022 ongoing security issues in the north of Mozambique, which have stalled the anticipated development of significant gas projects; and the recent presidential election have had a detrimental effect on businesses operating in Mozambique;\n\u2022 the high cost of obtaining financing from banks to fund trading operations (which, in turn, led to the Company obtaining working capital from Chepstow);\n\u2022 the inability for the Mozambique Agricultural Businesses to generate sufficient revenues in order to enable the Company to repay the debt to Chepstow or to invest into growing its operations;\n\u2022 the lack of interest in the sale process of the Mozambique Agricultural Businesses' farms at Nyazonia, Dombe and/or Mavonde; and the costs of maintaining a public listing which are proving disproportionate to the underlying revenue generation of the Mozambique Agricultural Businesses.\nIt is noted that Chepstow, as the Company's principal source of financing, has, to date, deferred interest payments, extended maturity dates and provided further finance to the Company, as needed. That said, the Directors understand that this could not be expected to continue indefinitely, and that action therefore had to be taken to address the situation, particularly as, the Directors do not believe there is a realistic prospect of securing debt finance on reasonable terms from an external lender to refinance the existing debt position with Chepstow.\nAdditionally, given the current depressed state of the equity markets, particularly for micro-cap companies, the Directors believe, having consulted with their advisers that securing the equity investment to refinance the existing debt and finance operational growth would be very difficult to achieve. In any event, the Directors believe that there is a high likelihood that unless the indebtedness to Chepstow could be settled in full, any additional investment would only extend the status quo and would not be sufficient to enable the Mozambique Agricultural Businesses to achieve profitable growth or to become self-sustaining without continued support.\nAs noted in the Disposal Circular on 10th March 2025 the Directors believe that, given the financial position of the Company, the interests of the Mozambique Agricultural Businesses and its stakeholders will be best served outside the public arena and without the considerable cost, management time and the legal and regulatory burden associated with maintaining the Company's AIM quotation. Consequently, the Directors consider that the interests of Shareholders and other stakeholders will be best served by undertaking the Disposal.\nAs announced on 8 August 2025, the long stop date for completion of the Disposal has been extended by agreement with Chepstow to 31 March 2026. The requirement for this extension arises from unexpected delays in the process of obtaining the necessary local regulatory approvals in Mozambique. Approval has been received from the Competition Regulatory Authority and is awaited from the Bank of Mozambique. On 27 January 2026, the Company announced amendments to the disposal agreement to reflect direction from the Bank of Mozambique. The long stop date for approval has been deferred to 31 March 2026.\nFollowing receipt of these regulatory approvals and completion of the Disposal, the Company will continue to be quoted on AIM as an AIM Rule 15 cash shell which the Directors hope will provide opportunities to create and deliver enhanced shareholder returns.\nThe Company continues to observe the principles of the QCA Corporate Governance Code (the \"Code\") to the extent that they consider them to be applicable and appropriate for a group of PACSCo's size and stage of development, through the maintenance of efficient and effective management frameworks accompanied by good communication.\nRisk management\nThe Group is subject to various risks, and the future outlook for the Group and growth in shareholder value should be viewed with an understanding of these risks. The following table shows the principal risks facing the Group and the actions taken to mitigate these:\nKey risk factor\nDetail\nHow it is managed\nChange in the period\nRegulatory approval of the Disposal is not received\nThe Disposal is contingent upon approval from the Competition authorities and the Bank of Mozambique.\nLocal legal counsel has prepared and submitted the applications and believe that approvals are of an administrative rather than substantive nature.\nNew\nAvailability of working capital\nThe Company requires sufficient working capital to remain as an AIM Rule 15 cash shell.\nAs part of the Disposal, Chepstow have agreed to provide a working capital facility, to enable the Company to seek suitable alternative investments.\nNew\nTime to secure and fund an investment opportunity under AIM Rule 15\nIf the Company is unable to identify and fund an appropriate investment opportunity within the 6-month deadline from the completion of the Disposal, then trading in the Company's shares will be suspended, leading to a possible delisting.\nThe Board are reviewing the future investment strategy and will be implemented once the Disposal has been completed.\nNew\nThe Board is also responsible for establishing and monitoring the Group's systems of internal controls. Although no system of internal control can provide absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss, the Group's systems are designed to provide the directors with reasonable assurance that problems are identified on a timely basis and dealt with appropriately. The Board reviews the effectiveness of the systems of internal control and considers the major business risks and the control environment on a regular basis. In light of this control environment the Board considers that there is no current requirement for a permanent separate internal audit function.\nGoing concern\nDetails of the consideration of going concern are set out in note 3. The Group has prepared forecasts on the basis that the Disposal will complete covering the period of 12 (twelve) months from the date of approval of these financial statements. These forecasts are based on assumptions including,\ninter\nalia the working capital facility of \u00a3750,000 committed by Chepstow, that a suitable investment opportunity will be identified and negotiations concluded within 12 (twelve) months of the completion of the disposal as provided under AIM Rule 15. To date \u00a3253,000 has been drawn under this facility.\nThese financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the Group was unable to continue as a going concern.\nBoard and senior management changes\nThere were no changes in the Board and Senior Management during the year.\nCSO Havers,\nNon-Executive Chair\n30 January 2026\n1\nCorporate Governance\nThe Company is quoted on AIM and is required to comply with the provisions of a recognised corporate governance code.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS\nAdditional information on the Company can be found on the Company's website at\nwww.PACSCo-ltd.com\n. The site is currently under development pending completion of the transaction.\nThe maintenance and integrity of the Company's website is the responsibility of the Directors; the work carried out by the auditor does not involve consideration of these matters and accordingly, the auditor accepts no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the financial statements since they were initially presented on the website.\nThe Company's website is compliant with AIM Rule 26.\nBy Order of the Board.\nCSO Havers\nNon-Executive Chair\n30 January 2026\nStatement of Directors' responsibilities\nThe Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors' Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.\nThe Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008, as amended (the '2008 Law') requires the Directors to prepare\nGroup\nfinancial statements for each financial year in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nThe Directors are required by the AIM Rules for Companies of the London Stock Exchange to prepare\nGroup\nfinancial statements in accordance with International Accounting Standards as adopted by the United Kingdom ('UK')\nThe financial statements of the\nGroup\nare required by law to give a true and fair view and are required by International Accounting Standards as adopted by the United Kingdom to present fairly the financial position and financial performance of the\nGroup\n.\nIn preparing the\nGroup\nfinancial statements, the Directors are required to:\n- select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;\n- make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;\n- state whether they have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standards as adopted by the United Kingdom; and\n- prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the\nGroup\nwill continue in business.\nThe Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the\nGroup\ntransactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the\nGroup\nand enable them to ensure that the financial statements are properly prepared in accordance with the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008.\u00a0They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the\nGroup\nand hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\nThe Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the\nCompany's\nwebsite. Legislation in Guernsey governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\nThe Directors confirm they have discharged their responsibilities as noted above.\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF PACSCO LIMITED (formerly known as Agriterra Limited)\nOpinion\nWe have audited the group financial statements of PACSCo Limited (the 'group') (formerly known as Agriterra Limited) for the year ended 31 March 2025 which comprise the Consolidated Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and notes to the financial statements, including significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and UK-adopted international accounting standards.\nIn our opinion, the group financial statements:\n\u00b7\ngive a true and fair view of the state of the group's affairs as at 31 March 2025 and of its loss for the year then ended;\n\u00b7\nhave been properly prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards; and\n\u00b7\nhave been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008.\nBasis for opinion\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the group in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\nConclusions relating to going concern\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the directors' assessment of the group's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n\u00b7\nreviewing management's going concern memorandum assessment, discussing and challenging management regarding the future and availability of funding;\n\u00b7\nreviewing the cash flow forecasts for the ensuing twelve months from the date of approval of these group financial statements and assessment thereof;\n\u00b7\nperforming sensitivity analysis on the cash flow forecast prepared by management, and challenging the assumptions included thereto; and\n\u00b7\nreviewing the adequacy and completeness of disclosures in the group financial statements.\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.\nOur application of materiality\nFor the purposes of determining whether the group financial statements are free from material misstatement, we define materiality as a magnitude of misstatement, including omission, that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person, relying on the group financial statements, would be changed, or influenced. We have also considered those misstatements including omissions that would be material by nature and would impact the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person based our understanding of the business, industry and complexity involved.\nWe apply the concept of materiality both in planning and throughout the course of the audit, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements. Materiality is used to determine the group financial statements areas that are included within the scope of our audit and the extent of sample sizes during the audit.\nWe also determine a level of performance materiality which we use to assess the extent of testing needed to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality for the group financial statements as a whole.\nIn determining materiality and performance materiality, we considered the following factors:\n\u00b7\nour cumulative knowledge of the group and its environment, including industry specific trends;\n\u00b7\nthe change in the level of judgement required in respect of the key accounting estimates;\n\u00b7\nsignificant transactions during the year;\n\u00b7\nthe stability in key management personnel; and\n\u00b7\nthe level of misstatements identified in prior periods.\nMateriality for the group financial statements was set at $179,000 (2024: $180,000). This was calculated based on 1.5% (2024: 1.75%) of revenue for the year. Using our professional judgement, we have determined this to be the principal benchmark within the group financial statements as it is most relevant to stakeholders in assessing the financial performance of the group as the key focus of the group is to grow its business to meet its working capital needs by increasing revenue from operations and considering that the disposal of the Mozambique subsidiaries only occurred at year end.\nPerformance materiality for the group financial statements was set at $125,000 (2024: $126,000) being 70% of materiality for the group financial statements. 70% is considered appropriate based on our assessment that there is low to medium risk that the group financial statements could be materially misstated.\nFor each component in scope for our audit, we allocated a performance materiality based on the relative revenue contribution of each component to the group revenue and aggregation risk. In instances where the in-scope component did not generate revenue, the performance materiality for that component entity was computed using ~20% of group performance materiality. The range of performance materiality allocated across components was between $22,000 (2024: $36,000) to $100,000 (2024: $160,000).\nWe agreed to report to those charged with governance all corrected and uncorrected misstatements we identified through our audit with a value in excess of $8,900 (2024: $9,000). We also agreed to report any other audit misstatements below that threshold that we believe warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.\nNo significant changes have come to light during the audit which required a revision to our materiality for the group financial statements as a whole.\nOur approach to the audit\nOur audit was risk based and was designed to focus our efforts on the areas at greatest risk of material misstatement, aspects subject to significant management judgement as well as greatest complexity, risk and size. In designing our audit, we determined materiality, as above, and assessed the risk of material misstatement in the financial statements. We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed sufficient work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements, considering the structure of the Group.\nThe Group included the listed parent company, one subsidiary based in Guernsey and five subsidiaries based in Mozambique. At year end, the group divested one subsidiary based in Guernsey and five subsidiaries based in Mozambique.\nOut of the seven components, two were dormant and five were trading components (listed parent company in Guernsey and four subsidiaries in Mozambique).\nEach component was assessed as to whether they were material to the Group based on either their size or risk. Based on the assessment, we have performed the full scope audit on the listed parent company that is registered in Guernsey. The four components in Mozambique have been subject to full scope audits by a component auditor.\nThe group's accounting function is based in Mozambique. As group auditor, we maintained oversight and regular contact with the component auditor throughout all stages of the audit, and we were responsible for the scope and direction of their work.\nIn designing our audit, we considered those areas which were deemed to involve significant judgement and estimation by the directors, such as the key audit matter surrounding the accounting for discontinued operations and going concern assessment in the group financial statements. We also addressed the risk of management override of controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. Procedures were then performed to address the risks identified.\nKey audit matters\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) we identified, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\nKey Audit Matter\nHow our scope addressed this matter\nAccounting and presentation of divestment of Mozambique Operations (see Note 4 and 11)\nPACSCo Limited divested of its Mozambique based agricultural business on 31 March 2025. As at the year end the sale was still subject to regulatory approvals. However, PACSCo Limited had ceded control of this business and as such accounted for the divestment at the year end. The divestment of the business was made to the largest shareholder of PACSCo Limited, Chepstow Investments Limited.\nThis is considered to be a key audit matter due to:-\no\nthe material nature of the transaction;\no\nthe transaction with Chepstow Investments Limited is a related party transaction requiring scrutiny of terms and disclosures;\no\nuse of judgement by the management to account for sale pending regulatory approvals; and\no\ncomplexity around accounting and presentation.\nOur work in this area included (including component file review):\n\u00d8\nReviewing underlying sale documents, shareholders' approval and regulatory filings;\n\u00d8\nReviewing and challenging management's assessment on whether the sale of the Mozambique operations meet the definition of loss of control, pending regulatory approval, under IFRS 10-Consolidated - financial statements;\n\u00d8\nReviewing legal opinion obtained by management in their determination that the regulatory approvals are administrative in nature and challenging the aforementioned;\n\u00d8\nReviewing board minutes and board composition of Mozambique operations to corroborate change in control;\n\u00d8\nReviewed and challenging management's assessment that the sale transaction with a related party was at arm's length;\n\u00d8\nReviewing and challenging management's computation of loss on sale and corroborating the net assets disposed of to the work performed by the component auditor; and\n\u00d8\nReviewing and challenging the presentation and disclosure in the financial statements to ensure that it is in line with accounting standards.\nDuring the year, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its investment in all its subsidiary and indirect subsidiaries representing the Mozambique agricultural businesses to Chepstow Investment Limited (\"CIL\"), subject to obtaining regulatory approvals. The sale was approved by the Company's shareholders on 31 March 2025.\nManagement has accounted for the sale as at 31 March 2025 based on the following considerations:\n\u00b7\nRegulatory approvals outstanding are considered administrative in nature, supported by a legal opinion from Mozambique\u2011based counsel.\n\u00b7\nControl of the subsidiaries had effectively transferred to CIL, as CIL had appointed directors responsible for key strategic decision\u2011making.\nAs of the date of this report, regulatory approval from the Bank of Mozambique remains pending. Management has indicated that it currently has no reason to believe that the approval will be withheld.\nOther information\nThe other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. Our opinion on the group financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\nMatters on which we are required to report by exception\nIn the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors' report.\nWe have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies (Guernsey) Law, 2008 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\u00b7\nadequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n\u00b7\nthe group financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\n\u00b7\nwe have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.\nResponsibilities of directors\nAs explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the group financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\nIn preparing the group financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\nAuditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below:\n\u00b7\nWe obtained an understanding of the group and the industry in which it operates to identify laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a direct effect on the group financial statements. We obtained our understanding in this regard through discussions with management and the application of our cumulative audit knowledge and experience of the industry.\n\u00b7\nWe determined the principal laws and regulations relevant to the group in this regard to be those arising from AIM Listing Rules, QCA Corporate Governance Code, Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008, UK-adopted international accounting standards, local Employment Laws, local Health and Safety Regulations, local Tax Laws and other local laws and regulations in Mozambique. The team remained alert to instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout the audit.\n\u00b7\nWe designed our audit procedures to ensure the audit team considered whether there were any indications of non-compliance by the group with those laws and regulations. These procedures included but were not limited to: making enquiries of management and legal counsel; discussion with component auditor about compliance with laws and regulations in Mozambique; review of minutes of meetings; review of legal and professional ledger accounts and review of the Regulatory News Service announcements.\n\u00b7\nWe also identified the risks of material misstatement of the group financial statements due to fraud. We considered, in addition to the non-rebuttable presumption of a risk of fraud arising from management override of controls and revenue recognition, inappropriate application of the going concern assumption in the preparation of group financial statements and management bias in determining key accounting judgments in relation to key audit matter. We addressed this by challenging the estimates/judgements made by management when auditing these significant accounting estimates/judgements (refer to the Key audit matter and Going concern section).\n\u00b7\nAs in all of our audits, we addressed the risk of fraud arising from management override of controls by performing audit procedures which included, but were not limited to: the testing of journals; reviewing key accounting estimates/judgements for evidence of bias (Refer to the Key audit matter and Going concern sections); and evaluating the business rationale of any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business.\n\u00b7\nOur review of non-compliance with laws and regulations included the listed parent entity. The component auditors were used for significant components. The risk of actual or suspected non-compliance was not sufficiently significant to our audit to result in our response being identified as a key audit matter.\nBecause of the inherent limitations of an audit, there is a risk that we will not detect all irregularities, including those leading to a material misstatement in the financial statements or non-compliance with regulation. This risk increases the more that compliance with a law or regulation is removed from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, as we will be less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance. The risk is also greater regarding irregularities occurring due to fraud rather than error, as fraud involves intentional concealment, forgery, collusion, omission or misrepresentation.\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's website at:\nwww.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities\n. This description forms part of our auditor's report.\nUse of our report\nThis report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with our engagement letter dated 29 September 2025. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone, other than the company and the company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\nTimothy Harris (Engagement Partner)\n15 Westferry Circus\nFor and on behalf of PKF Littlejohn LLP\nCanary Wharf\nRegistered Auditor\nLondon E14 4HD\n30 January

GeNERAL INFORMATION\nPACSCo is incorporated and domiciled in Guernsey, the Channel Islands, with registered number 42643. Further details, including the address of the registered office, are given on page 47. The nature of the Group's operations and its principal activities are set out in the Directors' report. A list of the investments in subsidiaries and associate companies held directly and indirectly by the Company during the year and at the year-end, including the name, country of incorporation, operation and ownership interest is given in note 3.\nThe reporting currency for the Group is the US Dollar ('$' or 'US$') as it most appropriately reflects the Group's business activities in the agricultural sector in Africa and therefore the Group's financial position and financial performance.\nThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standards as adopted by the United Kingdom. Following the change of control of the Agricultural businesses in Mozambique, the operating activities were deconsolidated at 31 March 2025, and disclosed as discontinued activities. The comparatives have been restated accordingly. The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the following items, which are measured at an alternative basis on each reporting date:\nItems\nMeasurement basis\nBiological assets\nFair value\nProperty, plant and equipment - Land and building\nSubsequent measured at revalued amount - i.e., fair value at the date of revaluation less subsequent depreciation and impairment losses.\n2.\nADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS\nAdoption of new and revised Standards\nDuring the current year, the Group has adopted all of the new and revised standards and interpretations issued by the IASB and the IFRS-IC that are relevant to its operations and effective for annual reporting periods beginning on 1 April 2024. The revised standards and interpretations have not resulted in material changes to the Group's accounting policies.\nThe following new and amended standards are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group's financial statements in the future, being FY 2026.\nNew standard issued IFRS 18\nPresentation\nand Disclosure in\nFinancial Statements:\nNew standard replaces IAS 1 with focus on statement of profit or loss, adding new principles of aggregation and disaggregation of items.\nNew standard issued IFRS 19 Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: New standard allows subsidiaries without Public Accountability to apply reduced set of disclosures in their financial statements, replacing the extensive requirements of full IFRS.\nAmendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7\nClassification\nand Measurement\nof Financial Instruments\n: Classification of financial assets and settlement by electronic payments.\n3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for certain financial instruments, biological assets, property, plant and equipment and share based payments. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets acquired. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below in this note.\nGoing concern\nThe Company has prepared forecasts for the Group's ongoing businesses covering the period of 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements. These forecasts are based on assumptions including,\ninter alia\n, the working capital facility of \u00a3750,000 committed by Chepstow (of which \u00a3253,000 has been drawn to date), and that the disposal of the Group's Agricultural Businesses will receive regulatory consent. Accordingly, only forecasts for the Company have been prepared and it has been assumed that the budgeted cash flows can be achieved and that the existing working capital facility will remain in place for the forecast period.\nThe directors are confident that the Group will achieve its cash flow forecasts. Therefore, the directors have prepared the financial statements on a going concern basis.\nBasis of consolidation\nThe Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when the acquired set of activities and assets meets the definition of a business and control is transferred to the Group. In determining whether a particular set of activities and assets is a business, the Group assesses whether the set of assets and activities acquired includes, at a minimum, an input and substantive process and whether the acquired set has the ability to produce outputs.\nThe consideration transferred in the acquisition is generally measured at fair value, as are the identifiable net assets acquired. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment. Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognised in profit or loss immediately. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if related to the issue of debt or equity securities.\nWhere control over the operating activities of a subsidiary ceases, the subsidiary is deconsolidated and disclosed as discontinued activities.\nSubsidiaries\nSubsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group 'controls' an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through power over the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which controls ceases.\nIntra-Group transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.\nDuring the year ended 31 March 2025, the Company held equity interests in the following undertakings:\nDirect investments\nProportion held of equity instruments\nCountry of incorporation and place of business\nNature of business\nSubsidiary undertakings\nAgriterra (Mozambique) Limited\n100%\nGuernsey\nHolding company\nIndirect investments of Agriterra (Mozambique) Limited\nProportion held of equity instruments\nCountry of incorporation and place of business\nNature of business\nSubsidiary undertakings\nDECA - Desenvolvimento E Comercializa\u00e7\u00e3o Agr\u00edcola Limitada\n100%\nMozambique\nGrain\nCompagri Limitada\n100%\nMozambique\nGrain\nMozbife Limitada\n100%\nMozambique\nBeef\nCarnes de Manica Limitada\n100%\nMozambique\nDormant\nAgriterra Avia\u00e7\u00e3o imitada\n100%\nMozambique\nDormant\nDeca Snax Limitada\n50%\nMozambique\nMaize based food products\nThese investments were conditionally disposed of on 31 March 2025 and were de-consolidated on 31 March 2025.\nForeign currency\nThe individual financial statements of each company in the Group are prepared in Mozambican Metical, the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates (its 'functional currency'). The consolidated financial statements are presented in US Dollars as the Group's principal finance facilities and the terms of the disposal agreement are expressed in US Dollars.\nIn preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entity's functional currency (foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.\nFor the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group's operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the year, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during the year, in which case exchange rates at the date of transactions are used. Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations and overseas branches are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity in the translation reserve. Such translation differences are recognised as income or expense in the year in which the operation or branch is disposed of.\nThe following are the material exchange rates applied by the Group:\nAverage Rate\nClosing Rate\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nMozambican Metical: US$\n63.90\n63.89\n63.90\n63.90\nOperating segments\nThe Chief Operating Decision Maker is the Board. The Board reviews the Group's internal reporting in order to assess the performance of the business.\nAs the operating businesses were disposed of on 31 March 2025, the Mozambique Agricultural Businesses have been deemed to be one operating segment and disclosed as discontinued activities.\nRevenue recognition\nRevenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, value added taxes and other sales related taxes.\nPerformance obligations and timing of revenue recognition:\nAll of the Group's revenue is derived from selling goods with revenue recognised at a point in time when control of the goods has transferred to the customer. This is generally when the goods are collected by or delivered to the customer. There is limited judgement needed in identifying the point control passes once physical delivery of the products to the agreed location has occurred, the Group no longer has\nphysical possession, usually it will have a present right to payment. Consideration is received in accordance with agreed terms of sale.\nDetermining the contract price:\nAll of the Group's revenue is derived from fixed price lists and therefore the amount of revenue to be earned from each transaction is determined by reference to those fixed prices.\nAllocating amounts to performance obligations:\nFor most sales, there is a fixed unit price for each product sold. Therefore, there is no judgement involved in allocating the price to each unit ordered.\nThere are no long-term contracts in place. Sales commissions are expensed as incurred. No practical expedients are used.\nOperating loss\nOperating loss is stated before other gains and losses, finance costs and taxation.\nBorrowing costs\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial year of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. The Group did not incur any borrowing costs in respect of qualifying assets in any year presented.\nAll other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the year in which they are incurred.\nShare based payments\nThe Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees of the Group and in settlement of certain expenditure. These payments are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of non-market based vesting conditions) at the date of grant and the value is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company's estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for non-market based vesting conditions.\nFair value is measured by use of the Black Scholes model. The expected life used in the model is adjusted, based on management's best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.\nEmployee benefits\nShort-term employee benefits\nShort-term employee benefits include salaries and wages, short-term compensated absences and bonus payments. The Group recognises a liability and corresponding expense for short-term employee benefits when an employee has rendered services that entitle him/her to the benefit.\nPost-employment benefits\nThe Group does not contribute to any retirement plan for its employees. Social security payments to state schemes are charged to profit and loss as the employee's services are rendered.\nTaxation\nThe Company is resident for taxation purposes in Guernsey, and its income is subject to income tax, presently at a rate of zero per cent per annum. The income of overseas subsidiaries is subject to tax at the prevailing rate in each jurisdiction.\nThe income tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity when tax is recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity as appropriate. Taxable profit differs from accounting profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.\nCurrent tax expense is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year. It is calculated on the basis of the tax laws and rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and includes any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Deferred tax is calculated using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the asset can be utilised. This requires judgements to be made in respect of the availability of future taxable income.\nThe Group's deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the liability is settled, or the asset realised based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset only when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.\nNo deferred tax asset or liability is recognised in respect of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches and joint ventures where the Group is able to control the timing of reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\nProperty, plant and equipment\nRecognition\nItems of property, plant and equipment are stated at historical purchase cost. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable to bringing the assets to a working condition for their intended use, the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located and borrowing costs on qualifying assets.\nSubsequent expenditure\nSubsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\nSubsequent measurement\nFollowing initial recognition at cost, items of land and buildings are subsequently measured using the revaluation model being the fair value at the date of revaluation less any subsequent depreciation and subsequent impairment losses. The revaluation model is only used when fair value can be reliably measured. Revaluations are made regularly enough to ensure that at any reporting date the carrying amount does not differ materially from the fair value. Revaluations are performed by independent sworn valuators triennially. When an item of property, plant and equipment is revalued, the entire class of property, plant, and equipment to which the asset belongs is revalued. Only land and buildings are subsequently valued using the revaluation model and all others are valued at cost model.\nAny revaluation surplus is credited to revaluation reserve as part of other comprehensive income, except to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognized in the profit or loss, in which case the increase is recognized in the profit or loss. A revaluation deficit is recognized in profit or loss, except to the extent that it offsets an existing surplus on the same recognized in the asset revaluation reserve. The revaluation reserve is realized over the period of the useful life of the property by transferring the realized portion from the revaluation reserve to retained earnings.\nDepreciation\nDepreciation is charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each item, as follows:\nLand and buildings:\nLand\nNil\nBuildings and leasehold improvements\n2%\n- 33%\nPlant and machinery\n5%\n- 25%\nMotor vehicles\n20%\n- 25%\nOther assets\n10%\n- 33%\nThe assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds received with the carrying amount of the asset immediately prior to disposal and are included in profit and loss.\nIntangible assets and goodwill\nIntangible assets comprise\ninvestment in management information and financial software. This is amortised at 10% straight line. Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.\nImpairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\nAt each balance sheet date, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.\nRecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised initially against amounts included in the revaluation reserve in respect of the asset and subsequently in\nprofit and loss.\nWhere an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in\nprofit and loss\n.\nBiological assets\nConsumer biological assets, being the beef cattle herd, are measured in accordance with IAS 41,\n'Agriculture'\nat fair value less costs to sell, with gains and losses in the measurement to fair value recorded in profit and loss. Breeding cattle, comprising bulls, cows and heifers are expected to be held for more than one year, and are classified as non-current assets. The non-breeding cattle comprise animals that will be grown and sold for slaughter and are classified as current assets.\nCattle are recorded as assets at the year-end and the fair value is determined by the size of the herd and market prices at the reporting date.\nCattle cease to be a biological asset from the point they are slaughtered, after which they are accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy below for inventories.\nForage crops are valued in accordance with IAS 41,\n'Agriculture'\nat fair value less costs to harvest. As there is no ready local market for forage crops, fair value is calculated by reference to the production costs of previous crops. The cost of forage is charged to profit or loss over the year it is consumed.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses. The cost of inventories is based on the weighted average principle and includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition.\nFinancial instruments\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Group's balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\nFinancial assets\nFinancial assets are classified as either financial assets at amortised cost, at fair value through other comprehensive income (\"FVTOCI\") or at fair value through profit or loss (\"FVPL\") depending upon the business model for managing the financial assets and the nature of the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.\nA loss allowance for expected credit losses is determined for all financial assets, other than those at FVPL, at the end of each reporting period. The Group applies a simplified approach to measure the credit loss allowance for trade receivables using the lifetime expected credit loss provision. The lifetime expected credit loss is evaluated for each trade receivable taking into account payment history, payments made subsequent to year-end and prior to reporting, past default experience and the impact of any other relevant and current observable data. The Group applies a general approach on all other receivables classified as financial assets. The general approach recognises lifetime expected credit losses when there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.\nThe Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another party. The Group derecognises financial liabilities when the Group's obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired.\nTrade and other receivables\nTrade receivables are accounted for at amortised cost. Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate expected credit loss allowances for estimated recoverable amounts as the interest that would be recognised from discounting future cash payments over the short payment period is not considered to be material. Other receivables are accounted for at amortised cost and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate expected credit loss allowances.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents, comprise cash on hand, on demand deposits and cash equivalents, which are short term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into a known amount of cash, and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\nFinancial liabilities\nThe classification of financial liabilities at initial recognition depends on the purpose for which the financial liability was issued and its characteristics.\nAll purchases of financial liabilities are recorded on trade date, being the date on which the Group becomes party to the contractual requirements of the financial liability. Unless otherwise indicated the carrying amounts of the Group's financial liabilities approximate to their fair values.\nThe Group's financial liabilities consist of financial liabilities measured at amortised cost and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.\nA financial liability (in whole or in part) is derecognised when the Group has extinguished its contractual obligations, it expires or is cancelled. Any gain or loss on derecognition is taken to the statement of comprehensive income.\nBorrowings\nBorrowings are included as financial liabilities on the Group balance sheet at the amounts drawn on the particular facilities net of the unamortised cost of financing. Interest payable on those facilities is expensed as finance cost in the period to which it relates.\nTrade and other payables\nTrade and other payables are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost.\nFair value measurement\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nThe fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Company.\nThe fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.\nFor all other financial instruments not traded in an active market, the fair value is determined by using valuation techniques deemed to be appropriate in the circumstances. Valuation techniques include the market approach (i.e., using recent arm's length market transactions adjusted as necessary and reference to the current market value of another instrument that is substantially the same) and the income approach (i.e., discounted cash flow analysis and option pricing models making as much use of available and supportable market data as possible).\nAll assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:\nLevel 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.\nLevel 3 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.\nFor assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing the categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting year.\n4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY\nIn the application of the Group's accounting policies which are described in note\n3\n, the directors are required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nGoing concern\nDetails of the directors' assessment of Going Concern are set out in note 3.\nThese financial statements do not include the adjustments that would result if the Group were unable to continue as a going concern.\nDisposal of Agricultural Businesses in Mozambique\nAt a General Meeting held on 31 March 2025, the shareholders approved resolutions to dispose of the Group's Mozambique Agricultural Businesses to Chepstow. The Disposal is conditional upon receiving certain local Mozambican regulatory approvals. The Board consider these approvals (one of which is still outstanding) to be administrative rather than substantive in nature. Furthermore, the Disposal agreement specifically provides that the Company has no further role in managing the Mozambican businesses nor does it share any financial interest in returns from the businesses disposed of. The Board therefore considers that as at 31 March 2025 it no longer controlled the Mozambique operations and has accounted for the transaction as a disposal on 31 March 2025. Accordingly, the trading results for the year ended 31 March 2025 have been disclosed as discontinued activities and the comparatives for the year ended 31 March 2024 have been restated. No segmental reporting disclosures have been made as the remaining continuing activities relate solely to the Company.\n5.\nOperating loss\nOperating loss on continuing activities has been arrived at after charging / (crediting):\nRestated\nYear\nended\nYear\nended\n31 March 2025\n31 March 2024\nUS$000\nUS$000\nContinuing activities\nStaff costs\n8\n8\nDiscontinued Activities\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment (see note 13)\n795\n868\nAmortisation of intangible asset (see note 14)\n-\n3\nProfit on disposal of property, plant and equipment\n119\n30\nNet foreign exchange loss\n100\n54\nStaff costs (see note 7)\n1,475\n1,382\n6.

No tax is payable for the year. Deferred tax has not been provided for, as brought forward tax losses are not recoverable under the Income Tax (Zero 10) (Guernsey) Law, 2007 (as amended).\n11. Discontinued activities\nOn 31 March 2025, shareholders approved the disposal of the Company's Mozambique Agricultural Businesses to Chepstow. The rationale for the transaction is set out in the Strategic report. Following the transfer of control to Chepstow on 31 March 2025, these businesses were deconsolidated and their activities disclosed as discontinued activities. The comparatives have been adjusted accordingly. The consideration received was the waiver of shareholder loans and other liabilities to Chepstow amounting to $15,281,000. The book value of the net assets disposed of amounted to $25,648,000.\nYear\nended\nYear\nended\n31 March\n2025\n31 March 2024\nNote\nUS$000\nUS$000\nRevenue\n13,591\n10,393\nCost of sales\n(10,985)\n(8,124)\nDecrease in fair value of biological assets\n(90)\n(437)\nGross profit\n2,516\n1,832\nOperating expenses\n(3,138)\n(3,577)\nOther income\n135\n273\nProfit on disposal of property, plant and equipment\n119\n30\nOperating loss\n(368)\n(1,442)\nFinance costs\n9\n(331)\n(485)\nLoss before taxation on discontinued activities\n(699)\n(1,927)\nLoss on disposal of discontinued activities\n(26,531)\n-\n(27,230)\n(1,927)\nTaxation\n10\n127\n127\nLoss for the year on discontinued activities\n(27,103)\n(1,800)\nOther comprehensive loss\nItems that will not be reclassified to profit or loss:\nRevaluation of property, plant and equipment\n-\n(141)\nRelated tax\n-\n45\n-\n(96)\nItems that may be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss:\nForeign exchange translation differences\n16,164\n5\nTotal comprehensive loss for the year\n(10,939)\n(1,891)\nThe loss on disposal of discontinued activities is arrived at as follows:\n31 March\n2025\n31 March 2024\nUS$000\nUS$000\nWaiver of balances due to Chepstow (includes shareholder loans and other payables)\n15,281\n-\nNet assets disposed\n(25,648)\n-\nLoss before recycling of foreign currency translation reserve\n(10,367)\n-\nRecycle of foreign currency translation reserve on disposal\n(16,164)\n-\nTotal loss on disposal\n(26,531)\n-\nThe net assets disposed of comprise:\nYear ended\n31 March\n2025\nUS$000\nProperty plant and equipment\n24,508\nBiological assets\n231\nInventory\n1,311\nTrade and other receivables\n944\nCash\n290\nTrade and other payables\n(1,200)\nBorrowings\n(436)\nNet Assets disposed of\n25,648\nThe balance on the revaluation reserve of US$17,524,000 was credited directly to retained earnings rather than recycling through the income statement in accordance with IAS 16-\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\n.\n12.

In accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards, such revaluation exercises should be performed regularly. The Group adopted a policy to revalue land and buildings after every 3 years.\nAt the triennial valuation of land and building at 31 March 2024 the Group revalued land and buildings down by $141,087 (31 March 2021: revalued up by $18,475,127) in total (DECA revalued down by $274,923, Compagri revalued down by $124,935 and Mozbife revalued up by $258,771). This valuation attributed a value of $nil to the farms, which are currently held for sale. The carrying value of land and buildings at 31 March 2025 under the cost model would have been $nil (2024: $ 4,735,908).\nThe valuation of the land and building was carried out by a certified valuer. The valuation was based on replacement cost method wherein the valuer estimated the cost of building a similar infrastructure taking into account inflation, cost of constructions, land value and return on investments. These inputs are Level 3 inputs as per the fair value hierarchy as they are unobservable inputs. The fair value is sensitive to these inputs and changes to one or more inputs can significantly impact the fair value.\nProperty, plant and equipment with a carrying amount of $nil (2024: $6,085,415) have been pledged to secure the Group's bank overdrafts and loans (note 18). The Group is not allowed to pledge these assets as security for other borrowings or sell them to another entity.\nFor the year ended 31 March 2025, a depreciation charge o\nf $795,000\n(2024: $868,000) has been included in the consolidated income statement within discontinued activities. Certain motor vehicles and equipment have been purchased with finance leases.\n14.

They are generally due for settlement within 30 days and therefore are all classified as current. Trade receivables are recognised initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditional. The Group holds the trade receivables with the objective to collect the contractual cash flows and therefore measures them subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\nOther receivables include receivable from shareholder for services to or expenses incurred on behalf of the shareholder US$210,000 (2024:US$176,118)\nThe Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on the days past due.\nAt 31 March 2024\nTrade receivables\nCurrent\nMore than 30 days\nMore than 60 Days\nMore than 90 days\nTotal\nUS$000\nUS$000\nUS$000\nUS$000\nUS$000\nExpected loss rate\n0%\n0%\n0%\n70%\n8%\nGross trade receivables\n617\n150\n85\n104\n956\nLoss allowance\n-\n-\n-\n73\n73\nThe closing loss allowances for trade receivables as at 31 March reconcile to the opening loss allowances as follows:\n31 March\n2025\n31 March\n2024\nUS$000\nUS$000\nLoss allowances at 1 April\n73\n22\nIncrease in loss allowance recognised in profit or loss on discontinued activities during the year\n-\n51\nOn disposal of discontinued activities\n(73)\n-\nExchange rate adjustment\n-\n-\nLoss allowances at 31 March\n-\n73\nTrade receivables are provided for when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Indicators that there is no reasonable expectation of recovery include, amongst others, the failure of a debtor to engage in a repayment plan with the Group, and a failure to make contractual payments for a period of greater than 120 days past due. This is used as the basis of the ECL provision disclosed above. The Group determines the percentage based on historic trends. Impairment losses on trade receivables are presented as net impairment losses within operating profit. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the same line item.\nFurther details on the Group's financial assets are provided in note\n21\n.\n18.\nBorrowings\n31 March 2025\n31 March 2024\nUS$000\nUS$000\nNon-current liabilities\nShareholder loans\n-\n13,637\nBank loans\n-\n501\n-\n14,138\n-\nCurrent liabilities\nBank loans\n-\n130\n-\n130\n-\n14,268\nReconciliation to cash flow statement\nAt 31 March 2024\nCash flow\nInterest accrued\nOn disposal of subsidiaries\nForeign Exchange\nAt 31 March 2025\nUS$000\nUS$000\nUS$000\nUS$000\nUS$000\nUS$000\nShareholder loans\n13,637\n-\n1,386\n(15,023)\n-\n-\nBank loans (discontinued)\n631\n(526)\n331\n(436)\n-\n-\n14,268\n(526)\n1,717\n(15,459)\n-\n-\nAt 31 March 2023\nCash flow\nInterest accrued\nLoan to equity conversion\nForeign Exchange\nAt 31 March 2024\nUS$000\nUS$000\nUS$000\nUS$000\nUS$000\nUS$000\nShareholder loans\n8,034\n4,600\n1,003\n-\n-\n13,637\nNon-current bank loans\n574\n(72)\n-\n(1)\n501\nNon-current leases\n88\n(88)\n-\n-\n-\nCurrent bank loans\n1,056\n(868)\n-\n(58)\n130\nCurrent leases\n110\n(110)\n-\n-\n-\n9,862\n3,462\n1,003\n-\n(59)\n14,268\n19.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n20.1.\nCapital risk management\nFollowing the disposal of the Group's trading operations, the Company manages its capital to ensure that it will be able to continue as going concern whilst it seeks investment opportunities to provide future returns to shareholders.\n20.2.\nCategories of financial instruments\nThe following are the Group financial instruments as at the year-end held at amortised cost:\n31 March 2025\n31 March 2024\nUS$000\nUS$000\nFinancial assets\nCash and bank balances\n-\n439\nOther loans and receivables\n210\n956\n210\n1,395\nFinancial liabilities\nTrade and other payables\n210\n1,217\nBorrowings - current\n-\n130\nBorrowings - non-current\n-\n14,138\n210\n15,485\n-\n(14, 090)\n20.3.\nFinancial risk management objectives\nThe Group manages the risks arising from its operations, and financial instruments at Executive operating and Board level. The Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework and to ensure that the Group has adequate policies, procedures and controls to manage successfully the financial risks that the Group faces.\nFollowing the disposal of the Group's trading operations the Company's key financial market risks arise from changes in foreign exchange rates ('currency risk'). The Group is also exposed to credit risk and liquidity risk. The principal risks that the Group faces as at 31 March 2025 with an impact on financial instruments are summarised below.\n20.4.\nMarket Risk\nThe Group is exposed to currency risk. These are discussed further below on note 20.5 and note 20.6.\n20.5.\nCurrency risk\nPrior to the disposal of the Group's trading activities, certain of the Group companies have functional currencies other than US$ and the Group is therefore subject to fluctuations in exchange rates in translation of their results and financial position into US$ for the purposes of presenting consolidated accounts. The Company does not hedge against this translation risk. The Group's financial assets and liabilities by functional currency of the relevant company are as follows:\nAssets\nLiabilities\n31 March\n2025\n31 March\n2024\n31 March\n2025\n31 March\n2024\nUS$000\nUS$000\nUS$000\nUS$000\nGreat British Pound ('GBP')\n211\n11\n210\n143\nMozambique Metical ('MZN')\n-\n1,277\n-\n1,356\n211\n1,288\n210\n1,499\nFollowing the disposal of its trading operations, the Company transacts with suppliers and/or customers in currencies other than the functional currency. The Company does not hedge against this transactional risk. As at 31 March 2025 the Company's outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items were principally exposed to changes in the US$ / GBP.\n20.6.\nInterest rate risk\nFollowing the disposal of the Group's trading operations, there is no significant exposure to changes in interest rates at 31 March 2025.\n20.7.\nCredit risk\nFollowing the disposal of the Group's trading operations, there is no significant exposure to credit risk at 31 March 2025.\nThe maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying value of the Group financial assets disclosed in note 20.2. Details of provisions against financial assets are provided in note 17.\n20.8.\nLiquidity risk\nThe Company policy throughout the year has been to ensure that it has adequate liquidity by careful management of its working capital. The operating executives continually monitor the Group's actual and forecast cash flows and cash positions. They pay particular attention to ongoing expenditure, both for operating requirements and development activities, and matching of the maturity profile of the Group's overdrafts to the processing and sale of the Group's maize and beef products.\nFollowing the disposal of the Company's trading operations, Chepstow has agreed to provide the Company with access to an unsecured loan facility in the amount of up to \u00a3750,000. The purpose of the facility is to provide the Company with access to capital to ensure that the Company has sufficient working capital for a period of at least 18 (eighteen) months from completion of the disposal (\"Deadline Date\") or the date on which the Company completes an acquisition that would qualify as a reverse takeover under AIM Rule 14 or becoming an investing company in accordance with AIM Rule 8 (a \"Repayment Transaction\"). However, in the event that a Repayment Transaction has not taken place before the Deadline Date, Chepstow will irrevocably release the Company from its repayment obligations under the facility. Interest shall be charged at the rate of 4.5% per annum (or part thereof, if applicable), on a daily basis on amounts drawn down.\n21.

The balance due to Chepstow in respect of loans at 31 March 2025 was $nil (2024: $13,636,619). The Company charged Chepstow a fee of $210,000 for services in connection with the disposal. At\n31 March 2025, the Company has a receivable from Chepstow of $210,000 (2024: $nil)\nOn 31 March 2025, shareholders approved the disposal of the Company's Mozambique Agricultural Businesses to Chepstow.
