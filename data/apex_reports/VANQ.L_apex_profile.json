All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this document may be forward looking statements. Forward looking statements also often use words such as \"believe\", \"expect\", \"estimate\", \"intend\", \"anticipate\" and words of a similar meaning. By their nature, forward looking statements involve risk and uncertainty that could cause actual results to differ from those suggested by them. Much of the risk and uncertainty relates to factors that are beyond Vanquis Banking Group's ability to control or estimate precisely, such as future market conditions and the behaviours of other market participants, and therefore undue reliance should not be placed on such statements which speak only as at the date of this report. Vanquis Banking Group does not assume any obligation to, and does not intend to,\u00a0revise\u00a0or update these forward-looking statements, except as\u00a0required\u00a0pursuant to\u00a0applicable law or regulation. No statement in this announcement is intended as a profit forecast or estimate for any period. No statement in this announcement should be interpreted to\u00a0indicate\u00a0a particular level of profit and,\u00a0as a consequence, it should not be possible to derive a profit figure for any future period from this report.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
