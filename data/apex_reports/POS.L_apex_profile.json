This return to profitability is due to an exceptional licence deal and a large special project, in addition to progress made in the underlying revenue of the core business of Jack-up rental wellheads.\n\"The conclusion of the $5.2m licencing deal to SLB in December 2023 was a welcome cash boost, which also enabled us to begin consolidating Plexus' remaining products and licence rights into a new business direction. This strategy builds upon our long-standing success in the Jack-up wellhead market while adapting to the changing trends in the global offshore oil and gas drilling market. Notably, it addresses the North Sea's shift from traditional drilling to Carbon Capture Storage ('CCS') and Plug and Abandonment ('P&A') projects.\n\"The \u00a38m major rental contract has been a highlight as it has combined Plexus' POS-GRIP Technology and \"HG\" Seals deployed in a subsea application for P&A work, whilst also heavily supported by its specialised engineering capability. Once this project is completed, it will free up resources to pursue other similar work.\n\"The strategy now is to focus on short-term growth in Jack-up rental revenue, to maintain profitability, and to establish a diversified mix of income that can be more resilient to future cycles of the energy market and local government policies. This solid base will allow us to incubate and develop more of the underlying value in applications of POS-GRIP Technology that Plexus retains, including HG-R production wellhead remediation technology, HG Trees, the P&A market, and subsea infrastructure, such as the Python subsea wellhead system.\n\"Our recent achievements, including securing a major contract for subsea wellhead rental equipment and specialised P&A services for a North Sea operator, underscore Plexus' commitment to innovation and growth. By focusing on expanding our Exact\u2122 rental wellhead inventory and forging strong global partnerships, we are not only advancing our technology but also positioning ourselves to deliver exceptional value to our shareholders. The momentum we are building is the beginning of an exciting new chapter for Plexus.\n\"In closing, we recently announced changes in the Plexus Board, and as the new CEO, I would like to thank Ben van Bilderbeek and Graham Stevens for their contribution and leadership and look forward to working with Mike Park and Stas van Bilderbeek as we build the Company, our technology and products towards an exciting future.\"\nFor further information please visit\nwww.plexusplc.com\nor contact:\nPlexus Holdings PLC\nCraig Hendrie, CEO\nMike Park, CFO\nTel: 01224 774222\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\nDerrick Lee\nAdam Rae\nTel: 0131 220 6939\nSt Brides Partners Ltd\nIsabel de Salis\nPaul Dulieu\nWill Turner\nplexus@stbridespartners.co.uk\nCHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT\nBusiness progress\nThe Group's revenues increased in the 12 months to 30 June 2024 to \u00a312.7m (2023: \u00a31.5m), with a profit before tax of \u00a32.80m compared to loss of \u00a34.2m in the prior year.\nWith the SLB licence deal concluded and the new Executive team in place, we are well placed to add growth in the new energy marketplace, in particular supporting offshore activities in P&A work, gas and CCS storage, as well as continued oil and gas drilling and development.\nThe December 2023 IP Licence Agreement with SLB was a significant endorsement of Plexus' POS-GRIP Technology. We hope to see SLB flourish with this technology as it introduces derivative products into the market, leveraging the advantages of POS-GRIP-enabled wellheads, including reduced component complexity and the leak-proof seal integrity provided by POS-GRIP \"HG\" Technology. Following this exclusive licence for onshore and offshore surface production wellheads, we have had to readjust our expectations of the market still available to Plexus as we now only have the right to pursue smaller development projects and more technically challenging applications such as production wellheads requiring adjustability.\nThe August 2021 Exact Adjustable Wellhead licence agreement with SLB enabled Plexus to re-enter the Jack-up adjustable wellhead market with the proven Exact and Centric wellhead and mudline suspension products, which we originally invented and developed during the 1990's. This product range and market sector, which in the past was core to Plexus' product range is once again active and is now a key part of our short-term growth strategy. The market for rental wellheads for Jack-up rigs is somewhat different today to what we have seen in the last two decades, especially in the North Sea where the market has switched from Exploration Drilling and Development to P&A work with some gas and CCS storage work as well. The Exact wellhead range is perfectly suited to both P&A and drilling work (whether it be oil and gas exploration, or CCS) and so we have continued to expand our rental inventory of this equipment to meet strong growth expected in the Jack-up rental wellhead market at home and abroad.\nOur execution of the North Sea P&A campaign (see RNS dated 16.02.2024) using Exact rental wellhead equipment is progressing smoothly with both the equipment and Plexus' operational support teams performing well. In a recent development, the MR Connector, previously deployed on a floating-vessel-based P&A campaign with Oceaneering (see RNS dated 06.10.2023), has also been ordered for one well, which is additional work scope to the original contract. This addition to the contract for Jack-up rig operations shows the flexibility of the product as well as Plexus' capability to widen the scope of work and increase revenue with customers once work is underway.\nTo meet demand and further support growth in the Jack-up rental wellhead market, Plexus is manufacturing additional sets of Exact\u2122 wellhead equipment. The next four sets are scheduled for completion by the end of 2024, positioning them for deployment from the start of 2025. Plexus has also signed a new Master Services Agreement with a well management company. This agreement will facilitate orders for Exact\u2122 wellhead services for global projects, anticipated to generate a variety of work in the P&A sector, as well as in Jack-up exploration and appraisal drilling worldwide.\nThe \u00a38 million major rental contract announced last year is progressing on schedule and is expected to conclude within the next two months. This will free up internal resources for new ventures. Upon completion, Plexus plans to share its technical advancements with operators worldwide, which we anticipate will lead to similar opportunities.\nRecently, Plexus secured a new order for subsea wellhead rental equipment and services tailored for specialised P&A work for a North Sea operator. This project is projected to generate in excess of \u00a30.5 million in revenue within the current financial year.\nIntellectual Property\nPlexus' IP and decades-long track record of successful invention and innovation are the core of the Company, distinguishing it from many other wellhead and oilfield service companies.\nIn the Jack-up wellhead business, Plexus has a rich history of involvement in many of the wells which have been drilled around the world. Together with the Exact licence and collaboration with SLB we have a strong and unique position to be able to provide services for P&A work as it arises, in addition to new oil and gas or storage developments.\nPOS-GRIP Technology remains central to Plexus and has been endorsed by TFMC, which has the exclusive licence for POS-GRIP Jack-up Wellheads, and SLB, which is licenced for standard surface production wellheads. Plexus retains the rights to all subsea applications of the technology and other special applications; a longer-term strategy is to expand in these applications creating opportunities to broaden our product range or explore potential licensing to existing service companies.\nPOS-GRIP is heavily protected by patents, as well as proprietary information and know-how. This protection is in the process of further enhancement with two new method patents, which have now been published as applications, and are expected to be granted in the coming months. This will give all applications of POS-GRIP, including those already licenced to others, a renewed protection period of 20 years.\nStaff\nOn behalf of the Board, I would once again like to thank all our employees for their dedication and hard work during the year. I am confident that the anticipated increase in exploration and production drilling activity, are already beginning to show positive results this year, and will not only benefit our staff but also create future employment opportunities within Plexus.\nOutlook\nDespite the current climate of negativity towards offshore oil and gas, we are very optimistic about the growth of the business and the opportunities which are suited to our unique mix of proprietary products and engineering capability. The global demand for Jack-up rigs remains strong, and our product mix is well suited to many of the activities that these rigs are performing, such as P&A and CCS work in the North Sea, as well as exploration and production drilling in locations such as the Middle East and South-East Asia where demand remains strong.\nWith a strategy to focus on our products that provide a shorter lead time to profitability, collaboration with SLB, and robust IP for the medium and longer term, we have a solid foundation for growth, which will benefit our customers whilst enhancing shareholder returns. Additionally, by diversifying into P&A and emerging areas such as CCS and geothermal, we are reducing our reliance on oil and gas exploration and development.\nIn closing, I thank the Board and, in particular, the new Executive team, the Aberdeen management team and our staff for their continued hard work and support over the course of the year. I look forward to working with them all in the year ahead as we focus on delivering on our overriding objective, which remains to generate increasing value for all our shareholders.\nBen van Bilderbeek\nNon-Executive Chairman\n21 October 2024\nSTRATEGIC REPORT\nThe Directors present their strategic report for the year ended 30 June 2024.\nPrincipal Activity\nThe Group provides wellhead equipment and related equipment and services, for oil and gas drilling and production, CCS and gas storage, and well P&A activities. Plexus specialises in adjustable wellhead equipment which has particular benefits for work based on Jack-up rigs. Other specialised equipment based on Plexus POS-GRIP Technology are also offered.\nBusiness review\nA review of the development and performance of the business during the year consistent with its size and complexity, together with commentary on future developments including the main trends and factors likely to affect the business, is given in the Chairman's Statement. Where guidelines refer to the provision of key performance indicators, the directors are of the opinion certain financial and non-financial indicators included in the highlights and the Directors' Report meet this requirement.\nFinancial Results\nStatement of Comprehensive Income\nRevenue\nRevenue for the year was \u00a312,723k, a significant increase from \u00a31,487k in the previous year. This has been driven by the major contract noted in the operational review, which has generated \u00a37,644k in the current year and the SLB licensing agreement \u00a34,082k.\nMargin\nGross margin was broadly in line with last year at 72.2% (compared to 73.1% in the previous year). A year-to-year comparison on margin adds little value given the significant difference in the revenue mix in addition to the low revenue levels in the prior year. The licensing income has no associated cost of sales. Additionally, the specialised project has led to significant capex leading to increased rental asset depreciation which is included in cost of sales.\nOverhead expenses\nAdministrative expenses have increased compared to the prior year with expenditure of \u00a35,579k (2023: \u00a35,348k).\nContinuing salary and benefit costs remain the largest component of administrative expenses at \u00a33,267k compared to \u00a32,930k in the prior year.\nNon-recurring items\nThe statement of comprehensive income includes a gain of \u00a383k on the sale of an associate undertaking, which was recognised as an asset held for sale in the prior year.\nAdditionally, non-recurring items includes a payable of \u00a3693k relating to compensation for loss of office to two directors which was approved pre-year end and will become payable prior to or on 31 December 2024. Further details are included in the Remuneration Committee Report.\nProfit Before Tax\nProfit before tax of \u00a32,803k compared to a loss in the prior year of \u00a34,228k.\nAdjusted profit before tax of \u00a33,496k is stated prior to Non-recurring expense of \u00a3693k for compensation for loss of office for two directors, details of which are given in the Remuneration Committee Report.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nThe Directors use, amongst other things, Adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP measure to assess the Group's financial performance. The Directors consider Adjusted EBITDA to be the most appropriate measure of the underlying financial performance of the Group in the period.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year was a profit of \u00a35,446k, compared to a loss of \u00a32,451k in the previous year.\nAdjusted EBITDA on continuing operations is calculated as follows:\n2024\n\u00a3'000\n2023\n\u00a3'000\nOperating profit / (loss)\n2,910\n(4,261)\nAdd back:\n-Depreciation\n560\n307\n-Amortisation\n1,281\n1,253\nNon-recurring - Compensation for loss of office\n693\n-\nOther income\n2\n69\nShare in profit of associate\n-\n182\nFair value adjustment on financial assets\n-\n(1)\n-----\n-----\nAdjusted EBITDA on continuing operations\n5,446\n(2,451)\n-------\n-------\nTax\nThe Group shows a total income tax credit of \u00a3130k for the year compared to a tax credit of \u00a3213k for the prior year.\nEarning / (loss) per share\nThe Group reports basic earnings per share of 2.83p compared to a loss per share of 4.00p in the prior year.\nStatement of Financial Position\nIntangible Assets and Intellectual Property (\"IP\")\nThe net book value of intangible assets was \u00a38,312k, a decrease of 5% from \u00a38,731k last year. This movement represents total investment of \u00a3558k less the annual amortisation charge of \u00a3977k.\nPlexus owns an extensive range of IP which includes many registered patents and trademarks across a number of jurisdictions, and actively works to develop and protect new methods and applications. In addition to registered IP, Plexus has developed over many years a vast body of specialist know-how. Plexus is also currently pursuing the registration of Method Patents, which would further extend the scope of current patent protections.\nThe market capitalisation of the Company at the reporting date is \u00a313.72m, which is less than the carrying value of the assets (\u00a319.91m); this is an indicator of impairment. Following a thorough review, including a discounted cashflow model which has included cashflows for 20 years, the Directors have concluded no impairment of IP is required. Therefore, the Directors consider the current carrying values to be appropriate.\nResearch and Development (\"R&D\")\nR&D expenditure including patents increased from \u00a3516k in 2023 to \u00a3558k in 2024. Continued investment in R&D demonstrates the Group is protecting, developing, and broadening the range of its product offering.\nTangible Assets\nThe net book value of property, plant and equipment and items under construction at the year-end was \u00a33,908k compared to \u00a31,404k last year. Capital expenditure on tangible assets increased to \u00a33,064k compared to \u00a3890k in the prior year. The capex in the year was largely to service the major contract, and the equipment used can be deployed again in the future.\nInvestments / Asset held for sale\nThe asset held for sale in the prior year relates to Plexus' 49% investment in Kincardine Manufacturing Services Limited (\"KMS\"). The investment was subsequently sold for a total consideration of \u00a31m in the year. The sale gave rise to a gain on sale of \u00a383k which is included in the statement of comprehensive income.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash at the year-end was \u00a32,486k compared to \u00a31,149k in the prior year, reflecting a net cash inflow for the year of \u00a31,037k.\nThe expected future cash inflows and the cash balances held are anticipated to be adequate to meet current on-going working capital, capital expenditure, R&D, and project related commitments.\nConvertible loans\nOn 31 January 2024, the Company made a cash payment to redeem \u00a3850k of loan notes. Including a redemption premium of \u00a3170k, a total payment of \u00a31,020k was made. At the reporting date the outstanding loan notes have a fair value of \u00a3856k (2023: \u00a31,702).\nDividends\nThe Company has not paid any dividends in the year and does not propose to pay a final dividend. Whilst the Company remains committed to distributing dividends to its shareholders when appropriate, the Directors believe that it is prudent to suspend the payment of dividends considering the ongoing capital and operational requirements of the business.\nOperations\nThe Group's primary focus during the year has been the successful delivery of the major contract noted in the operational overview. This has generated revenue of \u00a37,644k in the current year.\nPlexus continued to invest in R&D during the year, with significant focus on optimising the Exact rental exploration wellhead product range for the current market and completing product development and testing required for the specialised project. R&D remains an important operational activity and further develops the value of our IP and ability to extend the range of applications of our technology.\nStaff at the end of June 2024 (excluding non-executive directors) comprised 37 employees, including one international employee, with a weighted average total of 36 which remains unchanged from the prior year.\nStaff development remains a significant focus with the completion of a comprehensive evaluation and revision of the in-house training modules to ensure they continue to provide the necessary underpinning knowledge and skills which is required of those fulfilling technical roles.\nThe Company continues to maintain the OPITO accreditation for its competency management system, with continual developments and improvements to the process, ensuring a robust assessment of employees in safety--critical roles.\nHealth and Safety continues to be a pivotal part of the business and remains a key focus. Plexus remains fully committed to continually improving safety standards and the safety culture across the business. This is reflected in the business being once again lost time injury (\"LTI\") free this year. Plexus has now passed its ninth anniversary of this milestone in September 2024.\nPlexus continues to comply with the requirements of the API Q1/ISO 9001 and ISO 45001 standard leading to the retention of both API 6A and 17D Licences. These accreditations demonstrate Plexus' capability and determination to operate under the highest standards. Post period end API conducted an audit, with Plexus retaining its API Q1 accreditation.\nStrategy and Future Developments\nPlexus has been involved in the design of specialised wellhead equipment for the offshore market for over 40 years, and this history and knowledge continues to drive the products and services that are offered.\nIn 2021, Plexus licenced the Exact wellhead and Centric mudline systems back from SLB and set about updating and improving this product range to compete in the current market. This has resulted in the Exact EX adjustable wellhead system, which is optimised for use on modern Jack-up rigs when they are used for exploration drilling, development, or CCS pre-drilling or P&A activities. This optimised system is significantly more cost effective than competing through-BOP adjustable wellheads, and Plexus is developing a fleet of rental wellhead systems to be deployed in this market, which forms the core of the short-term business growth.\nPlexus retains the right to offer POS-GRIP surface production for small projects of less than four systems and in specialised applications such as adjustable wellheads. These types of opportunities are usually 12 months or more in the planning and manufacturing stages, and so this market sector will continue to be developed as a medium-term growth objective.\nIn the longer term, Plexus is working on leveraging the remaining applications of POS-GRIP, which are for subsea and other specialised applications. POS-GRIP has been successfully deployed in subsea applications recently, such as the Oceaneering P&A campaign and the current special application. These projects have used technology from the Python subsea wellhead system, and such successful deployments are significant steps along the way of field-testing elements of the system, making a full deployment of the Python system more viable.\nKey Performance Indicators\nThe Directors monitor the performance of the Group by reference to certain financial and non-financial key performance indicators. The financial indicators include revenue, adjusted EBITDA, profit/loss, earnings per share, cash balances, and working capital resources and requirements. The analysis of these is included in the financial results section of this report. Non-financial indicators include Health and Safety statistics, R&D activity, equipment utilisation rates, the level of ongoing customer interest and support. The non-financial key performance indicators are included within the strategic report.\nPr\nincipal Risks and Risk Management\nThere are a number of potential risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the Group's performance, which include the following.\n(a)\nPolitical, legal, and environmental risks\nPlexus aims to participate in a global market where the exploration and production of oil and gas reserves, and the access to those reserves can be adversely impacted by changes in political, operational, and environmental circumstances. The current global political and environmental landscape, particularly in relation to climate change and net zero goals, continues to demonstrate how such factors can generate risks and uncertainties that can present a risk to trading. Such risks also extend to legal and regulatory issues, and it is important to understand that these can change at short notice. Regulatory changes can have an adverse impact on investment levels, as of course does a country's decision-making process in relation to granting new exploration and production drilling opportunities. To help address and balance such risks, the Group where possible seeks to broaden its geographic footprint and customer base, as well as actively looking to forge commercial relationships with large industry players, and potential licencees.\n(b)\nOil and Gas Sector Trends\nNew technologies, particularly in relation to renewables such as wind and solar, alternative energies and current developments such as the increasing use of electric vehicles could all in the future prove very disruptive to the traditional oil and gas industry and the corresponding demand for exploration and production equipment and services. To help mitigate this risk Plexus is committed to work in areas such as renewables, carbon capture and decommissioning, ensuring diversification from exploration and production.\n(c)\nTechnology\nIt is critical to the success of the Group to be able to anticipate changes in technology or in industry standards and to successfully develop and introduce new, enhanced and competitive products on a timely basis and keep pace with technological change.\nAs noted above, the Company is committed to widening the application of its technology. In order to ensure that the Group's technology and IP develop, the Group commits resources annually to research and development and is open to completing sponsored R&D projects on behalf of customers. Additionally, senior management have regular meetings with key end-customers to maintain visibility over their technological requirements.\n(d)\nCompetitive risk\nThe Group operates in highly competitive markets and often competes directly with large multi-national corporations who have greater resources and are more established. This risk has become more concentrated over recent years following a series of mergers and acquisitions by competitors creating larger entities. The major oil service and equipment company consolidations have magnified such issues as competitors reduce in number but increase in size, influence, and reach. Unforeseen product innovation or technical advances by competitors could adversely affect the Group, and lead to a slower take up of the Group's proprietary technology. To mitigate this risk, Plexus has an active R&D programme, and maintains an extensive suite of patents and trademarks, and actively continues to develop and improve its IP, including adding to its existing extensive 'know-how' to ensure that it continues to be able to offer unique superior wellhead design solutions.\n(e)\nOperational\nThe Group operates in highly competitive markets, often directly against large multi-national corporations who have greater resources, are more established and have a larger geographical footprint. As a smaller group, the main operational risk is not obtaining work due to availability of equipment and resources. Plexus is mitigating this risk by focussing on increasing its rental fleet, and attempting to increase its geographical reach, by targeting work in new regions.\n(f)\nGoing Concern, liquidity, and finance requirements\nAs a relatively small business with adequate, but not excess cash resources, and following a number of loss-making years, Plexus has to closely monitor and manage cash flow. Additionally, Plexus' smaller market cap can be a negative factor if consideration is given to raising additional funds in the public markets.\nThe Group undertakes cashflow forecasting throughout the year to ensure the going-concern assumption is still appropriate. As disclosed, the Group is reliant on raising additional funding,\nan event that was indicated at the time the convertible loan arrangements were entered into in October 2022, and there can be no certainty regarding the timing and quantum of future funding and therefore this indicates a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt regarding the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.\n(g)\nCredit\nThe main credit risk is attributable to trade receivables. Where the Group's customers are large international oil and gas companies the risk of non-payment is significantly reduced, and therefore is more likely to be related to client satisfaction. Where smaller independent oil and gas companies are concerned, credit risk can be a factor. Customer payments can potentially involve extended payment terms. This risk can be mitigated by agreeing structured payment terms on larger value contracts with milestone stage payments. The Group's exposure to credit risk is monitored continuously, and to date its collections record has been extremely reliable.\n(h)\nRisk assessment\nThe Board has established an on-going process for identifying, evaluating, and managing significant risk areas faced by the Group. One of the Board's control documents is a detailed \"Risks assessment & management document,\" which categorises risks in terms of: business area (which includes IT), compliance, finance, cash, receivables, fixed assets, other debtors/prepayments, creditors, legal, and personnel. These risks are assessed and updated as and when appropriate and can be associated with a variety of internal and external sources including regulatory requirements, disruption to information systems including cyber-crime, control breakdowns and social, ethical, environmental and health and safety issues.\nSection 172 Statement\nThis section serves as the section 172 statement and should be read in conjunction with the full Strategic Report and the Corporate Governance Report. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 requires directors to take into consideration the interests of stakeholders in their decision making. The Directors continue to have regard to the interests of the Company's employees and other stakeholders, including shareholders, customers and suppliers, Licence Partners and the community and environment, through positive engagement and when making decisions. Acting in good faith and fairly between members, the Directors consider what is most likely to promote the success of the Company for its members in the long term and to protect the reputation of the Company.\nShareholders\nPlexus seeks to develop an investor base of long-term shareholders that are aligned to our strategy, whether institutional or private retail investors. By communicating our strategy and objectives, we seek to maintain continued support from our investor base. Important issues include financial stability and the strength of the statement of financial position and protecting and strengthening the value of our intellectual property. Engagement with shareholders is a key element to this objective and methods of engagement are detailed in the Corporate Governance Report. During the year, the Finance Director supported by other members of the executive team, the Company's broker, and the Investor Relations advisor, engaged where possible with investors by email, presentations, direct conversations, and ad-hoc meetings. The Company also continues to update its website to provide investors and other stakeholders with access to information about the Company. During the year, several key decisions were made by the Board, including extending the licensing agreement with SLB which raised funds of $5.2m. This fund-raising related decision was aimed at increasing shareholder value.\nEmployees\nThe Group's UK staff are engaged by the Company's subsidiary Plexus Ocean Systems Limited based in Aberdeen, Scotland. As a relatively small company with fewer than 40 employees largely operating in one location, there is a high level of visibility regarding employee engagement and satisfaction. The Company is engaged with a specialist firm of benefits advisers who can offer a comprehensive service to employees as well as to the Company. The Company consults with employees on matters of competency, training, and health and safety as detailed in the Corporate Governance Report. Since the last report, the Company successfully achieved nine continuous years with no Lost Time Injuries (\"LTI\") and this successful safety culture has continued beyond that anniversary to the date of writing.\nCustomers and Suppliers\nThe Company is committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all business dealings and relationships. Fostering good business relationships with key stakeholders including customers and suppliers is important to the Company's success. The Board seeks to implement and enforce effective systems and controls to ensure its supply chain is maintaining the highest standard of business conduct in line with best practice including in relation to anti-bribery and modern slavery.\nLicence Partners\nThe Company engages with Licence Partners in a way that follows the same principles as those applied to relationships with other customers and suppliers. Additionally, the Company engages with its Licence Partners to support their efforts to achieve commercial success by holding, as and when required, technical workshops, technical training, and data transfer. Following the announcement in November 2020 of entering into a non-exclusive surface wellhead licencing agreement with Cameron (SLB) and the extension of this agreement in December 2021, and the further agreement signed in December 2023, regular Teams meetings and occasional face to face meetings have been held as part of the process of transferring Plexus' relevant IP so that Cameron can design and develop its own low-cost wellhead with POS-GRIP technology inside. In May 2023 SLB exercised its option to extend its non-exclusive licence agreement with Plexus for an additional six years effective from November 2023. This was then the followed with the additional licensing agreement in December 2023.\nCommunity and Environment\nThe Company has minimal environmental impact in the localities in which it operates. This clearly helps the Company meet its corporate objectives in this regard but is never taken for granted. In the year under review, the Company met its target for waste management and in general continues to operate in a manner that is open, honest, and socially responsible.\nM Park\nChief Financial

On the basis losses have not been fully utilised in the current financial year management consider that the probable threshold is not met and have released the asset to the extent there are not sufficient taxable temporary differences.

Management considers this to be appropriate for a new technology gaining industry acceptance;\n\u00b7\nPrices will rise with inflation;\n\u00b7\nCosts, in particular direct costs and staff costs, are based on past experiences and management's knowledge of the industry.\nThese assumptions were determined from the directors' knowledge and experience.\nThe value in use calculation is based on cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial model information available. Although the Group's technology is proven and has proven commercial value the exploitation of opportunities beyond the rental wellhead exploration equipment services market are at a relatively early stage and the commercialisation process is expected to be a long term one. The cash flow forecasts therefore extend to 2044 to ensure the full benefit of all current projects is realised. The rationale for using a timescale up to 2044 with growth projections which increase in the first five years and decline thereafter, is that as time progresses, Plexus expects to gain an increasing foothold in the surface, subsea and other equipment markets, including the recent re-entry into the Jack-up exploration rental wellhead sector. This has been evidenced with an increase in enquiries following the work undertaken in the year on the major rental contract. As the Group is starting from a base point of trading, the growth rates are expected to be high in the initial years then in later years, where the technology becomes established, the expected rate of growth declines.\nThe key assumptions used in these calculations include the discount rate (10.87%), revenue projections, growth rates, expected gross margins and the lifespan of the Group's technology.\nManagement estimates the discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the Group and the markets in which it operates. Revenue projections, growth rates, margins and technology lifespans are all estimated based on the latest business models and the most recent discussions with customers, suppliers and other business partners.\nManagement regularly assesses the sensitivity of the key assumptions, including a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate flexing it by 5% both positively and negatively. It would require significant adjustments to key assumptions before the goodwill and other intangibles would be impaired.\nPatent and other development costs are internally generated.\nThe impairment review has been conducted on two CGUs, split by the category of IP: Deepwater and Conventional.\n6.\nProperty plant and equipment\nBuildings\n\u00a3000\nTenant\nImprovements\n\u00a3000\nEquipment\n\u00a3000\nAssets under construction\n\u00a3000\nMotor vehicles\n\u00a3000\nTotal\n\u00a3000\nCost\nAs at 30 June 2022\n685\n844\n5,360\n-\n17\n6,906\nAdditions\n-\n15\n123\n752\n-\n890\nTransfers\n-\n-\n367\n(367)\n-\n-\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\nAs at 30 June 2023\n685\n859\n5,850\n385\n17\n7,796\nAdditions\n-\n-\n183\n2,881\n-\n3,064\nTransfers\n-\n-\n2,862\n(2,862)\n-\n-\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\nAs at 30 June 2024\n685\n859\n8,895\n404\n17\n10,860\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\nDepreciation\nAs at 30 June 2022\n685\n606\n4,779\n-\n15\n6,085\nCharge for the year\n-\n74\n231\n-\n2\n307\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\nAs at 30 June 2023\n685\n680\n5,010\n-\n17\n6,392\nCharge for the year\n-\n76\n484\n-\n-\n560\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\nAs at 30 June 2024\n685\n756\n5,494\n-\n17\n6,952\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\nNet book value\nAs at 30 June 2024\n-\n103\n3,401\n404\n-\n3,908\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\nAs at 30 June 2023\n-\n179\n840\n385\n-\n1,404\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\nDuring the year additions to Assets under construction included \u00a31,160k previously recognised in inventory.\nThe value in use of property, plant and equipment is not materially different from the carrying value.\n7.

This return to profitability is due to an exceptional licence deal and a large special project, in addition to progress made in the underlying revenue of the core business of Jack-up rental wellheads.\n\"The conclusion of the $5.2m licencing deal to SLB in December 2023 was a welcome cash boost, which also enabled us to begin consolidating Plexus' remaining products and licence rights into a new business direction. This strategy builds upon our long-standing success in the Jack-up wellhead market while adapting to the changing trends in the global offshore oil and gas drilling market. Notably, it addresses the North Sea's shift from traditional drilling to Carbon Capture Storage ('CCS') and Plug and Abandonment ('P&A') projects.\n\"The \u00a38m major rental contract has been a highlight as it has combined Plexus' POS-GRIP Technology and \"HG\" Seals deployed in a subsea application for P&A work, whilst also heavily supported by its specialised engineering capability. Once this project is completed, it will free up resources to pursue other similar work.\n\"The strategy now is to focus on short-term growth in Jack-up rental revenue, to maintain profitability, and to establish a diversified mix of income that can be more resilient to future cycles of the energy market and local government policies. This solid base will allow us to incubate and develop more of the underlying value in applications of POS-GRIP Technology that Plexus retains, including HG-R production wellhead remediation technology, HG Trees, the P&A market, and subsea infrastructure, such as the Python subsea wellhead system.\n\"Our recent achievements, including securing a major contract for subsea wellhead rental equipment and specialised P&A services for a North Sea operator, underscore Plexus' commitment to innovation and growth. By focusing on expanding our Exact\u2122 rental wellhead inventory and forging strong global partnerships, we are not only advancing our technology but also positioning ourselves to deliver exceptional value to our shareholders. The momentum we are building is the beginning of an exciting new chapter for Plexus.\n\"In closing, we recently announced changes in the Plexus Board, and as the new CEO, I would like to thank Ben van Bilderbeek and Graham Stevens for their contribution and leadership and look forward to working with Mike Park and Stas van Bilderbeek as we build the Company, our technology and products towards an exciting future.\"\nFor further information please visit\nwww.plexusplc.com\nor contact:\nPlexus Holdings PLC\nCraig Hendrie, CEO\nMike Park, CFO\nTel: 01224 774222\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\nDerrick Lee\nAdam Rae\nTel: 0131 220 6939\nSt Brides Partners Ltd\nIsabel de Salis\nPaul Dulieu\nWill Turner\nplexus@stbridespartners.co.uk\nCHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT\nBusiness progress\nThe Group's revenues increased in the 12 months to 30 June 2024 to \u00a312.7m (2023: \u00a31.5m), with a profit before tax of \u00a32.80m compared to loss of \u00a34.2m in the prior year.\nWith the SLB licence deal concluded and the new Executive team in place, we are well placed to add growth in the new energy marketplace, in particular supporting offshore activities in P&A work, gas and CCS storage, as well as continued oil and gas drilling and development.\nThe December 2023 IP Licence Agreement with SLB was a significant endorsement of Plexus' POS-GRIP Technology. We hope to see SLB flourish with this technology as it introduces derivative products into the market, leveraging the advantages of POS-GRIP-enabled wellheads, including reduced component complexity and the leak-proof seal integrity provided by POS-GRIP \"HG\" Technology. Following this exclusive licence for onshore and offshore surface production wellheads, we have had to readjust our expectations of the market still available to Plexus as we now only have the right to pursue smaller development projects and more technically challenging applications such as production wellheads requiring adjustability.\nThe August 2021 Exact Adjustable Wellhead licence agreement with SLB enabled Plexus to re-enter the Jack-up adjustable wellhead market with the proven Exact and Centric wellhead and mudline suspension products, which we originally invented and developed during the 1990's. This product range and market sector, which in the past was core to Plexus' product range is once again active and is now a key part of our short-term growth strategy. The market for rental wellheads for Jack-up rigs is somewhat different today to what we have seen in the last two decades, especially in the North Sea where the market has switched from Exploration Drilling and Development to P&A work with some gas and CCS storage work as well. The Exact wellhead range is perfectly suited to both P&A and drilling work (whether it be oil and gas exploration, or CCS) and so we have continued to expand our rental inventory of this equipment to meet strong growth expected in the Jack-up rental wellhead market at home and abroad.\nOur execution of the North Sea P&A campaign (see RNS dated 16.02.2024) using Exact rental wellhead equipment is progressing smoothly with both the equipment and Plexus' operational support teams performing well. In a recent development, the MR Connector, previously deployed on a floating-vessel-based P&A campaign with Oceaneering (see RNS dated 06.10.2023), has also been ordered for one well, which is additional work scope to the original contract. This addition to the contract for Jack-up rig operations shows the flexibility of the product as well as Plexus' capability to widen the scope of work and increase revenue with customers once work is underway.\nTo meet demand and further support growth in the Jack-up rental wellhead market, Plexus is manufacturing additional sets of Exact\u2122 wellhead equipment. The next four sets are scheduled for completion by the end of 2024, positioning them for deployment from the start of 2025. Plexus has also signed a new Master Services Agreement with a well management company. This agreement will facilitate orders for Exact\u2122 wellhead services for global projects, anticipated to generate a variety of work in the P&A sector, as well as in Jack-up exploration and appraisal drilling worldwide.\nThe \u00a38 million major rental contract announced last year is progressing on schedule and is expected to conclude within the next two months. This will free up internal resources for new ventures. Upon completion, Plexus plans to share its technical advancements with operators worldwide, which we anticipate will lead to similar opportunities.\nRecently, Plexus secured a new order for subsea wellhead rental equipment and services tailored for specialised P&A work for a North Sea operator. This project is projected to generate in excess of \u00a30.5 million in revenue within the current financial year.\nIntellectual Property\nPlexus' IP and decades-long track record of successful invention and innovation are the core of the Company, distinguishing it from many other wellhead and oilfield service companies.\nIn the Jack-up wellhead business, Plexus has a rich history of involvement in many of the wells which have been drilled around the world. Together with the Exact licence and collaboration with SLB we have a strong and unique position to be able to provide services for P&A work as it arises, in addition to new oil and gas or storage developments.\nPOS-GRIP Technology remains central to Plexus and has been endorsed by TFMC, which has the exclusive licence for POS-GRIP Jack-up Wellheads, and SLB, which is licenced for standard surface production wellheads. Plexus retains the rights to all subsea applications of the technology and other special applications; a longer-term strategy is to expand in these applications creating opportunities to broaden our product range or explore potential licensing to existing service companies.\nPOS-GRIP is heavily protected by patents, as well as proprietary information and know-how. This protection is in the process of further enhancement with two new method patents, which have now been published as applications, and are expected to be granted in the coming months. This will give all applications of POS-GRIP, including those already licenced to others, a renewed protection period of 20 years.\nStaff\nOn behalf of the Board, I would once again like to thank all our employees for their dedication and hard work during the year. I am confident that the anticipated increase in exploration and production drilling activity, are already beginning to show positive results this year, and will not only benefit our staff but also create future employment opportunities within Plexus.\nOutlook\nDespite the current climate of negativity towards offshore oil and gas, we are very optimistic about the growth of the business and the opportunities which are suited to our unique mix of proprietary products and engineering capability. The global demand for Jack-up rigs remains strong, and our product mix is well suited to many of the activities that these rigs are performing, such as P&A and CCS work in the North Sea, as well as exploration and production drilling in locations such as the Middle East and South-East Asia where demand remains strong.\nWith a strategy to focus on our products that provide a shorter lead time to profitability, collaboration with SLB, and robust IP for the medium and longer term, we have a solid foundation for growth, which will benefit our customers whilst enhancing shareholder returns. Additionally, by diversifying into P&A and emerging areas such as CCS and geothermal, we are reducing our reliance on oil and gas exploration and development.\nIn closing, I thank the Board and, in particular, the new Executive team, the Aberdeen management team and our staff for their continued hard work and support over the course of the year. I look forward to working with them all in the year ahead as we focus on delivering on our overriding objective, which remains to generate increasing value for all our shareholders.\nBen van Bilderbeek\nNon-Executive Chairman\n21 October 2024\nSTRATEGIC REPORT\nThe Directors present their strategic report for the year ended 30 June 2024.\nPrincipal Activity\nThe Group provides wellhead equipment and related equipment and services, for oil and gas drilling and production, CCS and gas storage, and well P&A activities. Plexus specialises in adjustable wellhead equipment which has particular benefits for work based on Jack-up rigs. Other specialised equipment based on Plexus POS-GRIP Technology are also offered.\nBusiness review\nA review of the development and performance of the business during the year consistent with its size and complexity, together with commentary on future developments including the main trends and factors likely to affect the business, is given in the Chairman's Statement. Where guidelines refer to the provision of key performance indicators, the directors are of the opinion certain financial and non-financial indicators included in the highlights and the Directors' Report meet this requirement.\nFinancial Results\nStatement of Comprehensive Income\nRevenue\nRevenue for the year was \u00a312,723k, a significant increase from \u00a31,487k in the previous year. This has been driven by the major contract noted in the operational review, which has generated \u00a37,644k in the current year and the SLB licensing agreement \u00a34,082k.\nMargin\nGross margin was broadly in line with last year at 72.2% (compared to 73.1% in the previous year). A year-to-year comparison on margin adds little value given the significant difference in the revenue mix in addition to the low revenue levels in the prior year. The licensing income has no associated cost of sales. Additionally, the specialised project has led to significant capex leading to increased rental asset depreciation which is included in cost of sales.\nOverhead expenses\nAdministrative expenses have increased compared to the prior year with expenditure of \u00a35,579k (2023: \u00a35,348k).\nContinuing salary and benefit costs remain the largest component of administrative expenses at \u00a33,267k compared to \u00a32,930k in the prior year.\nNon-recurring items\nThe statement of comprehensive income includes a gain of \u00a383k on the sale of an associate undertaking, which was recognised as an asset held for sale in the prior year.\nAdditionally, non-recurring items includes a payable of \u00a3693k relating to compensation for loss of office to two directors which was approved pre-year end and will become payable prior to or on 31 December 2024. Further details are included in the Remuneration Committee Report.\nProfit Before Tax\nProfit before tax of \u00a32,803k compared to a loss in the prior year of \u00a34,228k.\nAdjusted profit before tax of \u00a33,496k is stated prior to Non-recurring expense of \u00a3693k for compensation for loss of office for two directors, details of which are given in the Remuneration Committee Report.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nThe Directors use, amongst other things, Adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP measure to assess the Group's financial performance. The Directors consider Adjusted EBITDA to be the most appropriate measure of the underlying financial performance of the Group in the period.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year was a profit of \u00a35,446k, compared to a loss of \u00a32,451k in the previous year.\nAdjusted EBITDA on continuing operations is calculated as follows:\n2024\n\u00a3'000\n2023\n\u00a3'000\nOperating profit / (loss)\n2,910\n(4,261)\nAdd back:\n-Depreciation\n560\n307\n-Amortisation\n1,281\n1,253\nNon-recurring - Compensation for loss of office\n693\n-\nOther income\n2\n69\nShare in profit of associate\n-\n182\nFair value adjustment on financial assets\n-\n(1)\n-----\n-----\nAdjusted EBITDA on continuing operations\n5,446\n(2,451)\n-------\n-------\nTax\nThe Group shows a total income tax credit of \u00a3130k for the year compared to a tax credit of \u00a3213k for the prior year.\nEarning / (loss) per share\nThe Group reports basic earnings per share of 2.83p compared to a loss per share of 4.00p in the prior year.\nStatement of Financial Position\nIntangible Assets and Intellectual Property (\"IP\")\nThe net book value of intangible assets was \u00a38,312k, a decrease of 5% from \u00a38,731k last year. This movement represents total investment of \u00a3558k less the annual amortisation charge of \u00a3977k.\nPlexus owns an extensive range of IP which includes many registered patents and trademarks across a number of jurisdictions, and actively works to develop and protect new methods and applications. In addition to registered IP, Plexus has developed over many years a vast body of specialist know-how. Plexus is also currently pursuing the registration of Method Patents, which would further extend the scope of current patent protections.\nThe market capitalisation of the Company at the reporting date is \u00a313.72m, which is less than the carrying value of the assets (\u00a319.91m); this is an indicator of impairment. Following a thorough review, including a discounted cashflow model which has included cashflows for 20 years, the Directors have concluded no impairment of IP is required. Therefore, the Directors consider the current carrying values to be appropriate.\nResearch and Development (\"R&D\")\nR&D expenditure including patents increased from \u00a3516k in 2023 to \u00a3558k in 2024. Continued investment in R&D demonstrates the Group is protecting, developing, and broadening the range of its product offering.\nTangible Assets\nThe net book value of property, plant and equipment and items under construction at the year-end was \u00a33,908k compared to \u00a31,404k last year. Capital expenditure on tangible assets increased to \u00a33,064k compared to \u00a3890k in the prior year. The capex in the year was largely to service the major contract, and the equipment used can be deployed again in the future.\nInvestments / Asset held for sale\nThe asset held for sale in the prior year relates to Plexus' 49% investment in Kincardine Manufacturing Services Limited (\"KMS\"). The investment was subsequently sold for a total consideration of \u00a31m in the year. The sale gave rise to a gain on sale of \u00a383k which is included in the statement of comprehensive income.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash at the year-end was \u00a32,486k compared to \u00a31,149k in the prior year, reflecting a net cash inflow for the year of \u00a31,037k.\nThe expected future cash inflows and the cash balances held are anticipated to be adequate to meet current on-going working capital, capital expenditure, R&D, and project related commitments.\nConvertible loans\nOn 31 January 2024, the Company made a cash payment to redeem \u00a3850k of loan notes. Including a redemption premium of \u00a3170k, a total payment of \u00a31,020k was made. At the reporting date the outstanding loan notes have a fair value of \u00a3856k (2023: \u00a31,702).\nDividends\nThe Company has not paid any dividends in the year and does not propose to pay a final dividend. Whilst the Company remains committed to distributing dividends to its shareholders when appropriate, the Directors believe that it is prudent to suspend the payment of dividends considering the ongoing capital and operational requirements of the business.\nOperations\nThe Group's primary focus during the year has been the successful delivery of the major contract noted in the operational overview. This has generated revenue of \u00a37,644k in the current year.\nPlexus continued to invest in R&D during the year, with significant focus on optimising the Exact rental exploration wellhead product range for the current market and completing product development and testing required for the specialised project. R&D remains an important operational activity and further develops the value of our IP and ability to extend the range of applications of our technology.\nStaff at the end of June 2024 (excluding non-executive directors) comprised 37 employees, including one international employee, with a weighted average total of 36 which remains unchanged from the prior year.\nStaff development remains a significant focus with the completion of a comprehensive evaluation and revision of the in-house training modules to ensure they continue to provide the necessary underpinning knowledge and skills which is required of those fulfilling technical roles.\nThe Company continues to maintain the OPITO accreditation for its competency management system, with continual developments and improvements to the process, ensuring a robust assessment of employees in safety--critical roles.\nHealth and Safety continues to be a pivotal part of the business and remains a key focus. Plexus remains fully committed to continually improving safety standards and the safety culture across the business. This is reflected in the business being once again lost time injury (\"LTI\") free this year. Plexus has now passed its ninth anniversary of this milestone in September 2024.\nPlexus continues to comply with the requirements of the API Q1/ISO 9001 and ISO 45001 standard leading to the retention of both API 6A and 17D Licences. These accreditations demonstrate Plexus' capability and determination to operate under the highest standards. Post period end API conducted an audit, with Plexus retaining its API Q1 accreditation.\nStrategy and Future Developments\nPlexus has been involved in the design of specialised wellhead equipment for the offshore market for over 40 years, and this history and knowledge continues to drive the products and services that are offered.\nIn 2021, Plexus licenced the Exact wellhead and Centric mudline systems back from SLB and set about updating and improving this product range to compete in the current market. This has resulted in the Exact EX adjustable wellhead system, which is optimised for use on modern Jack-up rigs when they are used for exploration drilling, development, or CCS pre-drilling or P&A activities. This optimised system is significantly more cost effective than competing through-BOP adjustable wellheads, and Plexus is developing a fleet of rental wellhead systems to be deployed in this market, which forms the core of the short-term business growth.\nPlexus retains the right to offer POS-GRIP surface production for small projects of less than four systems and in specialised applications such as adjustable wellheads. These types of opportunities are usually 12 months or more in the planning and manufacturing stages, and so this market sector will continue to be developed as a medium-term growth objective.\nIn the longer term, Plexus is working on leveraging the remaining applications of POS-GRIP, which are for subsea and other specialised applications. POS-GRIP has been successfully deployed in subsea applications recently, such as the Oceaneering P&A campaign and the current special application. These projects have used technology from the Python subsea wellhead system, and such successful deployments are significant steps along the way of field-testing elements of the system, making a full deployment of the Python system more viable.\nKey Performance Indicators\nThe Directors monitor the performance of the Group by reference to certain financial and non-financial key performance indicators. The financial indicators include revenue, adjusted EBITDA, profit/loss, earnings per share, cash balances, and working capital resources and requirements. The analysis of these is included in the financial results section of this report. Non-financial indicators include Health and Safety statistics, R&D activity, equipment utilisation rates, the level of ongoing customer interest and support. The non-financial key performance indicators are included within the strategic report.\nPr\nincipal Risks and Risk Management\nThere are a number of potential risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the Group's performance, which include the following.\n(a)\nPolitical, legal, and environmental risks\nPlexus aims to participate in a global market where the exploration and production of oil and gas reserves, and the access to those reserves can be adversely impacted by changes in political, operational, and environmental circumstances. The current global political and environmental landscape, particularly in relation to climate change and net zero goals, continues to demonstrate how such factors can generate risks and uncertainties that can present a risk to trading. Such risks also extend to legal and regulatory issues, and it is important to understand that these can change at short notice. Regulatory changes can have an adverse impact on investment levels, as of course does a country's decision-making process in relation to granting new exploration and production drilling opportunities. To help address and balance such risks, the Group where possible seeks to broaden its geographic footprint and customer base, as well as actively looking to forge commercial relationships with large industry players, and potential licencees.\n(b)\nOil and Gas Sector Trends\nNew technologies, particularly in relation to renewables such as wind and solar, alternative energies and current developments such as the increasing use of electric vehicles could all in the future prove very disruptive to the traditional oil and gas industry and the corresponding demand for exploration and production equipment and services. To help mitigate this risk Plexus is committed to work in areas such as renewables, carbon capture and decommissioning, ensuring diversification from exploration and production.\n(c)\nTechnology\nIt is critical to the success of the Group to be able to anticipate changes in technology or in industry standards and to successfully develop and introduce new, enhanced and competitive products on a timely basis and keep pace with technological change.\nAs noted above, the Company is committed to widening the application of its technology. In order to ensure that the Group's technology and IP develop, the Group commits resources annually to research and development and is open to completing sponsored R&D projects on behalf of customers. Additionally, senior management have regular meetings with key end-customers to maintain visibility over their technological requirements.\n(d)\nCompetitive risk\nThe Group operates in highly competitive markets and often competes directly with large multi-national corporations who have greater resources and are more established. This risk has become more concentrated over recent years following a series of mergers and acquisitions by competitors creating larger entities. The major oil service and equipment company consolidations have magnified such issues as competitors reduce in number but increase in size, influence, and reach. Unforeseen product innovation or technical advances by competitors could adversely affect the Group, and lead to a slower take up of the Group's proprietary technology. To mitigate this risk, Plexus has an active R&D programme, and maintains an extensive suite of patents and trademarks, and actively continues to develop and improve its IP, including adding to its existing extensive 'know-how' to ensure that it continues to be able to offer unique superior wellhead design solutions.\n(e)\nOperational\nThe Group operates in highly competitive markets, often directly against large multi-national corporations who have greater resources, are more established and have a larger geographical footprint. As a smaller group, the main operational risk is not obtaining work due to availability of equipment and resources. Plexus is mitigating this risk by focussing on increasing its rental fleet, and attempting to increase its geographical reach, by targeting work in new regions.\n(f)\nGoing Concern, liquidity, and finance requirements\nAs a relatively small business with adequate, but not excess cash resources, and following a number of loss-making years, Plexus has to closely monitor and manage cash flow. Additionally, Plexus' smaller market cap can be a negative factor if consideration is given to raising additional funds in the public markets.\nThe Group undertakes cashflow forecasting throughout the year to ensure the going-concern assumption is still appropriate. As disclosed, the Group is reliant on raising additional funding,\nan event that was indicated at the time the convertible loan arrangements were entered into in October 2022, and there can be no certainty regarding the timing and quantum of future funding and therefore this indicates a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt regarding the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.\n(g)\nCredit\nThe main credit risk is attributable to trade receivables. Where the Group's customers are large international oil and gas companies the risk of non-payment is significantly reduced, and therefore is more likely to be related to client satisfaction. Where smaller independent oil and gas companies are concerned, credit risk can be a factor. Customer payments can potentially involve extended payment terms. This risk can be mitigated by agreeing structured payment terms on larger value contracts with milestone stage payments. The Group's exposure to credit risk is monitored continuously, and to date its collections record has been extremely reliable.\n(h)\nRisk assessment\nThe Board has established an on-going process for identifying, evaluating, and managing significant risk areas faced by the Group. One of the Board's control documents is a detailed \"Risks assessment & management document,\" which categorises risks in terms of: business area (which includes IT), compliance, finance, cash, receivables, fixed assets, other debtors/prepayments, creditors, legal, and personnel. These risks are assessed and updated as and when appropriate and can be associated with a variety of internal and external sources including regulatory requirements, disruption to information systems including cyber-crime, control breakdowns and social, ethical, environmental and health and safety issues.\nSection 172 Statement\nThis section serves as the section 172 statement and should be read in conjunction with the full Strategic Report and the Corporate Governance Report. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 requires directors to take into consideration the interests of stakeholders in their decision making. The Directors continue to have regard to the interests of the Company's employees and other stakeholders, including shareholders, customers and suppliers, Licence Partners and the community and environment, through positive engagement and when making decisions. Acting in good faith and fairly between members, the Directors consider what is most likely to promote the success of the Company for its members in the long term and to protect the reputation of the Company.\nShareholders\nPlexus seeks to develop an investor base of long-term shareholders that are aligned to our strategy, whether institutional or private retail investors. By communicating our strategy and objectives, we seek to maintain continued support from our investor base. Important issues include financial stability and the strength of the statement of financial position and protecting and strengthening the value of our intellectual property. Engagement with shareholders is a key element to this objective and methods of engagement are detailed in the Corporate Governance Report. During the year, the Finance Director supported by other members of the executive team, the Company's broker, and the Investor Relations advisor, engaged where possible with investors by email, presentations, direct conversations, and ad-hoc meetings. The Company also continues to update its website to provide investors and other stakeholders with access to information about the Company. During the year, several key decisions were made by the Board, including extending the licensing agreement with SLB which raised funds of $5.2m. This fund-raising related decision was aimed at increasing shareholder value.\nEmployees\nThe Group's UK staff are engaged by the Company's subsidiary Plexus Ocean Systems Limited based in Aberdeen, Scotland. As a relatively small company with fewer than 40 employees largely operating in one location, there is a high level of visibility regarding employee engagement and satisfaction. The Company is engaged with a specialist firm of benefits advisers who can offer a comprehensive service to employees as well as to the Company. The Company consults with employees on matters of competency, training, and health and safety as detailed in the Corporate Governance Report. Since the last report, the Company successfully achieved nine continuous years with no Lost Time Injuries (\"LTI\") and this successful safety culture has continued beyond that anniversary to the date of writing.\nCustomers and Suppliers\nThe Company is committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all business dealings and relationships. Fostering good business relationships with key stakeholders including customers and suppliers is important to the Company's success. The Board seeks to implement and enforce effective systems and controls to ensure its supply chain is maintaining the highest standard of business conduct in line with best practice including in relation to anti-bribery and modern slavery.\nLicence Partners\nThe Company engages with Licence Partners in a way that follows the same principles as those applied to relationships with other customers and suppliers. Additionally, the Company engages with its Licence Partners to support their efforts to achieve commercial success by holding, as and when required, technical workshops, technical training, and data transfer. Following the announcement in November 2020 of entering into a non-exclusive surface wellhead licencing agreement with Cameron (SLB) and the extension of this agreement in December 2021, and the further agreement signed in December 2023, regular Teams meetings and occasional face to face meetings have been held as part of the process of transferring Plexus' relevant IP so that Cameron can design and develop its own low-cost wellhead with POS-GRIP technology inside. In May 2023 SLB exercised its option to extend its non-exclusive licence agreement with Plexus for an additional six years effective from November 2023. This was then the followed with the additional licensing agreement in December 2023.\nCommunity and Environment\nThe Company has minimal environmental impact in the localities in which it operates. This clearly helps the Company meet its corporate objectives in this regard but is never taken for granted. In the year under review, the Company met its target for waste management and in general continues to operate in a manner that is open, honest, and socially responsible.\nM Park\nChief Financial

Segment Reporting\nThe Group derives revenue from the sale of its POS-GRIP technology and associated products, the rental of equipment utilising the POS-GRIP technology and service income principally derived in assisting with the commissioning and on-going service requirements of our equipment. These income streams are all derived from the utilisation of the technology which the Group believes is its only segment.\nPer IFRS 8, the operating segment is based on internal reports about components of the group, which are regularly reviewed and used by the board of directors being the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\").\nAll of the Group's non-current assets are held in the UK.\nThe following customers each account for more than 10% of the Group's continuing revenue:\n2024\n2023\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nCustomer 1\n7,644\n524\nCustomer 2\n4,082\n444\nCustomer 3\n-\n235\nCustomer 4\n-\n156\n3.

The deferred tax asset relates to losses to the value of the deferred tax losses and is reviewed at the end of each reporting period. The Group has previously recognised a deferred tax asset based upon its mid-term forecast profitability. On the basis losses have not been fully utilised in the current financial year management consider that the probable threshold is not met and have released the asset to the extent there are not sufficient taxable temporary differences. Once this threshold can be demonstrated an asset will be recognised. At 30 June 2024 the Group has tax losses available of \u00a321.4m (2023: \u00a324.5m).\n4.\nProfit / (loss) per share\n2024\n2023\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nProfit / (loss) attributable to shareholders\n2,933\n(4,015)\n-----\n-----\nNumber\nNumber\nWeighted average number of shares in issue\n103,576,297\n100,435,744\nDilution effects of share schemes\n-\n-\n----------\n----------\nDiluted weighted average number of shares in issue\n103,576,297\n100,435,744\n----------\n----------\nLoss per share\nBasic Earning / (loss) per share\n2.83p\n(4.00p)\nDiluted Earning / (loss) per share\n2.83p\n(4.00p)\n------\n------\nBasic loss per share is calculated on the results attributable to ordinary shares divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.\nDiluted earnings per share calculations include additional shares to reflect the dilutive effect of share option schemes.

Management considers this to be appropriate for a new technology gaining industry acceptance;\n\u00b7\nPrices will rise with inflation;\n\u00b7\nCosts, in particular direct costs and staff costs, are based on past experiences and management's knowledge of the industry.\nThese assumptions were determined from the directors' knowledge and experience.\nThe value in use calculation is based on cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial model information available. Although the Group's technology is proven and has proven commercial value the exploitation of opportunities beyond the rental wellhead exploration equipment services market are at a relatively early stage and the commercialisation process is expected to be a long term one. The cash flow forecasts therefore extend to 2044 to ensure the full benefit of all current projects is realised. The rationale for using a timescale up to 2044 with growth projections which increase in the first five years and decline thereafter, is that as time progresses, Plexus expects to gain an increasing foothold in the surface, subsea and other equipment markets, including the recent re-entry into the Jack-up exploration rental wellhead sector. This has been evidenced with an increase in enquiries following the work undertaken in the year on the major rental contract. As the Group is starting from a base point of trading, the growth rates are expected to be high in the initial years then in later years, where the technology becomes established, the expected rate of growth declines.\nThe key assumptions used in these calculations include the discount rate (10.87%), revenue projections, growth rates, expected gross margins and the lifespan of the Group's technology.\nManagement estimates the discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the Group and the markets in which it operates. Revenue projections, growth rates, margins and technology lifespans are all estimated based on the latest business models and the most recent discussions with customers, suppliers and other business partners.\nManagement regularly assesses the sensitivity of the key assumptions, including a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate flexing it by 5% both positively and negatively. It would require significant adjustments to key assumptions before the goodwill and other intangibles would be impaired.\nPatent and other development costs are internally generated.\nThe impairment review has been conducted on two CGUs, split by the category of IP: Deepwater and Conventional.\n6.\nProperty plant and equipment\nBuildings\n\u00a3000\nTenant\nImprovements\n\u00a3000\nEquipment\n\u00a3000\nAssets under construction\n\u00a3000\nMotor vehicles\n\u00a3000\nTotal\n\u00a3000\nCost\nAs at 30 June 2022\n685\n844\n5,360\n-\n17\n6,906\nAdditions\n-\n15\n123\n752\n-\n890\nTransfers\n-\n-\n367\n(367)\n-\n-\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\nAs at 30 June 2023\n685\n859\n5,850\n385\n17\n7,796\nAdditions\n-\n-\n183\n2,881\n-\n3,064\nTransfers\n-\n-\n2,862\n(2,862)\n-\n-\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\nAs at 30 June 2024\n685\n859\n8,895\n404\n17\n10,860\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\nDepreciation\nAs at 30 June 2022\n685\n606\n4,779\n-\n15\n6,085\nCharge for the year\n-\n74\n231\n-\n2\n307\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\nAs at 30 June 2023\n685\n680\n5,010\n-\n17\n6,392\nCharge for the year\n-\n76\n484\n-\n-\n560\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\nAs at 30 June 2024\n685\n756\n5,494\n-\n17\n6,952\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\nNet book value\nAs at 30 June 2024\n-\n103\n3,401\n404\n-\n3,908\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\nAs at 30 June 2023\n-\n179\n840\n385\n-\n1,404\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\nDuring the year additions to Assets under construction included \u00a31,160k previously recognised in inventory.\nThe value in use of property, plant and equipment is not materially different from the carrying value.\n7.

The four new wellhead systems are planned for deployment in early 2026, and will be required to meet current enquiry levels, with a further four sets to be ordered for delivery during Q4 2026.\nIn addition to the key strategic market sector of rental wellheads, the Company continues to pursue opportunities in sold production wellhead equipment and special projects, which are also expected to have some impact in 2026.\nPlexus continues to strengthen its position in key international markets, including the Middle East, where a senior sales manager has relocated to establish a permanent presence and where partnership with its local representative, Peak Energy Solutions, has been further expanded. The Company is currently preparing wellhead rental equipment for an exploration well in the UAE, and a permanent presence in this region will enable Plexus to capitalise on more opportunities in the future.\nIn the UK sector, government policy on maintaining the EPL on production and blocking exploration licences has led to uncertainty on the timing of plug and abandonment (\"P&A\") and decommissioning projects and subdued exploration activity. However, many opportunities still remain for Plexus, including carbon capture and storage (\"CCS\") wells and hydrogen storage, and P&A and decommissioning projects will be undertaken once operators commit to the necessary expenditures. The Board is encouraged by the Company's pipeline of business for H2 FY26 and beyond, and the Company's results for FY26 are expected to be in line with market expectations.\nLoan Facility\nPlexus has entered into a \u00a32 million Loan Facility with OFM Holdings Limited, a company wholly owned by a trust of which Chairman Ben Van Bilderbeek is settlor. The Loan Facility will be used to manage the Group's working capital requirements in the second half of FY26 following the deferral of certain projects into this period. Plexus' pipeline remains strong, and management continues to expect an improvement in activity levels later in FY26 and beyond, with growing opportunities in overseas markets.\nThe Loan Facility will enable Plexus to maintain momentum in delivering on its strategic plans and operational capability during this period, while positioning the Group to take advantage of the anticipated opportunities.\nKey terms of the Loan Facility:\n\u00b7\nFacility amount: up to \u00a32,000,000, available for draw down in tranches.\n\u00b7\nLender: OFM Holdings Limited, a company connected to Plexus' Chairman, Ben Van Bilderbeek.\n\u00b7\nPurpose: working capital support.\n\u00b7\nInterest: 8% per annum, with the first six months' interest rolled into the capital balance, thereafter payable monthly.\n\u00b7\nTerm: repayable in full by 31 December 2028, with an option to extend by mutual consent.\n\u00b7\nSecurity: second ranking debenture over certain Company assets, including intellectual property and manufacturing records.\n\u00b7\nEarly repayment: permitted at any time without penalty.\nRelated Party Transaction\nThe provision of the Loan Facility by OFM Holdings Limited, a company connected to Ben van Bilderbeek (a Director of the Company), constitutes a related party transaction for the purposes of Rule 13 of the AIM Rules. The Company's directors (excluding Ben van Bilderbeek, who is interested in the transaction) consider, having consulted with the Company's nominated adviser\n, Cavendish Capital Markets Limited, that the terms of the transaction are fair and reasonable insofar as its shareholders are concerned.\nPlexus CEO Craig Hendrie said:\n\"We are encouraged to see growing momentum internationally as operators recognise the value of Plexus' technology and, with a permanent presence now established in the Middle East and strengthened relationships with our local partners, we are particularly well placed to capture emerging opportunities in this key region and beyond. Whilst the timings of certain projects in the North Sea are uncertain, this loan facility provides the financial flexibility to stay agile, deliver on our strategic priorities, and ensure we are ready to capitalise on overseas growth as it accelerates. Accordingly, we remain disciplined, but we are optimistic about the pace of recovery in global energy markets.\"\nBen van Bilderbeek, Founder and Chairman of Plexus Holdings PLC, commented:\n\"The decision to extend a loan facility to Plexus reflects continued confidence in the value of our patented POS-GRIP\u00ae friction-grip wellhead technology, in the Exact EX rental wellhead business, and in the long-term potential.\n\"Following the industry downturn in 2015, Plexus preserved its approved wellhead-supplier status and core HP/HT capabilities through targeted project work, disciplined cost management, and selective asset disposals.\n\"Re-establishing the Company's Exact EX Jack-up Exploration drilling rental business has required the design and prototype of a new Jack-up adjustable wellhead system, completion of qualification testing, securing a field-trial operator, and raising capital to restore essential rental inventory. Plexus has been working hard on building a fleet of wellhead units to be able to take on several simultaneous projects in international locations, and I now see this business beginning to gain traction.\"\nENDS\nFor further information please visit\nwww.plexusplc.com\nor contact:\nPlexus Holdings PLC\nCraig Hendrie, CEO\nMike Park, CFO\nTel: 01224 774222\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\nDerrick Lee\nTel: 0131 220 6939\nSt Brides Partners Ltd\nIsabel de Salis\nPaul Dulieu\nWill Turner\nplexus@stbridespartners.co.uk\nNOTES\nPlexus Holdings plc (AIM: POS) is an IP-led company specialising in developing and providing wellhead systems and associated products and services for offshore operations.\nHeadquartered in Aberdeen, the company focuses on providing wellheads for Jack-up rig operations such as exploration and appraisal drilling, Plug & Abandonment work and emerging markets for Carbon Capture & Storage, hydrogen production and storage and geothermal. Plexus has a collaboration agreement with SLB to supply Exact adjustable wellhead systems for Jack-up applications and supports these operations with a range of proprietary equipment and tools, and project engineering services.\nPlexus is known for its highly innovative POS-GRIP\u00ae wellhead technology and HG\u00ae metal-to-metal sealing systems, for which licences have been sold to major industry players such as SLB and TechnipFMC for limited applications. Plexus continues to develop products based on POS-GRIP technology for challenging surface production wellhead platforms, special projects and connector and subsea applications such as the Python\u00ae subsea wellhead system.\nPlexus has always been at the forefront of innovation to reduce risk and improve performance in the energy industry, such as developing through-BOP wellhead systems which help to prevent blow-outs, and POS-GRIP \"HG\" Seals which are leak-free throughout field life and so reduce methane emissions and minimise maintenance costs. These innovations support the oil and gas industry's ESG and NetZero, and in recognition of this, Plexus was Awarded the London Stock Exchange's Green Economy Mark in 2021.\nFor more information visit:\nhttps://www.plexusplc.com/\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
