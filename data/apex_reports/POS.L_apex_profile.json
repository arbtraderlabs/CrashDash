At the AGM, CEO Craig Hendrie will make the following statement on behalf of Non-Executive Chair Ben Van Bilderbeek:\n\"The past year has been one of rebuilding and repositioning for Plexus. While our reported results reflect a deliberate investment phase following an exceptional prior year, we made solid operational progress, strengthened the balance sheet and continued to invest in the long-term capability of the business. In particular, we focused on expanding our rental wellhead inventory, which sits at the heart of our short-term growth strategy.\n\"Looking ahead, our focus remains on disciplined execution. During 2026, we expect to have 16 Exact rental wellhead systems available for deployment, creating a larger, high quality asset base. This inventory is intended to support repeat utilisation across multiple projects and geographies and provide more predictable and resilient revenue streams.\n\"We are cautiously encouraged by the outlook across our key markets. Rental operations are expected to commence imminently in the Middle East, where we now have a permanent presence, and North America during 2026, alongside further opportunities in the North Sea. Notably, our technology is particularly well suited to jack-up drilling, decommissioning and CCS applications, where activity levels are forecast to improve.\n\"Beyond the rental fleet, Plexus has a strong and differentiated suite of intellectual property that is ready for deployment. This includes further applications of POS-GRIP Technology, such as the Python subsea wellhead system, which will provide significant value over time both in rental and production applications\n\"Taken together, these developments provide a solid platform for the next phase of the Group's development. This confidence is shared at Board level, as evidenced by several board members including myself taking part in the March 2025 fundraise and my \u00a32 million loan to the Company towards the end of the year, which underlines our strong belief in Plexus' strategy.\n\"With an expanded rental fleet, multiple market drivers across key geographies, and a continued focus on cost control and delivery, the Board remains confident that Plexus is well positioned to build sustainable value for shareholders over the medium term.\"\nENDS\nFor further information please visit\nwww.plexusplc.com\nor contact:\nPlexus Holdings PLC\nCraig Hendrie, CEO\nMike Park, CFO\nTel: 01224 774222\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\nDerrick Lee\nTel: 0131 220 6939\nSt Brides Partners Ltd\nIsabel de Salis\nPaul Dulieu\nWill Turner\nplexus@stbridespartners.co.uk\nNOTES\nPlexus Holdings plc (AIM: POS) (\nwww.plexusplc.com\n) is an Aberdeen-headquartered specialist in innovative wellhead systems and related products for offshore operations.

While last year's \u00a32.93m profit was driven by a one-off licence transaction, this year the Group reported a loss before tax of \u00a33.27m which is consistent with our strategic decision to reinvest in the rental model and strengthen\nour rental operations\n.\n\"Operationally, we delivered steady activity in the North Sea, although several projects scheduled for the period were postponed due to continued uncertainty in the region.\nThe lack of clarity around proposed changes to the Energy Profits Levy has slowed not only new exploration and development drilling but also decommissioning and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) work across the UK.\n\"In response, we increased our focus on international markets. With new rental work on track to commence in the USA and Middle East in Q1 2026, we are actively building a pipeline of follow-on opportunities. The Middle East remains a key strategic region and to support growth we have appointed a Business Development manager who is now based in the United Arab Emirates.\n\"These steps give us a strong foundation to advance the wider suite of POS GRIP applications that Plexus retains. This includes HG-R production wellhead remediation technology, HG Trees, Plug and Abandonment (P&A) products, and subsea infrastructure solutions\nsuch as the Python subsea wellhead system.\n\"As the new CEO of Plexus, I would like to thank Ben van Bilderbeek for his continued leadership and oversight as Chairman, and to welcome Stuart Paton to the board as a Non-Executive Director.\nTheir experience and support will be invaluable as we execute the next phase of our strategy.\"\nFor further information please visit\nwww.plexusplc.com\nor contact:\nPlexus Holdings PLC\nCraig Hendrie, CEO\nMike Park, CFO\nTel: 01224 774222\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\nDerrick Lee\nTel: 0131 220 6939\nSt Brides Partners Ltd\nIsabel de Salis\nPaul Dulieu\nWill Turner\nplexus@stbridespartners.co.uk\nChairman's Statement\nBusiness progress\nThis has been a year of meaningful operational progress. A key highlight was securing a major gas exploration contract in the Middle East, which will utilise our Exact Jack\u2011up rental wellhead equipment. Although originally scheduled to commence in the second half of 2025, the project is now expected to begin in the first quarter of 2026, generating revenues of approximately $1 million. To support this contract, Plexus completed the build of four new sets of Exact rental wellhead equipment in March 2025, ensuring readiness for deployment.\nWe also saw the completion of a special North Sea project in December 2024, which generated revenues of more than \u00a39 million, demonstrating our engineering expertise and ability to deliver complex offshore solutions. Furthermore, in June 2025, Plexus completed the first phase of a North Sea Dutch sector P&A contract, generating \u00a31.9 million in revenues, with operations scheduled to resume in 2026.\nApril 2025 was a pivotal month for the Company when we successfully raised \u00a33.5 million (\u00a33.15 million net of expenses) at 6.5p per share, alongside the conversion of \u00a30.7 million in outstanding loan notes. This provided capital for further expansion of the Exact rental fleet, enabling Plexus to capitalise on growing demand for Jack\u2011up rental wellheads in exploration and P&A projects, and also strengthened the balance sheet. During the same period, the first four new sets of Exact wellheads were ordered, with delivery expected in January 2026 ahead of deployment in Q1 2026.\nInnovation and diversification remained central to operations. In May 2025, Plexus completed the pre\u2011engineering phase of a North Sea subsea intervention project, which subsequently saw our subsea wellhead rental equipment deployed post year end. Research and development expenditure amounted to \u00a3442k (2024: \u00a3558k), reflecting ongoing investment in patents and product development to protect and expand the Company's technology portfolio.\nQuality assurance also remained a priority. Plexus successfully completed its annual API audit, retaining its API Q1 accreditation and transitioning seamlessly to API Q1 10th Edition, reinforcing the Company's commitment to industry standards and operational excellence.\nFinancial Performance\nFor the year to 30 June 2025, the Group delivered revenues of \u00a34.48m, compared to \u00a312.72m in 2024 and recorded a loss before tax of \u00a33.3m, compared to a profit of \u00a32.8m in the prior year. The 2025 results reflect the planned investment phase as we rebuild and expand our rental operations, while the 2024 financial performance was boosted by an exceptional licence deal, creating an unusually strong comparative year.\nIntellectual Property\nPlexus' intellectual property and decades-long record of invention and innovation remain a core differentiator. Over the past year, Plexus strengthened its position in the Jack-up wellhead business, supported by the \u00a33.5 million raise in April 2025 to double our Exact-EX rental fleet. This puts us in a strong position to meet increasing demand for Jack-up rental wellheads, particularly for exploration and P&A projects.\nPOS-GRIP\u00ae Technology remains central to Plexus' strategy and value. After a period of development, we expect SLB to see some benefit from integrating POS-GRIP into its surface wellhead product lines this year. Plexus retains full rights to subsea and special applications, with a longer-term strategy to broaden its product range and explore licensing opportunities with other service companies. With an underlying base of revenue expected to kick in from the rental business, Plexus will soon be able to focus again on commercialising the remaining POS-GRIP applications.\nStaff\nOn behalf of the Board, I would like to thank our employees for their hard work and commitment during the year. Their commitment has been critical in growing our rental inventory, maintaining our technical capability, and ensuring we are prepared to capitalise on rising activity across our key markets.\nOutlook\nLooking ahead, despite ongoing challenges in sentiment towards offshore oil and gas, we remain highly optimistic. Global demand for Jack up rigs is strong, and our technology is well suited to P&A, CCS, and geothermal applications. By focusing on shorter lead time opportunities, deepening collaboration with SLB, and building on our intellectual property base, we have positioned the Group for sustainable and diversified growth.\nIn closing, I would like to thank the Board, our new Executive team, the Aberdeen management group, and all staff for their continued hard work and support. Together, we are committed to delivering on our overriding objective: generating increasing value for our shareholders in the year ahead.\nBen van Bilderbeek\nNon-Executive Chairman\n18 December 2025\nStrategic Report\nThe Directors present their strategic report for the year ended 30 June 2025.\nPrincipal Activity\nThe Group provides wellhead equipment and related equipment and services, for oil and gas drilling and production, carbon capture and storage, \"CCS\", and well plug and abandonment \"P&A\" activities. Plexus specialises in adjustable wellhead equipment which has particular benefits for work based on Jack-up rigs. Other specialised equipment based on Plexus POS-GRIP Technology are also offered.\nBusiness review\nA review of the development and performance of the business during the year consistent with its size and complexity, together with commentary on future developments including the main trends and factors likely to affect the business, is given in the Chairman's Statement. Where guidelines refer to the provision of key performance indicators, the directors are of the opinion certain financial and non-financial indicators included in the highlights, and the Directors' Report section of the Annual Report meet this requirement. The Directors have provided a description of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group in the Annual Report.\nFinancial Results\nStatement of Comprehensive Income\nRevenue\nRevenue for the year was \u00a34,481k, a decrease from \u00a312,723k in the prior year. Revenue in the first half of the year was dominated by the completion of the major rental project, generating \u00a32,073k. Following successful completion efforts were then focused on growing the underlying organic business.\nLast year's revenue figure had been particularly high due to the major rental project (\u00a37,644k) and the one off SLB licensing agreement (\u00a34,082k).\nMargin\nGross margin has decreased from 72.17% in the prior year to 51.42% in the current year.\nA year-to-year comparison of gross margin adds little value given prior year revenues included the one off SLB licensing agreement which had no associated cost of sale. Additionally, due to investment in the rental fleet over the last two years, rental asset depreciation (included in cost of sales) has increased from \u00a3321k in the prior year to \u00a3681k in the current year.\nOverhead expenses\nAdministrative expenses have remained broadly in line with the prior year at \u00a35,550k compared to \u00a35,579k in the prior year.\nContinuing salary and benefit costs remain the largest component of administrative expenses at \u00a33,142k compared to \u00a33,267k in the prior year.\n(Loss) / profit Before Tax\nThe loss before tax of \u00a33,266k compares to a profit before tax of \u00a32,803k in the prior year,\nAdjusted EBITDA\nThe Directors use, amongst other things, Adjusted EBITDA as a non-GAAP measure to assess the Group's financial performance. The Directors consider Adjusted EBITDA to be the most appropriate measure of the underlying financial performance of the Group in the period.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year was a loss of \u00a31,073k, compared to a profit of \u00a35,446k in the previous year.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash at the year-end was \u00a32,537k compared to \u00a32,486k in the prior year, reflecting a net cash inflow for the year of \u00a351k. A further analysis of cash movements can be found in the statement of cash flows.\nThe expected future cash inflows and the cash balances held are anticipated to be adequate to meet current on-going working capital, capital expenditure, R&D, and project related\ncommitments. This expectation is subject to satisfaction of the two matters identified within the going concern assessment.\nConvertible loans\nIn April 2025 the convertible loans which had a value of \u00a3856k at the last reporting date, were fully converted into equity as part of a fundraising event.\nShare Capital and Share Premium\nFollowing the successful fundraise in April 2025, 67,305,127 new ordinary shares were issued, increasing share capital from \u00a31,054k to \u00a31,727k, creating a share premium of \u00a33,353k.\nThe share premium is net of share issue costs of \u00a3349k and includes the crystallised loan note premium of \u00a3175k, following the convertible loan noteholders' participation in the fundraise.\nDividends\nThe Company has not paid any dividends in the year and does not propose to pay a final dividend. Whilst the Company remains committed to distributing dividends to its shareholders when appropriate, the Directors believe that it is prudent to suspend the payment of dividends considering the ongoing capital and operational requirements of the business.\nOperations\nThe Group's primary focus during the first half of the financial year was the successful completion of the major contract noted in the operational overview, which generated \u00a32,073k of revenue during the year. Primary focus then shifted to growing the Group's revenue through the utilisation of its Exact equipment, which generated circa \u00a32,160k of revenue in the year.\nPlexus continued to invest in R&D during the year, with significant focus on optimising the Exact rental exploration wellhead product range for the current market. R&D remains an important operational activity and further develops the value of our IP and ability to extend the range of applications of our technology.\nStaff at the end of June 2025 (excluding non-executive directors) comprised of 39 employees (2024: 37 employees, including one international employee), with a weighted average total of 38 which is an increase of 2 from the prior year.\nStaff development remains a key priority, supported by a thorough evaluation and revision of the appraisal system. The updated process empowers both employees and line managers to maximise the value of performance reviews and continuously identify development opportunities.\nThe Company continues to maintain the OPITO accreditation for its competency management system, with continual developments and improvements to the process, ensuring a robust assessment of employees in safety--critical roles.\nHealth and Safety continues to be a fundamental priority for the business and remains central to all operations. Plexus is fully committed to the continuous improvement of safety standards and the reinforcement of a strong safety culture across the organisation. This ongoing commitment is demonstrated by the Company achieving another year without a lost time injury (\"LTI\"), and as of September 2025, Plexus reached its tenth consecutive year without an LTI - a significant milestone that reflects the sustained focus on safe working practices.\nPlexus continues to operate in full compliance with the requirements of the API Q1/ISO 9001 and ISO 45001 standards, ensuring the continued retention of both API 6A and API 17D licences. These accreditations reaffirm Plexus' capability, integrity, and commitment to maintaining the highest industry standards. During the reporting period, an API audit was successfully completed, with Plexus retaining its API Q1 accreditation, including the successful transition to the 10th Edition of API Q1.\nThe IT department continues to play a critical role in supporting Plexus's operational efficiency, security, and digital innovation. Over the past year, there has been focus on strengthening infrastructure to ensure business continuity and data protection.\nA key achievement has been the successful implementation of an\noff-site disaster recovery solution\n, designed to provide robust coverage in the event of a large-scale disruption. This solution ensures that critical systems and data can be restored quickly and securely, minimising downtime and operational impact.\nIn parallel, we have deployed a\nmore resilient on-site backup strategy\n. This includes enhanced protection for both cloud-based and locally stored data, ensuring comprehensive coverage and faster recovery times. These improvements significantly bolster our ability to safeguard Plexus's digital assets and maintain service continuity under adverse conditions.\nStrategy and Future Developments\nPlexus has been involved in the design of specialised wellhead equipment for the offshore market for over 40 years, and this history and knowledge continues to drive the products and services that are offered.\nIn 2021, Plexus licenced the Exact wellhead and Centric mudline systems back from SLB and set about updating and improving this product range to compete in the current market. This has resulted in the Exact-EX adjustable wellhead system, which is optimised for use on modern Jack-up rigs when they are used for exploration drilling, development, or CCS pre-drilling or P&A activities. This optimised system is significantly more cost effective than competing through-BOP adjustable wellheads, and Plexus is developing a fleet of rental wellhead systems to be deployed in this market, which forms the core of the short-term business growth. The Middle East remains an important and busy area of activity for exploration drilling; Plexus has made an initial breakthrough into this market through a contract secured in late 2024 with operations now expected to go live in Q1 of 2026. This region in particular is expected to become an area of growth and to support this we have appointed a Business Development manager based in the United Arab Emirates.\nPlexus retains the right to offer POS-GRIP surface production for small projects of less than four systems and in specialised applications such as adjustable wellheads. These types of opportunities are usually 12 months or more in the planning and manufacturing stages, and so this market sector will continue to be developed as a medium-term growth objective.\nIn both the medium and the longer term, Plexus is working on leveraging the remaining applications of POS-GRIP, which are for subsea and other specialised applications. POS-GRIP has been successfully deployed in subsea applications recently, such as the Oceaneering P&A campaign and the recent special application. These projects have used technology from the Python subsea wellhead system, and such successful deployments are significant steps along the way of field-testing elements of the system, making a full deployment of the Python system more viable. Additionally, long term focus remains on developing other POS-GRIP products, such as valves to complement our proprietary wellheads for use in production applications and also potential further licencing of POS-GRIP technology in large volume markets.\nKey Performance Indicators\nThe Directors monitor the performance of the Group by reference to certain financial and non-financial key performance indicators. The financial indicators include revenue, adjusted EBITDA, profit/loss, earnings per share, cash balances, and working capital resources and requirements. The analysis of these is included in the financial results section of this report. Non-financial indicators include Health and Safety statistics, R&D activity, equipment utilisation rates, the level of ongoing customer interest and support. Several non-financial key performance indicators are included within the strategic report; customer\ninterest and equipment utilisation are monitored internally by senior management through regular meetings attended by departmental managers.\nPr\nincipal Risks and Risk Management\nThere are a number of potential risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the Group's performance, which include the following.\n(a)\nPolitical, legal, and environmental risks\nPlexus aims to participate in a global market where the exploration and production of oil and gas reserves, and the access to those reserves can be adversely impacted by changes in political, operational, and environmental circumstances. The current global political and environmental landscape, particularly in relation to climate change and net zero goals, continues to demonstrate how such factors can generate risks and uncertainties that can present a risk to trading. Such risks also extend to legal and regulatory issues, and it is important to understand that these can change at short notice. Regulatory changes can have an adverse impact on investment levels, as of course does a country's decision-making process in relation to granting new exploration and production drilling opportunities. To help address and balance such risks, the Group where possible seeks to broaden its geographic footprint and customer base, as well as actively looking to forge commercial relationships with large industry players, and potential licencees.\n(b)\nOil and Gas Sector Trends\nNew technologies, particularly in relation to renewables such as wind and solar, alternative energies and current developments such as the increasing use of electric vehicles could all in the future prove very disruptive to the traditional oil and gas industry and the corresponding demand for exploration and production equipment and services. To help mitigate this risk Plexus is committed to work in areas such as renewables, carbon capture and decommissioning, ensuring diversification from exploration and production.\n(c)\nTechnology\nIt is critical to the success of the Group to be able to anticipate changes in technology or in industry standards and to successfully develop and introduce new, enhanced and competitive products on a timely basis and keep pace with technological change.\nAs noted above the Company is committed to widening the application of its technology. In order to ensure that the Group's technology and IP develop, the Group commits resources annually to research and development and is open to completing sponsored R&D projects on behalf of customers. Additionally, senior management have regular meetings with key end-customers to maintain visibility over their technological requirements.\n(d)\nCompetitive risk\nThe Group operates in highly competitive markets and often competes directly with large multi-national corporations who have greater resources and are more established. This risk has become more concentrated over recent years following a series of mergers and acquisitions by competitors creating larger entities. The major oil service and equipment company consolidations have magnified such issues as competitors reduce in number but increase in size, influence, and reach. Unforeseen product innovation or technical advances by competitors could adversely affect the Group, and lead to a slower take up of the Group's proprietary technology. To mitigate this risk, Plexus has an active R&D programme, and maintains an extensive suite of patents and trademarks, and actively continues to develop and improve its IP, including adding to its existing extensive 'know-how' to ensure that it continues to be able to offer unique superior wellhead design solutions.\n(e)\nOperational\nThe Group operates in highly competitive markets, often directly against large multi-national corporations who have greater resources, are more established and have a larger geographical footprint. As a smaller group, the main operational risk is not obtaining work due to availability of equipment and resources. Plexus is mitigating this risk by focussing on increasing its rental fleet, and attempting to increase its geographical reach, by targeting work in new regions.\n(f)\nGoing Concern, liquidity, and finance requirements\nAs a relatively small business with adequate, but not excess cash resources, and following a number of loss-making years, Plexus has to closely monitor and manage cash flow. Additionally, Plexus' smaller market cap may limit its ability to raise additional funds in the public markets.\nThe Group undertakes cashflow forecasting throughout the year to ensure the going-concern assumption is still appropriate. The Group and Company are reliant on the receipt of the additional funding under the new loan facility and on converting currently uncontracted sales growth in 2026. Failure to achieve either matter would have a material impact on both the Group and Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, this indicates a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group and Company to continue as a going concern.\n(g)\nCredit\nThe main credit risk is attributable to trade receivables. Where the Group's customers are large international oil and gas companies the risk of non-payment is significantly reduced and more likely to be related to client satisfaction. Where smaller independent oil and gas companies are concerned, credit risk can be a factor. Customer payments can potentially involve extended payment terms. This risk can be mitigated by agreeing structured payment terms on larger value contracts with milestone stage payments. The Group's exposure to credit risk is monitored continuously, and to date its collections record has been extremely reliable.\n(h)\nRisk assessment\nThe Board has established an on-going process for identifying, evaluating, and managing significant risk areas faced by the Group. One of the Board's control documents is a detailed \"Risks assessment & management document,\" which categorises risks in terms of: business area (which includes IT), compliance, finance, cash, receivables, fixed assets, other debtors/prepayments, creditors, legal, and personnel. These risks are assessed and updated as and when appropriate and can be associated with a variety of internal and external sources including regulatory requirements, disruption to information systems including cyber-crime, control breakdowns and social, ethical, environmental and health and safety issues.\nSection 172 Statement\nThis section serves as the section 172 statement and should be read in conjunction with the full Strategic Report and the Corporate Governance Report in the Annual Report. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 requires directors to take into consideration the interests of stakeholders in their decision making. The Directors continue to have regard to the interests of the Company's employees and other stakeholders, including shareholders, customers and suppliers, Licence Partners and the community and environment, through positive engagement and when making decisions. Acting in good faith and fairly between members, the Directors consider what is most likely to promote the success of the Company for its members in the long term and to protect the reputation of the Company.\nShareholders\nPlexus seeks to develop an investor base of long-term shareholders that are aligned to our strategy, whether institutional or private retail investors. By communicating our strategy and objectives, we seek to maintain continued support from our investor base. Important issues include financial stability and the strength of the statement of financial position and protecting and strengthening the value of our intellectual property. Engagement with shareholders is a key element to this objective and methods of engagement are detailed in the Corporate Governance Report in the Annual Report. During the year, the Executive Directors supported by other members of the senior management team, the Company's broker, and the Investor Relations advisor, engaged where possible with investors by email, presentations, direct conversations, and ad-hoc meetings. The Company also continues to update its website to provide investors and other stakeholders with access to information about the Company. During the year, several key decisions were made by the Board, including the conversion of debt and issue of new shares, including an open offer to all shareholders, which raised gross funds of \u00a33.5m. This fund-raising related decision was aimed at increasing shareholder value.\nEmployees\nThe Group's UK staff are engaged by the Company's subsidiary Plexus Ocean Systems Limited based in Aberdeen, Scotland. As a relatively small company with fewer than 40 employees largely operating in one location, there is a high level of visibility regarding employee engagement and satisfaction. The Company is engaged with a specialist firm of benefits advisers who can offer a comprehensive service to employees as well as to the Company. The Company consults with employees on matters of competency, training, and health and safety as detailed in the Corporate Governance Report in the Annual Report. Since the last report, the Company successfully achieved ten continuous years with no Lost Time Injuries (\"LTI\") and this successful safety culture has continued beyond that anniversary to the date of writing.\nCustomers and Suppliers\nThe Company is committed to acting ethically and with integrity in all business dealings and relationships. Fostering good business relationships with key stakeholders including customers and suppliers is important to the Company's success. The Board seeks to implement and enforce effective systems and controls to ensure its supply chain is maintaining the highest standard of business conduct in line with best practice including in relation to anti-bribery and modern slavery.\nLicence Partners\nThe Company engages with Licence Partners in a way that follows the same principles as those applied to relationships with other customers and suppliers. Additionally, the Company engages with its Licence Partners to support their efforts to achieve commercial success by holding, as and when required, technical workshops, technical training, and data transfer. Following the announcement in November 2020 of entering into a non-exclusive surface wellhead licencing agreement with Cameron (SLB) and the extension of this agreement in December 2021, and the further agreement signed in December 2023. In May 2023 SLB exercised its option to extend its non-exclusive licence agreement with Plexus for an additional six years effective from November 2023. This was then the followed with the additional licensing agreement in December 2023.\nCommunity and Environment\nThe Company has minimal environmental impact in the localities in which it operates. This clearly helps the Company meet its corporate objectives in this regard but is never taken for granted. In the year under review, the Company met its target for waste management and in general continues to operate in a manner that is open, honest, and socially responsible.\nM Park\nChief Financial Officer\n18 December 2025\nConsolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income\nfor the year ended 30 June 2025\n2025\n\u00a3'000\n2024\n\u00a3'000\nRevenue\n4,481\n12,723\nCost of sales\n(2,177)\n(3,541)\n-------\n-------\nGross profit\n2,304\n9,182\nAdministrative expenses\n(5,550)\n(5,579)\nNon-recurring -

The deferred tax asset relates to losses to the value of the deferred tax losses and is reviewed at the end of each reporting period. The Group has previously recognised a deferred tax asset based upon its mid-term forecast profitability. On the basis losses have not been fully utilised in the current financial year management consider that the probable threshold is not met and have released the asset to the extent there are not sufficient taxable temporary differences. Once this threshold can be demonstrated an asset will be recognised. At 30 June 2025 the Group has tax losses available of \u00a324.5m (2024: \u00a321.4m).\n4.\n(Loss) / earnings per share\n2025\n2024\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n(Loss) / profit attributable to shareholders\n(3,266)\n2,933\n-----\n-----\nNumber\nNumber\nWeighted average number of shares in issue\n121,060,036\n103,576,297\nDilution effects of share schemes\n-\n-\n----------\n----------\nDiluted weighted average number of shares in issue\n121,060,036\n103,576,297\n----------\n----------\nLoss per share\n(Loss) / earnings per share\n(2.70p)\n2.83p\nDiluted (loss) / earnings per share\n(2.70p)\n2.83p\n------\n------\nBasic loss per share is calculated on the results attributable to ordinary shares divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.\nDiluted earnings per share calculations include additional shares to reflect the dilutive effect of share option schemes.

Management considers this to be appropriate for a new technology gaining industry acceptance;\n\u00b7\nPrices will rise with inflation;\n\u00b7\nCosts, in particular direct costs, and staff costs are based on past experiences, and management's knowledge of the industry.\nThese assumptions were determined from the directors' knowledge and experience.\nThe value in use calculation is based on pre-tax cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial model information available. Although the Group's technology is proven and has proven commercial value the exploitation of opportunities beyond the rental wellhead exploration equipment services market are at a relatively early stage and the commercialisation process is expected to be a long term one. The cash flow forecasts therefore extend to 2045 to ensure the full benefit of all current projects is realised. The rationale for using a timescale up to 2045 with growth projections which increase in the first five years and decline thereafter, is that as time\nprogresses, Plexus expects to gain an increasing foothold in the surface, subsea and other equipment markets, including the recent re-entry into the Jack-up exploration rental wellhead sector. This has been evidenced with an increase in enquiries following the work undertaken in the year on the major rental contract. As the Group is starting from a base point of trading the growth rates are expected to be high in the initial years then in later years where the technology becomes established the expected rate of growth declines. The 20-year span of the model is considered appropriate given the newly patented technology will have 20 years of protection. However, it should be noted that even after the expiry of patents, there is a great deal more in Plexus' products that doesn't mean that it is suddenly open technology when the patent expires. Additionally, Plexus has built-up decades worth of knowledge, test data and experience.\nAs Plexus operate in a highly competitive marketplace, which has cyclical periods of high M&A activity, the model takes two approaches, organic sales growth and a licensing route, whereby a CGU would be licensed to a partner and licensing revenues would be generated.\nThe key assumptions used in these calculations include the discount rate (10.87%), revenue projections, growth rates, expected gross margins and the lifespan of the Group's technology.\nManagement estimates the discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the Group and the markets in which it operates. Revenue projections, growth rates, margins and technology lifespans are all estimated based on the latest business models and the most recent discussions with customers, suppliers and other business partners.\nManagement regularly assesses the sensitivity of the key assumptions, including a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate flexing it by 5% both positively and negatively.\nIt should be noted that revenue level within the model to an extent are speculative, given the model has a 20 year reach. Given this, management have also produced a discounted cashflow model with reduced revenues which acts as a sensitized model and highlights and provides further evidence that impairment of the IP is not required. It would require significant adjustments to key assumptions before the goodwill and other intangibles would be impaired.\nPatent and other development costs are internally generated.\nThe impairment review has been conducted on two CGUs, split by the category of IP: Deepwater and Conventional.\n6.\nProperty plant and equipment\nBuildings\n\u00a3000\nTenant\nImprovements\n\u00a3000\nEquipment\n\u00a3000\nAssets under construction\n\u00a3000\nMotor vehicles\n\u00a3000\nTotal\n\u00a3000\nCost\nAs at 30 June 2023\n685\n859\n5,850\n385\n17\n7,796\nAdditions\n-\n-\n183\n2,881\n-\n3,064\nTransfers\n-\n-\n2,862\n(2,862)\n-\n-\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\nAs at 30 June 2024\n685\n859\n8,895\n404\n17\n10,860\nAdditions\n-\n-\n77\n1,551\n5\n1,633\nDisposals\n(892)\n(892)\nTransfers\n-\n-\n979\n(979)\n-\n-\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\nAs at 30 June 2025\n685\n859\n9,059\n976\n22\n11,601\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\nDepreciation\nAs at 30 June 2023\n685\n680\n5,010\n-\n17\n6,392\nCharge for the year\n-\n76\n484\n-\n-\n560\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\nAs at 30 June 2024\n685\n756\n5,494\n-\n17\n6,952\nCharge for the year\n-\n76\n798\n-\n-\n874\nDisposals\n(876)\n(876)\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\nAs at 30 June 2025\n685\n832\n5,416\n-\n17\n6,950\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\nNet book value\nAs at 30 June 2025\n-\n27\n3,643\n976\n5\n4,651\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\nAs at 30 June 2024\n-\n103\n3,401\n404\n-\n3,908\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\nThe value in use of property, plant and equipment is not materially different from the carrying value.\n7.\nShare Capital\n2025\n2024\n9\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nAuthorised:\nEquity: 172,691,366 (2024: 110,000,000) Ordinary shares of 1p each\n1,727\n1,100\n-----\n-----\nAllotted, called up and fully paid:\nEquity: 172,691,366 (2024: 105,386,239) Ordinary shares of 1p each\n1,727\n1,054\n-----\n-----\nShare issue in the year:\nNumber of shares\nShare capital\n\u00a3'000\nShare premium \u00a3'000\nTotal\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nAs at 30 June 2024\n105,386,239\n1,054\n-\n1,054\nOn 7th April 2025\n67,305,127\n673\n3,527\n4,200\nLess share issue costs\n-\n-\n(349)\n(349)\nCrystalised loan note premium\n-\n-\n175\n175\n----------\n-------\n-------\n-------\nAt 30 June 2025\n172,691,366\n1,727\n3,353\n5,080\n----------\n-------\n-------\n-------\n8.\nAnalysis of net debt\n2025:\nAt beginning of year\nCashflow\nNon-cash movements\nAt end of year\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3,000\n\u00a3'000\nCash and cash equivalents\n2,486\n51\n-\n2,537\nLease Liability\n(429)\n347\n(6)\n(88)\nConvertible loan notes\n(856)\n-\n856\n-\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\nTotal\n1,201\n398\n850\n2,449\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n2024:\nAt beginning\nof year\nCashflow\nNon-cash movements\nAt end of year\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nCash and cash equivalents\n1,449\n1,037\n-\n2,486\nLease Liability\n(761)\n347\n(15)\n(429)\nConvertible loan notes\n(1,702)\n1,020\n(174)\n(856)\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\nTotal\n(1,014)\n2,404\n(189)\n1,201\n-----\n-----\n-----\n-----\n9.\nConvertible loans\n\u00a3'000\nAmortised cost at 30 June 2023\n1,702\n-----\nRedemption premium to 31 January 2024\n113\nRepayment of Convertible loans\n(1,020)\nRedemption premium as a result of cash repayment\n25\n-----\nAmortised cost at 31 January 2024\n820\nRedemption premium\n36\n-----\nAmortised cost at 30 June 2024\n856\n-----\nRedemption premium\n19\nCrystalised Premium on conversion\n(175)\nConversion of loan notes\n(700)\n-----\nAmortised cost at 30 June 2025\n-\n-----\nIn October 2022 Plexus raised \u00a31,550,000 through the issue of 1,550,000 convertible loan notes. The loan notes were non-interest bearing and had an original maturity date being 24 months after issue, which was subsequently extended by 6 months in October 2024.\nThe loan notes could be settled in cash, with an additional 20% redemption interest on the principal amount or converted into new shares where the principal amount would be settled at a 20% discount to the share price paid by investors in a qualifying financing event. The 20% discount noted above equates to a 25% premium on the principal amount. Therefore, a redemption premium of \u00a3387,500 was recognised over the two-year term.\nOn 31 January 2024 it was announced that the company would make a cash payment to redeem \u00a3849,992 loan notes, plus redemption premium of \u00a3169,998, a total payment of \u00a31,019,990, leaving \u00a3700,008 loan notes outstanding.\nOn 19 March 2025 the company announced it would be undertaking a proposed fundraising event through the placing of new ordinary shares through a direct subscription and retail offering. This event was completed in April 2025. This constituted the qualifying financing event that would facilitate the conversion of the loan notes to equity.\nThe convertible loan note holders converted both the principal and the premium accrued of the outstanding convertible loan notes into new Ordinary Shares in the Company at the Conversion Price.\nThe total number of Conversion Shares is 13,461,692, comprising:\n\u00b7\nOFM Investment Limited: 8,333,442 conversion Shares\n\u00b7\nBen van Bilderbeek: 4,166,712 conversion Shares\n\u00b7\nJeffrey Thrall: 961,538 conversion Shares\n10. Subsequent Event\nOn 11 December 2025 the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement for a \u00a32m loan facility with OFM Holdings Limited, a company ultimately owned by a trust of which Ben van Bilderbeek is settlor. This loan facility will be used to manage the Group's working capital requirements in the second half of FY2026.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

          "content": "11 Dec 2025 07:00\nRNS Number : 0972L\nPlexus Holdings Plc\n11 December 2025\nThis announcement contains inside information\n11th December 2025\nPlexus Holdings PLC\n(\"Plexus\", the \"Company\" or the \"Group\")\nOperational Update and Loan Facility\nPlexus Holdings PLC (AIM: POS),\nthe AIM quoted wellhead services business\n, is pleased to provide an update on operations and trading for the year to 30 June 2026 (\"FY26\") and confirms that it has entered into an agreement for a loan facility of up to \u00a32 million (\"Loan Facility\") with OFM Holdings Limited (\"OFM\" or the \"Lender\").\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\u00b7\nFinancial performance for FY26 expected to be in line with market expectations.\n\u00b7\nFirst four new Exact\u2122 EX rental wellhead systems purchased from the Company's fundraising in March 2025 due for delivery by end of 2025, with the remaining four sets to be completed in 2026.\n\u00b7\n\u00a32 million Loan Facility secured to provide financial flexibility and support operations and strategic growth initiatives.\n\u00b7\nInternational footprint strengthened with a permanent presence established in the Middle East.\n\u00b7\nConfident in long-term outlook amid growing overseas opportunities and anticipated market recovery.\nOperations and Trading Update\nPlexus is pleased to confirm that it is completing manufacture of four new Exact\u2122 EX rental wellhead systems on schedule, to increase the Company's rental fleet to 12 sets. The four new wellhead systems are planned for deployment in early 2026, and will be required to meet current enquiry levels, with a further four sets to be ordered for delivery during Q4 2026.\nIn addition to the key strategic market sector of rental wellheads, the Company continues to pursue opportunities in sold production wellhead equipment and special projects, which are also expected to have some impact in 2026.\nPlexus continues to strengthen its position in key international markets, including the Middle East, where a senior sales manager has relocated to establish a permanent presence and where partnership with its local representative, Peak Energy Solutions, has been further expanded. The Company is currently preparing wellhead rental equipment for an exploration well in the UAE, and a permanent presence in this region will enable Plexus to capitalise on more opportunities in the future.\nIn the UK sector, government policy on maintaining the EPL on production and blocking exploration licences has led to uncertainty on the timing of plug and abandonment (\"P&A\") and decommissioning projects and subdued exploration activity. However, many opportunities still remain for Plexus, including carbon capture and storage (\"CCS\") wells and hydrogen storage, and P&A and decommissioning projects will be undertaken once operators commit to the necessary expenditures. The Board is encouraged by the Company's pipeline of business for H2 FY26 and beyond, and the Company's results for FY26 are expected to be in line with market expectations.\nLoan Facility\nPlexus has entered into a \u00a32 million Loan Facility with OFM Holdings Limited, a company wholly owned by a trust of which Chairman Ben Van Bilderbeek is settlor. The Loan Facility will be used to manage the Group's working capital requirements in the second half of FY26 following the deferral of certain projects into this period. Plexus' pipeline remains strong, and management continues to expect an improvement in activity levels later in FY26 and beyond, with growing opportunities in overseas markets.\nThe Loan Facility will enable Plexus to maintain momentum in delivering on its strategic plans and operational capability during this period, while positioning the Group to take advantage of the anticipated opportunities.\nKey terms of the Loan Facility:\n\u00b7\nFacility amount: up to \u00a32,000,000, available for draw down in tranches.\n\u00b7\nLender: OFM Holdings Limited, a company connected to Plexus' Chairman, Ben Van Bilderbeek.\n\u00b7\nPurpose: working capital support.\n\u00b7\nInterest: 8% per annum, with the first six months' interest rolled into the capital balance, thereafter payable monthly.\n\u00b7\nTerm: repayable in full by 31 December 2028, with an option to extend by mutual consent.\n\u00b7\nSecurity: second ranking debenture over certain Company assets, including intellectual property and manufacturing records.\n\u00b7\nEarly repayment: permitted at any time without penalty.\nRelated Party Transaction\nThe provision of the Loan Facility by OFM Holdings Limited, a company connected to Ben van Bilderbeek (a Director of the Company), constitutes a related party transaction for the purposes of Rule 13 of the AIM Rules. The Company's directors (excluding Ben van Bilderbeek, who is interested in the transaction) consider, having consulted with the Company's nominated adviser\n, Cavendish Capital Markets Limited, that the terms of the transaction are fair and reasonable insofar as its shareholders are concerned.\nPlexus CEO Craig Hendrie said:\n\"We are encouraged to see growing momentum internationally as operators recognise the value of Plexus' technology and, with a permanent presence now established in the Middle East and strengthened relationships with our local partners, we are particularly well placed to capture emerging opportunities in this key region and beyond. Whilst the timings of certain projects in the North Sea are uncertain, this loan facility provides the financial flexibility to stay agile, deliver on our strategic priorities, and ensure we are ready to capitalise on overseas growth as it accelerates. Accordingly, we remain disciplined, but we are optimistic about the pace of recovery in global energy markets.\"\nBen van Bilderbeek, Founder and Chairman of Plexus Holdings PLC, commented:\n\"The decision to extend a loan facility to Plexus reflects continued confidence in the value of our patented POS-GRIP\u00ae friction-grip wellhead technology, in the Exact EX rental wellhead business, and in the long-term potential.\n\"Following the industry downturn in 2015, Plexus preserved its approved wellhead-supplier status and core HP/HT capabilities through targeted project work, disciplined cost management, and selective asset disposals.\n\"Re-establishing the Company's Exact EX Jack-up Exploration drilling rental business has required the design and prototype of a new Jack-up adjustable wellhead system, completion of qualification testing, securing a field-trial operator, and raising capital to restore essential rental inventory. Plexus has been working hard on building a fleet of wellhead units to be able to take on several simultaneous projects in international locations, and I now see this business beginning to gain traction.\"\nENDS\nFor further information please visit\nwww.plexusplc.com\nor contact:\nPlexus Holdings PLC\nCraig Hendrie, CEO\nMike Park, CFO\nTel: 01224 774222\nCavendish Capital Markets Limited\nDerrick Lee\nTel: 0131 220 6939\nSt Brides Partners Ltd\nIsabel de Salis\nPaul Dulieu\nWill Turner\nplexus@stbridespartners.co.uk\nNOTES\nPlexus Holdings plc (AIM: POS) is an IP-led company specialising in developing and providing wellhead systems and associated products and services for offshore operations.\nHeadquartered in Aberdeen, the company focuses on providing wellheads for Jack-up rig operations such as exploration and appraisal drilling, Plug & Abandonment work and emerging markets for Carbon Capture & Storage, hydrogen production and storage and geothermal. Plexus has a collaboration agreement with SLB to supply Exact adjustable wellhead systems for Jack-up applications and supports these operations with a range of proprietary equipment and tools, and project engineering services.\nPlexus is known for its highly innovative POS-GRIP\u00ae wellhead technology and HG\u00ae metal-to-metal sealing systems, for which licences have been sold to major industry players such as SLB and TechnipFMC for limited applications. Plexus continues to develop products based on POS-GRIP technology for challenging surface production wellhead platforms, special projects and connector and subsea applications such as the Python\u00ae subsea wellhead system.\nPlexus has always been at the forefront of innovation to reduce risk and improve performance in the energy industry, such as developing through-BOP wellhead systems which help to prevent blow-outs, and POS-GRIP \"HG\" Seals which are leak-free throughout field life and so reduce methane emissions and minimise maintenance costs. These innovations support the oil and gas industry's ESG and NetZero, and in recognition of this, Plexus was Awarded the London Stock Exchange's Green Economy Mark in 2021.\nFor more information visit:\nhttps://www.plexusplc.com/\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
