Having protected the environment for many years through these technological innovations, the Company was awarded the London Stock Exchange's Green Economy Mark in July 2021 and continues to place emphasis on its ability to reduce harmful methane emissions and unnecessary maintenance and intervention costs.\nHeadquartered in Aberdeen, the Company has provided leak-free wellhead performance in over 400 wells worldwide and worked with an array of blue-chip oil and gas company clients. As well as generating direct revenues from securing orders for surface production wellheads particularly in the UK and European North Sea regions, the Company has several licencing/collaboration agreements with major partners including FMC Technologies, which is a subsidiary of TechnipFMC and Cameron, a Schlumberger Group company. Cameron has a non-exclusive licence to use the POS-GRIP and HG\u00ae metal-to-metal seal method of wellhead engineering for the development of conventional and unconventional oil and gas surface wellheads, and Plexus entered into a Cooperation Agreement, which enabled Plexus to return to the Jack-up Exploration (Adjustable) Wellhead rental business for 'through the BOP' jack-up applications, where Cameron will help to provide Plexus with sales leads and market insight through a formal Sales Advisory Board.\nPlexus' current suite of products and applications include: \"HG\" wellheads, which combine POS-GRIP technology with gas tight leak free metal-to-metal sealing; the Python\u00ae subsea wellhead, developed in a Joint Industry Project with several industry leaders; the POS-SET? Connector for the de-commissioning and P&A market; and Tersus-PCT, an innovative HP/HT tie back connector product. Having proved the superior uniquely enabling qualities of POS-GRIP Technology, Plexus is now also focused on establishing its technology and equipment in other markets such as Plug and Abandonment de-commissioning, carbon capture, gas storage, hydrogen and geothermal where it can play an important role in reducing harmful methane emission risks as operators strive to deliver on ESG commitments and NetZero goals in a safe and cost-effective way.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

As planned, the remaining four wellhead systems will be ordered shortly.\nProgress continues on the Middle East exploration well project, with equipment preparation and shipment to the UAE expected shortly. This contract is anticipated to generate approximately $1 million in revenue for the initial scope of the contract. The Company continues to see the region as a significant growth area and is actively pursuing further opportunities.\nAs announced in its Interim Results on 21 March 2025, the Company was contracted to develop subsea wellhead rental equipment for a specialised subsea intervention requirement. The fast track development and qualification testing for the equipment as now been successfully completed, and the equipment is now standing by, ready for imminent deployment offshore.\nIn North America, the Company has agreed terms for a new rental wellhead contract in the USA. The equipment is being prepared for shipment, with deployment anticipated during Q3 2025.\nThe Company continues to benefit from a strong reputation for specialist engineering and successful delivery in technically challenging environments. The Company expects its financial results for the year ended 30 June 2025 to be in line with market expectations and, whilst the macroeconomic environment remains challenging, opportunities for Plexus are encouraging and the Company remains confident in its strategy for sustainable growth.\nPlexus CEO Craig Hendrie said:\n\"We are pleased with the continued operational and commercial progress made during the year. The successful fundraising in March has enabled us to accelerate the expansion of our Exact\u2122 EX rental fleet and position Plexus to meet growing global demand. The Middle East and North America are becoming increasingly important markets for us, and our ability to deliver high-specification equipment into challenging environments continues to differentiate Plexus from our competitors.
