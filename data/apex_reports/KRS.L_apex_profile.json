Colton Hale was appointed Managing Director (\"MD\") of FIR in March 2025 and has overseen some significant operational changes in the US operation including what we believe is FIR's entry into the ever-growing liquids market.\nIn addition to the positive trends in the US, and as outlined in the Financial review below, the Company has now received its first payments in terms of the Cooperation Agreement it signed in 2023 with the Republic of Togo (\"State\")(\"Cooperation Agreement\") with regards the Nay\u00e9ga manganese mine (\"Nay\u00e9ga\") in northern Togo owned by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Togolaise de Mangan\u00e8se (STM), the States 100% owned investment company. The manganese market has rebounded strongly off its lows over the past 18 months Nay\u00e9ga is starting to produce in line with guidelines from STM.\nFalcon Isle Resources\nKeras, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Falcon Isle Resources Corp (\"FIR\"), owns the\u00a0Diamond Creek\u00a0organic rock phosphate mine (\"Diamond Creek\") located approximately 80km south-east of\u00a0Salt Lake City\u00a0and the Delta Facility both in\u00a0Utah, USA.\u00a0Diamond Creek, located on an 840-acre Federal Lease\u00a0is one of the highest-grade phosphate deposits in the US and is a fully integrated mine to market operation with in-house mining and processing facilities.\nFIR's dry, sized rock phosphate products, sold under the PhosAgri organic banner have received organic certification by all three key certification agencies in the\u00a0USA\u00a0-\u00a0California\u00a0(\"CDFA\"),\u00a0Washington State (\"WSDA\") and the federal Organic Materials Review Institute (\"OMRI\"). As a Direct Shipping Ore it requires no chemical or synthetic upgrade processes, contains low heavy metal impurities, available P2O5 of between 11%-15% which is 3x higher than any other organic phosphate produced\u00a0North America, and a calcium content of >25%.\nIn addition to producing PhosAgri, FIR owns 50% of the PhoSul Utah LLC joint venture (\"JV\") with Phosul LLC which produces the PhoSul\u00ae granulate comprising 80% of FIR's high grade organic rock phosphate from its\u00a0Diamond Creek\u00a0mine. Phosul\u00ae is the 2024 Green Chemistry Challenge Award winner\u00a0for making phosphate fertilizer that avoids hazardous chemicals and waste emissions associated with traditional phosphate fertilizer production, such as strong acids, heavy metals, and radioactive materials.\nOperations at the Delta Facility are progressing well where we are producing both Phosul\u00ae granulate and Falcon Isle's dry rock phosphate products, sold under the PhosAgri Organic banner. Sales of PhosAgri Organic for the period totalled 3,934 tons, an increase of 21% from the 3,238 tons sold in the previous 2024 period.\nPhoSul\u00ae granulate sales were disappointing but were more due to upgrades and optimisations to the plant at important times in the planting season rather than the demand for the product which has been robust and continues to grow.\nThe Company is\u00a0focused on continuing to build market share through its traditional milled dry rock products as well as its joint venture with Phosul LLC in the fast-growing US organic fertiliser market and build\u00a0Falcon Isle Resources\u00a0into the premier organic phosphate producer in the US.\nFinancial review\nThe results for the 6 months ended 30 June 2025 show a loss of \u00a3299,000 compared to loss of \u00a3436,000 in the six-month period ended 30 June 2024. The reduced loss was largely due to an overall reduction in operating and administrative costs in the group compared to the previous period. The previous period included the start of the transition to Delta which saw the dismantling of the Spanish Fork site and the start of construction at the Delta Facility.\nAlthough revenue was lower at \u00a3415,000 for the period compared to the \u00a3556,000 in the six month period ended 30 June 2024, the second half of the year has been significantly stronger with revenue to the end of September 2025 already outstripping the total for the six months ended 31 December 2024.\nOn 25 June 2025, the Company issued convertible loan notes (\"CLNs\") totalling \u00a3750,000, each for \u00a3375,000, to Christopher Grosso and Joseph Carbone. The proceeds of the CLNs were primarily used to pay the final tranche of $800,000 payable to the Helda Living Trust in respect of the acquisition of minority interests in Falcon Isle Resources Corp., which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and for working capital. On the 21 July 2025, the Company launched an open offer to qualifying shareholders at a price of\u00a01.4 pence\u00a0per open offer share, pro rata to their holdings of existing shares at 6.00pm on 18 July 2025 (\"Record date\") (\"Qualifying Shareholders\") on the basis of 542 offer shares for every 1,000 existing shares held by Qualifying Shareholders at the Record Date (\"Open Offer\"). The rationale for the CLN's and subsequent Open Offer were to ensure that the Company was able to meet the deadline for the payment to the Helda Living Trust while still providing an opportunity for all Qualifying Shareholders to participate in the fundraising by both subscribing for their respective Basic Entitlements and by subscribing for Excess Shares under the Excess Application Facility in the Open Offer. The Company received valid acceptances from Qualifying Shareholders for a total of 10,770,173 Offer Shares, representing a take-up of approximately 28.22 per cent. of the 38,163,608 Offer Shares available, raising approximately \u00a3150,782 (before expenses) at the issue price of 1.4 pence per Offer Share. The funds raised under the Open Offer were used to repay the part of the CLNs which were not converted.\nNay\u00e9ga starting mining activities at the end of July 2025 and is meeting expectations of processing ore at an initial rate of 4,000 tonnes per month of saleable manganese for the first 3 months and thereafter at nameplate capacity of 8,000 tonnes per month of saleable ore. The Company has now received its first payment as per the cooperation agreement signed in 2023 post the shipment of the initial 2,700 tonnes of ore in containers on 5 September 2025.\nThe progress at Nay\u00e9ga is very positive for Keras from an additional cashflow perspective and will underpin cashflows from the Company's flagship operation in Utah, USA. The Company continues to keep in close contact with the Togo Ministry of Mines in its advisory role with the State and we look forward to updating shareholders on progress in the near future.\nOutlook\nI believe that the transition to a 100% locally based management team in Utah and the bedding down of both the Phosul Utah JV and the Delta facility places the Company in a very robust position to cement its position as the preeminent organic rock phosphate producer in North America. The high grade PhosAgri Organic rock phosphate and the JV's Phosul\u00ae granulates are both significantly higher quality products compared to their peers and I believe that the significant inroads into their respective markets over the past 18 months will show dividends in the near term. This sector is underpinned by the macro-economic tailwinds of the global fertiliser markets, and we remain bullish on our premium phosphate products and our position as we continue to build market share.\nThe Company now has two sources of revenue, a slimmed down operations team and is poised for a strong finish to 2025. The Directors are confident that Falcon Isle will be an increasingly profitable and valuable asset for the Group, and we look forward to updating our shareholders on our progress as we continue to ramp up production and build our position and market share of the fast-growing US organic phosphate market.\nI would like to thank my colleagues on the board and our shareholders for their ongoing support and I look forward updating all stakeholders as we continue to build Keras and Diamond Creek into the premier organic phosphate producer in the US.\nRussell Lamming\nChairman\n29 September

Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nIn preparing this condensed consolidated interim financial report, significant judgements made by Management in applying the Group's accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those that applied to the audited consolidated financial statements as at and for the period ended 31 December 2024.\n3.

All Qualifying Shareholders who have validly applied for Offer Shares will therefore receive the number of Offer Shares for which they have applied, up to their Basic Entitlement. Applications for Offer Shares from Qualifying Shareholders under the Excess Application Facility will also be satisfied in full.\nAccordingly, subject to Admission being effective, 10,770,173 Offer Shares will be issued in connection with the Open Offer, raising approximately \u00a3150,782 (before expenses) at the issue price of 1.4 pence per Offer Share.\nThe funds raised under the Open Offer will be used to repay the part of the CLNs which is not converted.\nThe balance of the CLNs will be converted at the Offer Price, resulting in the issue of a total of\n42,801,256\nOrdinary Shares to Christopher Grosso (through the Diane H. Grosso Credit Shelter Trust, an associate of Mr. Grosso), and Joseph Carbone as follows:\nShareholder\nNumber of Existing Shares held\nNew\nTotal\nResultant holding (%)\nChristopher Grosso\n21,153,350\n21,400,628\n42,553,978\n27.89%\nJoseph Carbone\n7,450,000\n21,400,628\n28,850,628\n18.91%\nConcert Party total\n28,603,350\n42,801,256\n71,404,606\n46.80%\nDirector participation in the Open Offer\nThe following Director of the Company has participated in the Open Offer, as follows:\nDirector\nNumber of Existing Ordinary Shares held\nNumber of Offer Shares to be issued\nNumber of Ordinary Shares held on Admission\n% of the Enlarged Share Capital on Admission\nBrian Moritz\n2\n,649,204\n5\n00,000\n3,149,204\n2.06%\nRelated Party Transactions\nBrian Moritz is considered to be a Related Party of the Company as defined under the AIM Rules, and therefore his participation in the Open Offer is deemed to constitute a Related Party Transaction pursuant to AIM Rule 13 of the AIM Rules for Companies (the \"AIM Rules\").\nThe Diane H. Grosso Credit Shelter Trust (an associate of Christopher Grosso, a substantial shareholder in the Company as defined under the AIM Rules), is considered to be a Related Party of the Company and therefore the partial repayment and issue of Ordinary Shares pursuant to the CLN is deemed to be a Related Party Transaction in accordance with AIM Rule 13.\nThe Directors of the Company independent from the Director participation in the Open Offer, being Russell Lamming and Claire Parry and the Directors independent of the CLN, being Brian Moritz, Russell Lamming and Claire Parry, consider, having consulted with the Company's Nominated Adviser, SP Angel Corporate Finance LLP, that the proposed terms of the Director's participation in the Open Offer and the partial repayment and the issue of Ordinary Shares pursuant to the CLN are fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's Shareholders are concerned.\nApplication for Admission\nApplication has been made for the admission of the 10,770,173 Ordinary Shares issued pursuant to the Open Offer and 42,801,256 Ordinary Shares issued pursuant to the conversion of the CLN (total 53,571,429 Ordinary Shares (\"New Ordinary Shares\")) to trading on the AIM Market of the London Stock Exchange (\"Admission\"). It is anticipated that Admission will take place at 8 a.m. on or around 21 August 2025. The New Ordinary Shares will rank pari passu with the existing Ordinary Shares which are currently traded on AIM.\nTotal voting rights\nIn accordance with the FCA's Disclosure, Guidance and Transparency Rules, the Company confirms that following Admission of the Offer Shares and the shares issued pursuant to the conversion of the proportion of the CLNs not repaid from the proceeds of the Open Offer, the Company's enlarged issued ordinary share capital will compromise 152,587,340 Ordinary Shares. Therefore, from Admission, the total number of voting rights in the Company will be 152,587,340 and this figure may be used by shareholders in the Company as the denominator for the calculations to determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in the Company, under the Disclosure, Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nCapitalised terms used but not otherwise defined in this announcement bear the meanings ascribed to them in the Circular.\nResult of General Meeting\nKeras also announces that at the General Meeting held earlier today, all resolutions were approved by the requisite majorities. The Rule 9 Waiver Resolution (Resolution 2) was duly passed by a majority of the votes cast by Independent Shareholders only.\nThe proxy votes cast were as follows:\nResolution\nFor\nAgainst\nWithheld\nTotal\n1\n19,729,135\n898,218\n38,755\n20,666,108\n2\n19,654,011\n975,166\n36,931\n20,666,108\n3\n19,725,197\n799,087\n141,824\n20,666,108\nTotal Voting Rights\n99,015,911\nAs a result, the waiver of a potential obligation under Rule 9 of the Takeover Code for the Concert Party (comprising Christopher Grosso and Joseph Carbone) to make a mandatory general cash offer for the whole of the issued and to be issued share capital of the Company not already owned by the Concert Party, has been approved.\nFollowing conversion of the CLNs and Admission of both the Offer Shares and the shares issued pursuant to the CLNs, the members of the Concert Party will be interested in shares carrying more than 30% of the voting rights of the Company but will not hold shares carrying more than 50% of the voting rights of the Company.
