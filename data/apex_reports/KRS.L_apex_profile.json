Colton Hale was appointed Managing Director (\"MD\") of FIR in March 2025 and has overseen some significant operational changes in the US operation including what we believe is FIR's entry into the ever-growing liquids market.\nIn addition to the positive trends in the US, and as outlined in the Financial review below, the Company has now received its first payments in terms of the Cooperation Agreement it signed in 2023 with the Republic of Togo (\"State\")(\"Cooperation Agreement\") with regards the Nay\u00e9ga manganese mine (\"Nay\u00e9ga\") in northern Togo owned by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Togolaise de Mangan\u00e8se (STM), the States 100% owned investment company. The manganese market has rebounded strongly off its lows over the past 18 months Nay\u00e9ga is starting to produce in line with guidelines from STM.\nFalcon Isle Resources\nKeras, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Falcon Isle Resources Corp (\"FIR\"), owns the\u00a0Diamond Creek\u00a0organic rock phosphate mine (\"Diamond Creek\") located approximately 80km south-east of\u00a0Salt Lake City\u00a0and the Delta Facility both in\u00a0Utah, USA.\u00a0Diamond Creek, located on an 840-acre Federal Lease\u00a0is one of the highest-grade phosphate deposits in the US and is a fully integrated mine to market operation with in-house mining and processing facilities.\nFIR's dry, sized rock phosphate products, sold under the PhosAgri organic banner have received organic certification by all three key certification agencies in the\u00a0USA\u00a0-\u00a0California\u00a0(\"CDFA\"),\u00a0Washington State (\"WSDA\") and the federal Organic Materials Review Institute (\"OMRI\"). As a Direct Shipping Ore it requires no chemical or synthetic upgrade processes, contains low heavy metal impurities, available P2O5 of between 11%-15% which is 3x higher than any other organic phosphate produced\u00a0North America, and a calcium content of >25%.\nIn addition to producing PhosAgri, FIR owns 50% of the PhoSul Utah LLC joint venture (\"JV\") with Phosul LLC which produces the PhoSul\u00ae granulate comprising 80% of FIR's high grade organic rock phosphate from its\u00a0Diamond Creek\u00a0mine. Phosul\u00ae is the 2024 Green Chemistry Challenge Award winner\u00a0for making phosphate fertilizer that avoids hazardous chemicals and waste emissions associated with traditional phosphate fertilizer production, such as strong acids, heavy metals, and radioactive materials.\nOperations at the Delta Facility are progressing well where we are producing both Phosul\u00ae granulate and Falcon Isle's dry rock phosphate products, sold under the PhosAgri Organic banner. Sales of PhosAgri Organic for the period totalled 3,934 tons, an increase of 21% from the 3,238 tons sold in the previous 2024 period.\nPhoSul\u00ae granulate sales were disappointing but were more due to upgrades and optimisations to the plant at important times in the planting season rather than the demand for the product which has been robust and continues to grow.\nThe Company is\u00a0focused on continuing to build market share through its traditional milled dry rock products as well as its joint venture with Phosul LLC in the fast-growing US organic fertiliser market and build\u00a0Falcon Isle Resources\u00a0into the premier organic phosphate producer in the US.\nFinancial review\nThe results for the 6 months ended 30 June 2025 show a loss of \u00a3299,000 compared to loss of \u00a3436,000 in the six-month period ended 30 June 2024. The reduced loss was largely due to an overall reduction in operating and administrative costs in the group compared to the previous period. The previous period included the start of the transition to Delta which saw the dismantling of the Spanish Fork site and the start of construction at the Delta Facility.\nAlthough revenue was lower at \u00a3415,000 for the period compared to the \u00a3556,000 in the six month period ended 30 June 2024, the second half of the year has been significantly stronger with revenue to the end of September 2025 already outstripping the total for the six months ended 31 December 2024.\nOn 25 June 2025, the Company issued convertible loan notes (\"CLNs\") totalling \u00a3750,000, each for \u00a3375,000, to Christopher Grosso and Joseph Carbone. The proceeds of the CLNs were primarily used to pay the final tranche of $800,000 payable to the Helda Living Trust in respect of the acquisition of minority interests in Falcon Isle Resources Corp., which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and for working capital. On the 21 July 2025, the Company launched an open offer to qualifying shareholders at a price of\u00a01.4 pence\u00a0per open offer share, pro rata to their holdings of existing shares at 6.00pm on 18 July 2025 (\"Record date\") (\"Qualifying Shareholders\") on the basis of 542 offer shares for every 1,000 existing shares held by Qualifying Shareholders at the Record Date (\"Open Offer\"). The rationale for the CLN's and subsequent Open Offer were to ensure that the Company was able to meet the deadline for the payment to the Helda Living Trust while still providing an opportunity for all Qualifying Shareholders to participate in the fundraising by both subscribing for their respective Basic Entitlements and by subscribing for Excess Shares under the Excess Application Facility in the Open Offer. The Company received valid acceptances from Qualifying Shareholders for a total of 10,770,173 Offer Shares, representing a take-up of approximately 28.22 per cent. of the 38,163,608 Offer Shares available, raising approximately \u00a3150,782 (before expenses) at the issue price of 1.4 pence per Offer Share. The funds raised under the Open Offer were used to repay the part of the CLNs which were not converted.\nNay\u00e9ga starting mining activities at the end of July 2025 and is meeting expectations of processing ore at an initial rate of 4,000 tonnes per month of saleable manganese for the first 3 months and thereafter at nameplate capacity of 8,000 tonnes per month of saleable ore. The Company has now received its first payment as per the cooperation agreement signed in 2023 post the shipment of the initial 2,700 tonnes of ore in containers on 5 September 2025.\nThe progress at Nay\u00e9ga is very positive for Keras from an additional cashflow perspective and will underpin cashflows from the Company's flagship operation in Utah, USA. The Company continues to keep in close contact with the Togo Ministry of Mines in its advisory role with the State and we look forward to updating shareholders on progress in the near future.\nOutlook\nI believe that the transition to a 100% locally based management team in Utah and the bedding down of both the Phosul Utah JV and the Delta facility places the Company in a very robust position to cement its position as the preeminent organic rock phosphate producer in North America. The high grade PhosAgri Organic rock phosphate and the JV's Phosul\u00ae granulates are both significantly higher quality products compared to their peers and I believe that the significant inroads into their respective markets over the past 18 months will show dividends in the near term. This sector is underpinned by the macro-economic tailwinds of the global fertiliser markets, and we remain bullish on our premium phosphate products and our position as we continue to build market share.\nThe Company now has two sources of revenue, a slimmed down operations team and is poised for a strong finish to 2025. The Directors are confident that Falcon Isle will be an increasingly profitable and valuable asset for the Group, and we look forward to updating our shareholders on our progress as we continue to ramp up production and build our position and market share of the fast-growing US organic phosphate market.\nI would like to thank my colleagues on the board and our shareholders for their ongoing support and I look forward updating all stakeholders as we continue to build Keras and Diamond Creek into the premier organic phosphate producer in the US.\nRussell Lamming\nChairman\n29 September

All Qualifying Shareholders who have validly applied for Offer Shares will therefore receive the number of Offer Shares for which they have applied, up to their Basic Entitlement. Applications for Offer Shares from Qualifying Shareholders under the Excess Application Facility will also be satisfied in full.\nAccordingly, subject to Admission being effective, 10,770,173 Offer Shares will be issued in connection with the Open Offer, raising approximately \u00a3150,782 (before expenses) at the issue price of 1.4 pence per Offer Share.\nThe funds raised under the Open Offer will be used to repay the part of the CLNs which is not converted.\nThe balance of the CLNs will be converted at the Offer Price, resulting in the issue of a total of\n42,801,256\nOrdinary Shares to Christopher Grosso (through the Diane H. Grosso Credit Shelter Trust, an associate of Mr. Grosso), and Joseph Carbone as follows:\nShareholder\nNumber of Existing Shares held\nNew\nTotal\nResultant holding (%)\nChristopher Grosso\n21,153,350\n21,400,628\n42,553,978\n27.89%\nJoseph Carbone\n7,450,000\n21,400,628\n28,850,628\n18.91%\nConcert Party total\n28,603,350\n42,801,256\n71,404,606\n46.80%\nDirector participation in the Open Offer\nThe following Director of the Company has participated in the Open Offer, as follows:\nDirector\nNumber of Existing Ordinary Shares held\nNumber of Offer Shares to be issued\nNumber of Ordinary Shares held on Admission\n% of the Enlarged Share Capital on Admission\nBrian Moritz\n2\n,649,204\n5\n00,000\n3,149,204\n2.06%\nRelated Party Transactions\nBrian Moritz is considered to be a Related Party of the Company as defined under the AIM Rules, and therefore his participation in the Open Offer is deemed to constitute a Related Party Transaction pursuant to AIM Rule 13 of the AIM Rules for Companies (the \"AIM Rules\").\nThe Diane H. Grosso Credit Shelter Trust (an associate of Christopher Grosso, a substantial shareholder in the Company as defined under the AIM Rules), is considered to be a Related Party of the Company and therefore the partial repayment and issue of Ordinary Shares pursuant to the CLN is deemed to be a Related Party Transaction in accordance with AIM Rule 13.\nThe Directors of the Company independent from the Director participation in the Open Offer, being Russell Lamming and Claire Parry and the Directors independent of the CLN, being Brian Moritz, Russell Lamming and Claire Parry, consider, having consulted with the Company's Nominated Adviser, SP Angel Corporate Finance LLP, that the proposed terms of the Director's participation in the Open Offer and the partial repayment and the issue of Ordinary Shares pursuant to the CLN are fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's Shareholders are concerned.\nApplication for Admission\nApplication has been made for the admission of the 10,770,173 Ordinary Shares issued pursuant to the Open Offer and 42,801,256 Ordinary Shares issued pursuant to the conversion of the CLN (total 53,571,429 Ordinary Shares (\"New Ordinary Shares\")) to trading on the AIM Market of the London Stock Exchange (\"Admission\"). It is anticipated that Admission will take place at 8 a.m. on or around 21 August 2025. The New Ordinary Shares will rank pari passu with the existing Ordinary Shares which are currently traded on AIM.\nTotal voting rights\nIn accordance with the FCA's Disclosure, Guidance and Transparency Rules, the Company confirms that following Admission of the Offer Shares and the shares issued pursuant to the conversion of the proportion of the CLNs not repaid from the proceeds of the Open Offer, the Company's enlarged issued ordinary share capital will compromise 152,587,340 Ordinary Shares. Therefore, from Admission, the total number of voting rights in the Company will be 152,587,340 and this figure may be used by shareholders in the Company as the denominator for the calculations to determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in the Company, under the Disclosure, Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nCapitalised terms used but not otherwise defined in this announcement bear the meanings ascribed to them in the Circular.\nResult of General Meeting\nKeras also announces that at the General Meeting held earlier today, all resolutions were approved by the requisite majorities. The Rule 9 Waiver Resolution (Resolution 2) was duly passed by a majority of the votes cast by Independent Shareholders only.\nThe proxy votes cast were as follows:\nResolution\nFor\nAgainst\nWithheld\nTotal\n1\n19,729,135\n898,218\n38,755\n20,666,108\n2\n19,654,011\n975,166\n36,931\n20,666,108\n3\n19,725,197\n799,087\n141,824\n20,666,108\nTotal Voting Rights\n99,015,911\nAs a result, the waiver of a potential obligation under Rule 9 of the Takeover Code for the Concert Party (comprising Christopher Grosso and Joseph Carbone) to make a mandatory general cash offer for the whole of the issued and to be issued share capital of the Company not already owned by the Concert Party, has been approved.\nFollowing conversion of the CLNs and Admission of both the Offer Shares and the shares issued pursuant to the CLNs, the members of the Concert Party will be interested in shares carrying more than 30% of the voting rights of the Company but will not hold shares carrying more than 50% of the voting rights of the Company. For so long as they continue to be acting in concert, any increase in their aggregate interest in shares will be subject to the provisions of Rule 9.\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 (as amended) as it forms part of the domestic law of the\nUnited Kingdom\nby virtue of the\nEuropean Union\n(Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended).

Colton and his US team have made significant progress since joining the Company earlier this year and our high-grade phosphate products are extremely well positioned for both the organic and conventional fertiliser markets and it is time to deliver into both of those markets. The cash flow from Nay\u00e9ya will underpin the US cash flows and we look forward to being cash flow positive from a group perspective in due course. I look forward to updating shareholders in the near term on progress on both fronts.\n\"\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 (as amended) as it forms part of the domestic law of the\nUnited Kingdom\nby virtue of the\nEuropean Union\n(Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended).

Capitalised terms used but not otherwise defined in this announcement bear the meanings ascribed to them in the Circular.\nYour attention is drawn to the risk factors set out in Part 5 of the Circular. Details of the action to be taken if you wish to subscribe for Open Offer Shares are provided in Part 3 of the Circular.\nRule 9 Waiver\nAs Keras cannot be certain that Shareholders will take up the Open Offer (either in full or in part) and the Company is unable to make the Open Offer to any US based Shareholders due to restrictions under US securities law, on 25 June 2025 two of the Company's US-based significant Shareholders (Christopher (\"Chris\") Grosso, through the Diane H. Grosso Credit Shelter Trust, an associate of Mr. Grosso, and Joseph Carbone) subscribed for CLNs to the value of \u00a3750,000 as an interim funding solution pending the completion of the Open Offer process. The Company has agreed with the Panel that Chris Grosso and Joseph Carbone are acting in concert in relation to the Company.\nAs the conversion of the CLNs, may result in the Concert Party (in aggregate), or the individual members of the Concert Party, holding over 30 per cent. of the voting rights of the Company, but less than 50 per cent., or over 50 per cent. of the voting rights, (depending on the level of subscription under the Open Offer) the exercise of the CLNs would normally trigger an obligation for an offer to be made under Rule 9 of the Takeover Code. However, the Panel has agreed to waive this obligation such that there will be no requirement for an offer to be made in respect of the exercise of the CLNs, subject to approval (on a poll) of the Independent Shareholders of the Rule 9 Waiver Resolution. The Rule 9 Waiver will be sought in respect of the Concert Party increasing its holding from, in aggregate, 28.89 per cent. of the Company's issued Ordinary Share capital to up to a maximum of 53.85 per cent. (in aggregate).\nThe Company has therefore called a General Meeting in order,\ninter alia,\nto put to the Independent Shareholders the Rule 9 Waiver Resolution. If the Rule 9 Waiver Resolution is not approved, the CLNs will not be capable of conversion in full.\nPosting of Circular\nThe Company has today posted a Circular to Shareholders, which will be\nshortly be available from the Company's website at\nwww.kerasplc.com\n(\nextracts of which are set out below),\ncontaining detailed information about the Open Offer, including the terms and conditions and details on how to accept the Open Offer (the \"Circular\") and an accompanying Application Form (where applicable).\nThe Circular will explain the background to the issue of the CLNs and the launch of the Open Offer, to provide Independent Shareholders with details of ",

Crushed run-of-mine (\"ROM\") ore was hauled to the Delta Facility prior to the onset of winter snowfall for milling to 10 mesh and 50 mesh for direct sales as well as feed for the Granulator Plant; and\n\u00b7\nThis was the first winter that all ROM was stored in a dry, under-roof environment which will significantly benefit the beneficiation process.\nCorporate\n\u00b7\nThe Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year shows a loss of\n\u00a3753,000 (2023 - loss \u00a3446,000);\n\u00b7\nIn January 2024 and May 2024, the Company r\nestructured its balance sheet with the issue of\nconvertible loans of \u00a3300,000\n(at a conversion price of \u00a30.04) and \u00a3597,805 (at a conversion price \u00a30.0275) and FIR issued Promissory Notes of $350,000 (at a 7% per annum interest rate) and \u00a3597,805 (at an 8% per annum interest rate);\n\u00b7\nPost period end, on 25 June 2025 the Company issued zero coupon convertible loan notes for \u00a3750,000; and\n\u00b7\nFunds were used to acquire the Delta facility and repay the remaining consideration for its acquisition of FIR and Falcon Isle Holdings LLC in March 2022, which 100% owns the Diamond Creek high grade phosphate mine (\"Diamond Creek\").\nRussell Lamming, Keras Resources Executive Chairman, commented,\n\"\n2024 marked the start of the Company's transition into a wholly owned, fully focussed North American business targeting the robust organic fertiliser market. The final payment for the acquisition of\nDiamond Creek is a significant milestone for the Company - this is the cornerstone asset of the Company which is considered to be the highest-grade rock phosphate project in\nNorth America.

The proceeds of the CLNs will be used primarily to pay the final tranche of $800,000 payable to the Helda Living Trust in respect of the acquisition of minority interests in Falcon Isle Resources Corp., which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and for working capital.\nThe CLNs will be convertible in whole or in part into Ordinary Shares of 1p each in the Company at 1.4p per share, subject to regulatory considerations and the consent of the Takeover Code to put a Rule 9 waiver resolution to Independent Shareholders, and will be repayable in part from the proceeds of a proposed Open Offer. The Company has agreed with the Panel that Mr. Grosso and Mr. Carbone are acting in concert in relation to the Company and Messrs. Grosso and Carbone currently hold 21.36% and 7.42% of the existing share capital of the Company respectively. Mr Grosso has subscribed for the CLN through\nt\nhe Diane H. Grosso Credit Shelter Trust\n, an associate of Mr. Grosso.\nAs the conversion of the CLNs could lead to Messrs. Grosso and Carbone holding, in aggregate, over 30%, but less than 50% of the issued share capital of the Company, any conversion of the CLNs would be subject to obtaining Takeover Panel consent to a waiver of the requirement for Messrs. Grosso and Carbone to make a general offer under Rule 9 of the Takeover Code and the passing of a Rule 9 waiver resolution by a poll of independent shareholders.\nThe CLNs will initially be interest free, but, should the resolution in respect of the Rule 9 waiver referred to below prevent conversion of the CLNs, interest on the debt will be payable at 20% per annum and security may be required by the holders of the CLNs. Under those circumstances, the CLNs will be repayable after 30 days' notice to be given by either party at any time after 30 June 2026.\nSubject to receipt of Takeover Panel approval for the Rule 9 waiver, the Company intends to call a General Meeting to put to the independent shareholders a Rule 9 waiver resolution, which, if passed, would enable Messrs. Grosso and Carbone to convert the CLNs.\nOpen Offer\nSubsequent to the issue of the CLNs, the Company is proposing to launch an open offer to qualifying shareholders at a price of 1.4 pence per open offer share, pro rata to their holdings of existing shares on the record date (to be advised) on the basis of 542 offer shares for every 1,000 existing shares (the \"Open Offer\").\nThe funds raised under the Open Offer will be used to repay the part of the CLNs which is not converted.\nThe Directors have given consideration as to the best way to structure a proposed equity fundraising, taking into account current market conditions, the composition of the shareholder register and the Board's desire to give shareholders the opportunity to avoid dilution where practicable and have concluded that the issue of the CLNs and the Open Offer is the most suitable option available to the Company and its shareholders as a whole. The Open Offer will provide an opportunity for all qualifying shareholders to participate in the fundraising by acquiring Offer Shares pro rata to their current holdings of existing shares.\nFurther details will be provided to shareholders in regard to both the Rule 9 waiver and the Open Offer in due course.\nRelated Party Transaction\nThe\nDiane H. Grosso Credit Shelter Trust\n(an associate of Christopher Grosso, a substantial shareholder in the Company as defined under the AIM Rules for Companies (the \"AIM Rules\")), is considered to be a Related Party of the Company, and the provision of the CLN set out above is therefore deemed to be a Related Party Transaction pursuant to AIM Rule 13 of the AIM Rules for Companies.\nThe Directors of the Company independent of the issue of the CLN, being Brian Moritz, Russell Lamming and Claire Parry, consider, having consulted with the Company's Nominated Adviser, SP Angel Corporate Finance LLP, that the proposed terms of the Convertible Loan are fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned.\nRussell Lamming, Executive Chairman of Keras, commented\n, \"The funding solution today is the final payment for the acquisition of the Diamond Creek Mine - this is the cornerstone asset of the Company which is considered to be the highest grade rock phosphate project in North America.

Colton studied part-time for his Bachelor's degree while working for Burningham Enterprises as an equipment operator from 2014-18 and then as a mining supervisor from 2020-22 (this included the construction of the access roads and maiden mining campaign at Diamond Creek). Subsequently Colton was a Project Superintendent at Bodell Construction and Senior Financial Analyst at Rio Tinto.\n\u00b7\nOperations at the Delta Facility are progressing well where we are producing both Phosul\u00ae granulate under the Phosul Utah LLC joint venture (\"JV\") as announced on 22 January 2024 and Falcon Isle's dry rock phosphate products, sold under the PhosAgri Organic banner.\n\u00b7\nPhosAgri Organic, Falcon Isles primary rock phosphate product has available P\n2\nO\n5\nof between 11%-15% which is 3x higher than any other organic phosphate produced in the United States and is certified organic by the three key agencies namely;\n\u00b7\nCDFA - California Department of Food & Agriculture\n\u00b7\nOMRI - Organic Materials Review Institute\n\u00b7\nWSDA - Washington State Department of Agriculture\n\u00b7\nSales of PhosAgri Organic for 2024 totalled 5,297 tons, an increase of 15% from the 4,606 tons sold in 2023.\n\u00b7\nPhosul\u00ae is the 2024 Green Chemistry Challenge Award winner\u00a0for making phosphate fertilizer that avoids hazardous chemicals and waste emissions associated with traditional phosphate fertilizer production, such as strong acids, heavy metals, and radioactive materials. Sales of Phosul\u00ae from the JV only materially started in January of this year when the demand for Spring planting began. The JV saw a significant increase in demand in the first quarter of 2025 and we expect this to continue through the year.\nRussell Lamming, Interim Executive Chairman of Keras, commented,\n\"I have just returned from the US where I spent time at our operation in Delta, at our Phosul JV partners' operations in Idaho and with customers and potential partners. Our US based high-grade phosphate products are extremely well positioned for both the organic and conventional fertiliser markets and it is time to deliver into both of those markets. Securing Colton, who is both a hands-on operator and a financial MD, is very important to our strategy and I would like to welcome him to the team and look forward to growing the Falcon Isle brand with him leading the US team. I look forward to updating shareholders in the near term on progress on both fronts.\n\"\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 (as amended) as it forms part of the domestic law of the\nUnited Kingdom\nby virtue of the\nEuropean Union\n(Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended).

We remain bullish about this growing market segment and a portion of the funds raised will go towards bolstering our team with sales personnel, which in the organic space requires very specific knowledge and relationships.\"\nRelated Party Transaction\nThe Subscription by Christopher Grosso, a substantial shareholder in the Company, constitutes a related party transaction pursuant to AIM Rule 13 of the AIM Rules for Companies.\u00a0The Board, all of whom are considered Directors independent of the Subscription, consider, having consulted with the Company's Nominated Adviser, that the Subscription\u00a0is fair and reasonable insofar as the shareholders of the Company are concerned.\nFollowing the Subscription, Christopher Grosso will have a beneficial interest in 21,153,350 Ordinary Shares of the Company, representing approximately 22.17 per cent. of the enlarged share capital of the Company.\nFollowing the Subscription, Joseph Carbone will have a beneficial interest in 7,450,000 Ordinary Shares of the Company, representing approximately 7.81 per cent. of the enlarged share capital of the Company.\nDetails of the Subscription\nThe Subscription has been conducted utilising the Directors' existing authorities to issue new Ordinary Shares. Application has been made for admission of the 14,900,000 Subscription Shares to trading on the AIM Market of the\u00a0London Stock Exchange\u00a0('Admission'). It is anticipated that Admission will take place at\u00a08 a.m. on or around 1 November 2024. The Subscription Shares will rank\npari passu\nwith the existing Ordinary Shares, which are currently traded on AIM.\nFollowing Admission, there will be 95,397,177 Ordinary Shares in issue with each share carrying the right to one vote. There are no shares currently held in treasury. The total number of voting rights in the Company will therefore be 95,397,177 and this figure may be used by shareholders as the denominator for the calculations by which they determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the Company under the Financial Conduct Authority's Disclosure Rules and Transparency Rules.\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 (as amended) as it forms part of the domestic law of the\nUnited Kingdom\nby virtue of the\nEuropean Union\n(Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended).

The first half of 2024 has been transformative for the Company with the conclusion of the PhoSul Utah LLC joint venture (\"Phosul JV\"), the acquisition of the property in Sutherland, 8 miles north of the town of Delta, Utah (\"Delta Facility\") on 22 January 2024 and the transfer of all our processing infrastructure from Spanish Fork to Delta.\nThe move to Delta has resulted in the Company running the business from a stand alone, wholly owned property which has the under roof space to house the newly constructed Integrated Granulator Plant (\"Granulator Plant\") and all ancillary equipment, feed material and processed product. Prior to this move the Company rented property in Spanish Fork which was subject to urban encroachment and limited processing to day time operations. The Delta Facility does not have such limitations and when at full production the Company will run a 24 hour, three shift operation.\nUnderpinning the move to Delta, the Phosul JV agreement comprises a five year 50:50 joint venture between the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Falcon Isle Resources Corp (\"FIR\") and PhoSul LLC (\"PhoSul\"), a specialised organic soil enhancement fertilizer company with granulator operations in Idaho, United States (\"US\"). PhoSul and FIR have jointly funded the construction and commissioning of the Granulator Plant, which will produce a PhoSul\u00ae granulate comprising 80% of FIR's high grade organic rock phosphate from its Diamond Creek mine. PhoSul\u00ae is currently being produced at the PhoSul LLC's processing facility in Sugar City, Idaho. Current demand for the product outweighs PhoSul's Idaho processing capacity so the JV's product will be delivering into an established market with significant scope for growth in the south western states. I firmly believe this transaction will prove to be one of the key inflection points in the Company's trajectory to becoming the premier, high grade, o",

The 2024 campaign plans for production of between 6,000 and 8,000 tons of which 3,000 tons to date has already been mined and hauled down to the laydown area at Diamond Creek. Crushed run-of-mine (\"ROM\") ore will progressively be hauled to the Delta Facility prior to the onset of winter snowfall for milling to 10 mesh and 50 mesh for direct sales as well as feed for the recently commissioned granulator plant to produce 240SGN PhoSul\u00ae with the Company's Phosul Utah LLC joint venture (\"JV\") partners. This will be the first winter that all ROM is stored in a dry, under-roof environment which will significantly benefit the beneficiation process.\nSince commissioning the Delta Facility, additional minor plant modifications have continued to improve both consistent overall production and product quality and is now running at full capacity allowing the JV to now market PhoSul\u00ae granulates into the autumn planting season.\nGraham Stacey, CEO of Keras commented\n, \"Ramping up of our Delta Facility to full capacity is the next milestone achieved by the team in Delta in what has been a transformative year to date. The new integrated circuit is far more efficient than the previous plant at Spanish fork and has allowed us to continue to produce and sell our dry 10 mesh and 50 mesh dry rock phosphate products as well as producing PhoSul\u00ae granulated fertilizer in collaboration with our JV partners PhoSul LLC. We believe the additional product diversification brought by marketing\nPhoSul\u00ae\n,a finished product for direct farm application rather than a blend constituent through third-party blending distributors will open new niche markets in the robust North American organic fertiliser sector.\n\"The continuation of mining at Diamond Creek during the 2024 summer season to generate ore for both in-house sales as well as feed to the PhoSul Utah JV has progressed well to date and will continue through to end-November which will set us up for beneficiation and sales in Delta during the winter season through to May 2025 when mining will recommence.\nThe Delta Facility has brought the business stability we've been looking for since acquiring 100% in Falcon Isle which we will continue to build on with both Falcon Isle products and PhoSul Utah JV granulate sales.\"\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 (as amended) as it forms part of the domestic law of the\nUnited Kingdom\nby virtue of the\nEuropean Union\n(Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended).

Several upgrades and optimisations were implemented progressing from hot commissioning to commercial production, with consistent production now having been achieved by the operational team from contractor Burningham Enterprises Group operating on a single shift basis to maintain and improve upon nameplate saleable product output of 5 tons per hour. The timely achievement of this milestone was made materially smoother with on-site input from the Company's joint venture (\"JV\") partners PhoSul LLC, which has saved Keras both time and cost.\nThe JV will spend the coming months operating on a single shift basis ironing out early production improvements, progressing to double shift operations during the fourth quarter of 2024 and progressively to continuous operations during the first quarter of 2025.\nPer previous announcements, PhoSul\u00ae's formulation has been specifically developed to improve Phosphorous (\"P2O5\") availability to crops, where results from field tests have demonstrated significant yield and quality improvements over competitor rock phosphate sources. With current traditional phosphate fertilizer production and use under increased environmental pressure, PhoSul\u00ae further helps to solve Phosphorous run-off and water resource contamination, a key component of the Company's organic identity.\nPreparations for the 2024 summer mining season have commenced, during which the Company plans to produce between 8,000 and 10,000 tons dictated by demand during the back end of summer and early fall. 100% owned Falcon Isle Resources (\"FIR\") will sell rock phosphate to the JV, building up to steady-state sales of approximately 10,500 tons per annum, in addition to internal sales of approximately 6,500 tons per annum.\nGraham Stacey, CEO of Keras, commented\n, \"It is naturally an exciting time for us to be building a PhoSul\u00ae stockpile at our Delta Facility\n. Organic granulation requires a very specific formula and the blending of the PhoSul\u00ae ingredients in the design ratio, supplemented with moisture, an organic binder and a dust control agent in the overall product blend has been a challenging process which we will continue to optimise with strong support from our PhoSul LLC JV colleagues. An important part of our transition to sales will include moisture and hardness testing as well as 240 size guide number (\"SGN\") analysis on an ongoing basis. Our intention is to produce 240SGN product in bulk in the short-to medium-term, with the option to produce 1 ton bags should demand dictate.\n\"The move to Delta has been a significant shift in our operating model, we look forward to settling into our new facility, optimising operations and growing our sales without the distractions we've experienced to date, and delivering profitability to our shareholders. We look forward to announcing our output and profitability forecasts during the coming weeks.\"\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 (as amended) as it forms part of the domestic law of the\nUnited Kingdom\nby virtue of the\nEuropean Union\n(Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended).

Hot commissioning tests each plant component under progressively increasing load conditions until design capacity is reached. The 5 ton per hour \"(tph\") nameplate capacity Granulator Plant circuit incorporates a high-pressure grinding rolls (\"HPGR\") mill to initially blend and then reduce feed ingredients to approximately 90mesh (160 micron), the design size fraction for optimal granulation. The downstream granulation circuit includes twin 9.5ft diameter pans with organic liquid binder application, dryer and cooler rotary kilns, dried granule rotary screen and final product radial stacker. The Granulator Plant will be powered using a 600kW diesel generator until 3-phase grid power can be installed which is anticipated within the first year of operation.\nAs part of the hot commissioning process, the Granulator Plant's liquid circuits - principally the addition of an organic binder and dust control agent, were commissioned and introduced into the milled high grade rock phosphate feed produced from the Company's wholly owned Diamond Creek mine to produce the first granules from the Granulator Plant.\nThe commencement of hot commissioning of the Granulator Plant is a significant milestone for FIR and the PhoSul Utah LLC JV and starts a new chapter for FIR producing a tested finished product for direct farm application. PhoSul\u00ae's formulation allows for improved Phosphorous availability in the soil, results from field tests have demonstrated significant yield and quality improvements over competitor rock phosphate sources. With current traditional phosphate fertilizer production and use under increased environmental pressure, PhoSul\u00ae further helps to solve Phosphorous run-off, a key component of the Company's organic identity.\nGraham Stacey, CEO of Keras, commented\n, \"Constant progress towards full load commissioning and refinement of an integrated circuit is always a challenging phase of plant construction and build-up to steady-state production. We're very pleased to have progressed to hot commissioning and production of first organic granules without any material flaws to-date which speaks to the commitment of the construction and commissioning team given the intricacies of the move from Spanish Fork and the integration of the HPGR and granulator circuits in an entirely different configuration.

In addition, the late and swift snow melt caused a landslide impacting the upper haul road to the mine which required an engineered repair and Forest Service approval prior to the commencement of the summer mining season.\n\"In a year of consolidation post the acquisition of the outstanding 49% in FIR during 2022 we continued to establish ourselves in the organic fertilizer space in the US increasing our sales 7.7% to 4,606t which, given the late winter and continued high inflationary operating environment impacting the buying patterns of farmers and distributors, we were not unhappy with FIR's performance for the year. An important step forward during the final quarter of the year was the negotiation of the PhoSul Utah LLC JV with Idaho based organic fertiliser specialist PhoSul LLC. Understanding the need to expand our product portfolio to include tested finished product and to bring our granulator plant into production. The decision to move our operations from Spanish Fork to Delta was equally important giving us longevity without the pressures of rapidly expanding residential developments. The rapid move from Spanish Fork and construction of the integrated granulator plant at our newly acquired property in Delta has also been particularly pleasing and we look forward to reporting on developments in Delta as we optimise the granulator plant and continue to grow sales of our own dry milled products.\"\nPosting of Annual Report\nCopies of the Company's full Annual Report and Financial Statements (the \"Annual Report\") will be made available to download from the Company's\nw\nebsite today\nat\nhttps://kerasplc.com/results-and-reports/\nand\u00a0will also be posted to shareholders who elected to receive a hard copy on 27 June 2024.\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 (as amended) as it forms part of the domestic law of the United Kingdom by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended).

C1 involves energisation of motors for directional checking, start-up sequencing, instrument set-up and confirmation that all installed items meet design requirements under no-load conditions without dry feed materials or binding and dust control liquids. With all equipment installed, C1 is a significant milestone for Keras's 100% owned Falcon Isle Resources Corp (\"Falcon Isle\").\nGiven the scale of what was required to transition from an outsourced production and ownership model operating from three rental facilities to the Company's wholly owned, fully integrated production facility at Delta in just four months, which was underpinned by the conclusion of the Phosul Utah LLC joint venture (\"JV\") as announced on 22 January 2024, has been an outstanding achievement by the project team as well as the Company's supportive funding partners.\nThe project team will now work towards wet commissioning under load conditions with granulator binder fluids (\"C2\") during the first half of June 2024 which will initially comprise test granulation of Falcon Isle's rock phosphate before introducing the additional constituents of the Phosul\u00ae final product. The Granulator Plant has a nameplate capacity of 5 tonnes per hour of finished product. At steady-state single shift operation, the Granulator Plant is planned to produce approximately 520 tons per month (\"tpm\"), working towards upgrading to double shift operations during the fourth quarter of 2024 to produce approximately 920tpm of saleable bulk Phosul\u00ae granules. The Phosul\u00ae formula comprises 80% of 50 mesh PhosAgri feed produced from ore mined at the Diamond Creek mine, Falcon Isle's wholly owned, high grade organic phosphate mine. Falcon Isle currently holds inventory of approximately 4,250tons of 50# PhosAgri product, sufficient to cover Granulator Plant operations for the rest of 2024 which, importantly, will have a positive impact on cashflow with all mining and crushing costs already expensed.\nGraham Stacey, CEO of Keras, commented\n, \"Having made the decision to migrate operations from Spanish Fork, acquiring the Delta Property and achieving C1 commissioning on schedule in the space of four months has been an outstanding achievement from both our project team but also with the support of our funding partners.\nAs we now move into C2 commissioning and build up to steady-state commercial production of Phosul\u00ae granules, the value add of the Phosul Utah LLC JV will underpin our traditional PhosAgri markets and significantly increase the footprint of our sales in North America. Having the Phosul LLC team as partners, who have five years of both producing and importantly marketing Phosul\u00ae from their Sugar City, Idaho facility is key to achieving our growth strategy and we look forward to working with their team going forward.\nAs always, I encourage shareholders and potential investors to view our social media posts to get a sense of the physical progress achieved in Delta to date. I look forward to updating shareholders on progress as we now move towards the final commissioning and ramp-up phase of the integrated Granulator Plant.\"\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 (as amended) as it forms part of the domestic law of the\nUnited Kingdom\nby virtue of the\nEuropean Union\n(Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended).

The additional funds will be used to pay US$800,000 consideration due to the vendor of Falcon Isle on 1 July 2024, US$100,000 for\na\nfinal\nseverance payment to the former CEO of Falcon Isle\n, and for growth projects and general working capital. The restructure ensures that the Company can meet its current obligations without negatively impacting the long-term growth profile at the high-grade organic phosphate business in Utah, USA.\nThe cash funding includes funding from\nt\nhe Diane H. Grosso Credit Shelter Trust\n, an associate of 17% shareholder Chris Grosso with Directors Russell Lamming and Graham Stacey capitalising US$100,000 (GBP78,401) of outstanding fees each due from the Company (50% in the form of Convertible Loans and 50% in the form of the Loans).\nFurther details of dealings by Russell Lamming and Graham Stacey are set out in the Appendix.\nThe funding comprises:-\n\u00b7\n4 year convertible loan notes totalling GBP 597,805 (US$762,500), at a 4% per annum interest rate and conversion price of GBP 0.0275 issued by Keras (\"Convertible Loans\"). After 12 months, if the 30 day volume weighted Keras share price is GBP 0.09 (British pounds sterling) or greater, Keras has the option to call the conversion of the Convertible Loans. The Convertible Loans are being made to Keras and may be converted at any time by notice given by the holders, interest will be compounded annually and included with the amount being converted, or paid at the end of the 4 year loan period if not converted; and\n\u00b7\n4 year Promissory Notes totalling US$762,500 (GBP597,805) at an 8% per annum interest rate repayable after 4 years. The Promissory Notes are being made to Falcon Isle Resource Corp which has the right to repay the loans, without penalty, after 2 years (the \"Loans\"). Interest on the loans is payable annually on the anniversary of the notes.\nThe Directors of the Company have the authority to issue shares for cash up to a maximum nominal value of \u00a3165,000. The total nominal value required for the restructuring, including interest is \u00a3254,308, therefore the funding will be completed in 2 tranches. Tranche 1, using existing authorities requires a nominal value of \u00a3156,801 and for Tranche 2 the Company will propose a resolution at the 2024 AGM, expected to be held at the end of July 2024 authorising the Directors to issue shares for cash up to a maximum nominal value of \u00a397,507 (which includes \u00a336,924 for interest accrued over the 4 year tenure).\nConvertible Loan\nShares\nNominal (GBP)\nTranche 1 (Principle)\n\u00a3431,203\n15,680,125\n\u00a3156,801\nTranche 2 (Principle)\n\u00a3166,601\n6,058,230\n\u00a360,582\nSub Total\n\u00a3597,805\n21,738,358\n\u00a3217,384\nTranche 2 (Interest)\n\u00a3101,542\n3,692,446\n\u00a336,924\nTotal\n\u00a3699,347\n25,430,802\n\u00a3254,308\nRelated Party Transaction\nRussell Lamming, Graham Stacey, and\nt\nhe Diane H.

The tender process closes on 7 June 2024 and requires the successful applicant to be fully mobilised within 6 months of the tender award. The State has already mobilised personnel at Nay\u00e9ga to ensure that the infrastructure, including water pipelines and access roads are in operational condition to ensure timeous re-establishment of operations at Nay\u00e9ga.\nThe timing of the Tender process is very advantageous with regards the manganese market which has rebounded recently from a prolonged low price environment and the Nay\u00e9ga mine, which is effectively production ready will be able to produce into this rebound in a short period of time.\nAs announced in 2023, Keras has advisory and brokerage agreements with the State where the Company will be paid\nan advisory fee of 1.5% of gross revenue generated from the Nay\u00e9ga mine for the provision of advisory services for 3 years and 6.0% of gross revenue generated from the Nay\u00e9ga mine for the provision of brokerage services for the lesser of 3.5 years or 900,000 tonnes of beneficiated manganese ore produced and sold from Nay\u00e9ga.\nGraham Stacey, CEO of Keras, commented,\n\"The mobilisation of key staff at Nay\u00e9ga and the issue of a request for tender for the management of the Nay\u00e9ga operation is a significant step forward in the development of this asset which the Company fully supports and is very much in line with the 2023 cooperation Agreement we have with STM and sets a clear picture of how the asset will now be developed to benefit all stakeholders including Keras. We look forward to working closely with the management team of STM.\nThe progress at Nay\u00e9ga is very positive for Keras from an additional cashflow perspective and will underpin what has been a hugely productive 6 months at the Company's flagship operation in Utah, USA where its subsidiary Falcon Isle Resources Corp, now operating from its 100% owned facility in Delta, is finalising the construction of a fully integrated granulator plant to produce\nPhosul\u00ae granules under the joint venture with partners, Phosul LLC.\nThe\nPhosul\u00ae\nproduction line will augment the already installed processing infrastructure producing sized dry rock phosphate products from the high-grade Diamond Creek phosphate mine.

As previously announced, the Company's 100% owned subsidiary, Falcon Isle Resources Corp (\"FIR\"), commenced construction of the integrated milling and granulator plant (\"Integrated Plant\") at its newly acquired property in Delta, Utah in February 2024. The Integrated Plant is the cornerstone of the joint venture (\"JV\") with Idaho based partner, Phosul LLC. Construction is on schedule with commissioning expected during the second half of May 2024 with production ramp-up through Q3 2024. When fully commissioned, the Integrated Plant will have nameplate Phosul\u00ae production capacity of 520 tons per month (\"tpm\") and 920tpm when operating on single shift and double shift respectively.\nThe Integrated Plant, comprising FIR's high pressure grinding rolls (\"HPGR\") mill transplanted from its original Spanish Fork site and a 5 ton per hour granulator plant received from a Chinese original equipment manufacturer (\"OEM\"), will initially operate on a single shift basis but will be scaled up to continuous operations by the end of the year. The Integrated Plant will produce Phosul\u00ae granules, the formulation of which has been through extensive field trials and will be marketed by Phosul LLC predominantly in the western states of the US. Importantly the Phosul\u00ae formula comprises 80% of FIR's rock phosphate produced its 100% owned Diamond Creek mine, equating to up to 760tpm at full production which will be sold by FIR to the JV and will materially increase sales of 50 mesh product for the balance of 2024 and the remainder of the initial five year JV term.\nFIR continues to produce organically certified 10 mesh and 50 mesh dry sized products with total sales for Q1 2024 of 1,969 tons, a 109% increase relative to the 941 tons sold during the same period in 2023 (Q1 2022: 829t), and demonstrates evidence of the increased traction that the Company's high grade certified products are attracting in the organic market. It's key to note that at full production, the JV is expected to increase FIR's quarterly sales of 50 mesh by approximately 2,280 tons per quarter (a further 115% increase on the Q1 2024 sales -i.e. traditional sales plus sales to the JV), with 100% of the revenue from the sales to the JV attributable to FIR while also sharing 50% in of the profit from the Phosul\u00ae product produced from this material.\nPhosul\u00ae is currently being produced at the Phosul LLC's processing facility in Sugar City, Idaho. Current demand for the product outweighs Phosul's Idaho processing capacity so the JV's product will be delivering into an established market with significant scope for growth in the south western states. With this envisaged growth, the Company is actively looking at new projects both in Utah and surrounding states to augment the 25,000 tons per year capacity from the Diamond Creek mine.\nGraham Stacey, CEO of Keras, commented\n, \"The acquisition of the Delta facility and the Phosul JV will be transformative for the Company. The site will not only house the processing equipment for all products, including the new Phosul\u00ae granulate, but also allows all run-of-mine crushed feed material and final products to be stored under cover. The associated reduction in moisture content reduces the cost of processing and provides a better quality product for our ever growing customer base. I cannot over-emphasise the importance of the Phosul JV, which at steady-state operation will consume approximately 10,500 tons per year of 50 mesh which compares to total sales of 2,111 tons in 2023, with the consequent effect on cash flow and profitability.\nThe Q1 2024 sales of our sized milled products, which doubled sales for the comparative reporting period in 2023, was very encouraging and will create a significant baseload on which to build with both the increase in 50 mesh product being sold to the JV and the attributable sales of Phosul\u00ae granulates. With commissioning of the Delta plant during May, the timing is perfect as we look forward to commencing our summer mining season.\nWe look forward to updating shareholders as we progress our journey to being the pre-eminent high-grade organic phosphate producer in north America.

The concrete pour for the civil footings for the granulator plant was completed on 19 February 2024,\nallowing for the mounting of the twin granulator pans, dryer and cooling rotary kilns to commence in the week starting 26\nFebruary 2024, on schedule and within budget.

Our JV partner, Phosul LLC, brings significant experience in the marketing, formulation and field demonstration of the Phosul\u00ae product, and construction of the integrated JV granulator plant at our Delta Facility is a very exciting time for Keras and our US subsidiary, Falcon Isle Resources. Constructing a new production facility on our own property is in a sense going back to our roots as a mining and mineral processing business, and having Phosul LLC as a partner, being experts in the agricultural and fertiliser fields, positions us perfectly for significant volume and profitability growth.

The JV includes the construction and commissioning, funded by Phosul, of FIR's 5tph granulator plant. The plant will produce a PhoSul\n\u00ae\ngranulate comprising 80% of FIR's high grade organic rock phosphate from its Diamond Creek mine. In addition, to facilitate the significant expansion in processing capacity, FIR has agreed to acquire an 8.4 acre property with 77,000 square feet of recently constructed undercover warehouse infrastructure for USD700,000. The property is located in the farming town of Sutherland, 8 miles north of the town of Delta, Utah (\"Delta Facility\") and approximately 80 miles south-west of our Spanish Fork operations. FIR will continue to produce its current dry phosphate products as well as the new PhoSul\n\u00ae\nJV granulates at the Delta Facility.\nJOINT VENTURE OVERVIEW\nFIR and Phosul LLC have enter into a 50:50 JV as follows;\n\u00b7\nAn initial term of 5 years, renewable at the end of the term;\n\u00b7\nPhosul will provide a zero interest bearing loan of USD270,000 to FIR for the construction and commissioning of the granulator plant:\no\nFIR remains the owner of the granulator plant;\no\nThe loan will only be repaid at the end of the initial 5 year JV term, or at the end of the JV if renewed;\n\u00b7\nAll operating expenses for the JV will be shared 50:50;\n\u00b7\nFIR will sell 50 mesh rock phosphate to the JV, estimated to be 11,000 tons per annum at steady state continuous operations, at its cost of production. This equates to approximately a 200% increase in FIR sales from total FY2023 sales of 4,606 tons; and\n\u00b7\nCommissioning of the granulator plant is expected towards the end of April 2024, with steady state planned for the second half of the year.\nPROPERTY ACQUISITION OVERVIEW\nThe Company believes the current operations centre in Spanish Fork will, over the next few years, come under increasing pressure from residential development - in terms of potential rezoning and pressure from newly developed adjacent residential neighbourhoods and has been assessing the option to move operating facilities for some time. The consummation of the JV was the catalyst for the move and provided the financial security required for both the acquisition and the funding thereof.\n\u00b7\nThe 8.4-acre Delta Facility is being acquired for a total consideration of USD700,000 from Western Ag Credit, a Utah-based agriculture financial institution;\n\u00b7\nThe property comprises 3 warehouse facilities constructed within the last 10 years. The total area under roof is 77,000 square feet which is significantly larger than the combined Spanish Fork warehouses (33,000 square feet) with the ability to more than double warehouse area if required;\n\u00b7\nKeeping product dry has been a key operational challenge to date, and the significant increase in undercover storage and operating area significantly limits that operational risk going forward;\n\u00b7\nThe property has existing water supply, access to a weighbridge with scale house and initial single-phase power, with 3-phase supply accessible 0.75miles from the property. The Company has initiated discussions with Rocky Mountain Power for the supply of overhead 3-phase power on the basis of our predicted ongoing power demand;\n\u00b7\nThe rural location, with Agricultural Industrial zoning and a Conditional Use Permit already approved, allows for 24 hour operation which significantly increases the effective operating capacities of all the Company's plant operations;\n\u00b7\nBurningham Enterprises Group, FIR's mining and logistics contractors, have mining and processing operations in the Delta area which facilitates significantly reduced back-haul trucking rates from the Diamond Creek mine to the new Delta headquarters. This largely mitigates the increased trucking distance from Diamond Creek to Delta compared to Spanish Fork, however Delta is considerably closer to our end markets in the Western US;\n\u00b7\nThe transition from Spanish Fork to Delta will begin immediately, and is expected to be completed around the end of April 2024.\nThe acquisition is being funded by loans from The Diane H. Grosso Credit Shelter Trust comprising:-\n\u00b7\na 4 year convertible loan note of GBP 300,000, at a 7% per annum interest rate and conversion price of GBP 0.04 issued by Keras (\"Convertible Loan\").

That said we believe we are in a strong position to now gear-up on the back of the marketing drive over the past year, which has resulted in significant interest and positive testwork from third party fertiliser blenders and producers. I think it is important to note that creating markets for our product, which in essence is convincing a farm to change its modus operandi, takes time but once that change is made that market has longevity. As mentioned in the Chairman's review we have had significant positive results in the testwork undertaken by third party organic fertiliser companies eager to use our rock phosphate in their blends and look forward to updating our shareholders in the near future about potential long-term offtakes or joint ventures. To that end, we will provide guidance towards the end of the fourth quarter for production and sales figures for 2024.\"\nThe information contained within this Announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 (as amended) as it forms part of the domestic law of the\nUnited Kingdom\nby virtue of the\nEuropean Union\n(Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended). Upon the publication of this Announcement via the\nRegulatory Information Service\n, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nGraham Stacey\nKeras Resources plc\ngraham@kerasplc.com\nEwan Leggat\u00a0/\u00a0Charlie Bouverat\nNominated Adviser & Joint Broker\nJoint Broker\nDamon Heath\u00a0/\u00a0Erik Woolgar\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP\nShard Capital Partners LLP\n+44 (0) 20 3470 0470\n+44 (0) 207 186 9900\nCHAIRMAN'S REVIEW\nFOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2023\nI am pleased to provide an update on our progress since the last report and to set out our outlook for the business going forward.\n2023 has been a transformative year for Keras with the unbundling of our investment interest in the Nay\u00e9ga manganese mine in northern Togo and the focus on becoming the pre-eminent high grade organic phosphate producer in North America.\nThe Diamond Creek phosphate mine\nThe Diamond Creek phosphate mine, which is believed to be one of the highest grade organic rock phosphate deposits in the US, comprises an opencast operation located on an 840 acre Federal Lease located approximately 80km south-east of Salt Lake City, Utah. Our focus going forward is to build the operation into the premier high-grade organic phosphate producer in the US.\nOur target market is the sustainable, organic agriculture sector and we are strong advocates for the benefits of enhancing soil health and reducing the impact that synthetic fertilisers have on water resources. Our organic phosphate fertilizer products help farmers realise better crop growth without sacrificing yields, and reduces the soil degradation seen when farmers use chemically manufactured fertilisers, while at the same time reducing the carbon footprint associated with growing their crops.\nSales for the first six months of 2023 were 2,192 tons sold, compared to the first six months of 2022 of 1,896 tons. Year to date sales total 3,467 tons. The lower than expected first half sales volume were a result of an extended Utah winter and flooding throughout the Central California Valley which impacted several key clients. High producer price inflation in the US also impacted on buying patterns of organic fertilizer feedstocks as aggregators and blenders preferred to preserve cash rather than build fertilizer stocks as cost pressures impacted their own operations.\nMining has commenced, later than initially planned as a result of both cash flow and inventory management which is a priority. Given our existing saleable inventory, mining for the 2023 season, between now and end-November will be between 2,500 and 4,000 tons dependent on offtake commitments from customers. Although sales for the first half of the year were below expectations, we are confident that these will pi",

The organic rock phosphate segment space remains a niche component of the vast USA agricultural and produce industry, but research broadly forecasts the segment to grow at a consolidated annual rate in excess of 8% in volume terms and 14% in USD terms which is the underlying reason for our decision to acquire the outstanding 49% shareholding in Falcon Isle.\nReporting a maiden profit for Falcon Isle in our first year of ownership has been an incredibly rewarding result from a small but very focussed team in Utah. We've demonstrated the fundamentals of the business in its current form - producing sized dry products only, but from industry engagements at trade shows and from continuing communication with industry players we've learned that there's a need for us to broaden our product range to include liquid and blended granulated products - liquids to serve the fertigation and hydroponic sectors, and granulates to align with traditional fertilizer value chain in terms of distribution and application. Testwork to produce a high available phosphate organic liquid product is ongoing and we look forward to reporting on developments in that segment. Having taken delivery of our granulator plant at the end of 2021 we took the decision to pause construction at our Spanish Fork site pending negotiations with potential partners to construct the plant to produce specific blended granulates rather than simply phosphate products which again talks to the need for a more diverse product range as we continue to gain traction in the organic market. I look forward to reporting on our granulate strategy in the near future.\nFrom a Group perspective, we believe that putting a line under the uncertainty related to our investment in Togo was a positive move and the cash received from our divestment underpins the strategy of focussing the Group's activities in North America. Our ongoing role in developing the Nay\u00e9ga Mine with the Togolese State will remain an important source of cash flow for the Group as we continue to optimise and grow Falcon Isle in Utah.\nSince the end of the year Kershner Grosso & Co (\"Kershner Grosso\"), an asset management firm headquartered in Saratoga Springs, NY, acquired a block of 10.03% of the shares in the Company previously owned by First Uranium Corporation, and have since acquired additional shares on th",

Keras was due to make a cash payment of US$800,000, being part of the consideration for the acquisition of Falcon Isle, and a US$240,000\nseverance payment (\"Total Payment\") to the former CEO of Falcon Isle (\"Helda\"),\non 1 July 2023\n.\nAs announced on 18 May 2023, the Republic of Togo (the \"State\") committed to pay a cash consideration of US$1.7 million to Keras on 17 July 2023\n. It has always been the Company's intention to make the Falcon Isle payments from the amount receivable from the State and in May 2023 the Company requested Helda for a delay in making the Total payment until 18th July - this was declined.\nDespite the deadline of July 17 for payment of the US$1.7m, the State with whom we have developed a positive rapport displayed their goodwill by issuing instructions to make the payment of 1.7 million on June 27, 2023, well ahead of schedule.\nUnfortunately, the Company had not received these funds in its own bank account at the close of business on 30 June 2023,\nand this has resulted in a technical default.\nKeras has received reassurances that the funds will be available in our account within the next 7 days\nand the default will be remedied immediately following the receipt of US$1.7 million from the State, within the 30 day period permitted in the agreement with the vendor of Falcon Isle.\nAs the Annual Report had not been released by 30 June 2023, being the deadline provided by Rule 19 of the AIM Rules for Companies (the \"AIM Rules\"), trading in the Company's ordinary shares on AIM will be suspended with effect from 7.30am on Monday 3 July 2023. The Annual Report is expected to be released as soon as the matters set out above are resolved, which is expected to be within seven days. Release of the Annual Report will permit the Company to request that the suspension is lifted.\nIn accordance with Rule 41 of the AIM Rules, the admission of the Company's shares to trading on AIM would be cancelled if the Company's shares are suspended from trading for six months.\nGraham Stacey, CEO of Keras, commented\n, \"It is very frustrating to have to delay the publishing of our accounts but it has highlighted the reason for taking 100% control of Diamond Creek and the proactive approach by the State, in fulfilling the US$1.7m payment in advance, underpins their commitment and augurs well for a productive collaboration on the Nay\u00e9ga project, benefiting all parties involved.\nThe information contained within this Announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under Article 7 of the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 (as amended) as it forms part of the domestic law of the\nUnited Kingdom\nby virtue of the\nEuropean Union\n(Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended).

I found answers to most of the questions I had asked in the last few RNS anyway with the corporate update giving a few more figures to what has already been released. I think it is in the final results RNS that a payment from Togo is expected in Q4. Corporate update says some manganese ready to be shipped, so in theory it is possible a payment could be made Q4. FI is profitable although sales were a bit lower than expected. He said he was happy with were the company is at and pointed out he took 27k in shares as payment in April I think it was. Add on todays 60k worth and that's nearly 90k in shares so guessing he must feel ok about things.",

Good to see the attendance was up, with the inclusion of a friendly old Labrador! Still, confirmation Grosso and Co are very supportive and are keeping the involvement at arm\u2019s length! The business now in the hands of the all American setup is providing us with what we\u2019d hope for in the positive running of the plant! As for Togo, got the feeling it might come good, more positive vibes from Russell than last year! Seems we are paid by the off takers, so hopefully no delays ! Russell said unlikely the volumes would require bulk shipments, but regular container loads (similar to first) are planned! He was pressed to urgently update the forecasts to give the shareholders and the market something to hold on to in the coming weeks ahead!( which Russell agreed he will try and facilitate)! I got the impression Russell doesn\u2019t give too much emphasis on sending out just noise for the sake of it; as with the very last announcement on that Friday, he was awaiting confirmation of the Togo numbers to confirm before release! So all in all a much better feel to the meeting, although time will tell with actions speaking louder \u2026 etc! PC L",

But hopefully some significant money has started to flow in: Keras Resources plc (AIM: KRS) is pleased to announce an update on the cooperation agreement signed with the Republic of Togo (\"State\") (\"Cooperation Agreement\") related to the Nay\u00e9ga manganese mine (\"Nay\u00e9ga\") in northern Togo. Nay\u00e9ga starting mining activities at the end of July 2025 and is meeting expectations of processing ore at an initial rate of 4,000 tonnes per month of saleable manganese for the first 3 months and thereafter at nameplate capacity of 8,000 tonnes per month of saleable ore. The Company has now received its first payment as per the cooperation agreement signed in 2023 post the shipment of the initial 2,700 tonnes of ore in containers on 5 September 2025. Russell Lamming, Interim Executive Chairman of Keras, commented, \"The first payment under the Cooperation Agreement is a significant milestone for both the Company and Nay\u00e9ga and we now look forward to the continued increase in production with cashflows that will underpin the cashflows from the US operations. I look forward to updating shareholders in the near term on progress on both fronts.\" GLA",

I also mentioned that according to the CLN RNS that some of the funds would also be used for working capital. This to me means we are still not generating a  profit from sales.( unless there has been an unforeseen expense which then raises more questions.) so when are we likely to be profitable? I also asked about dividends as it was mentioned in the last RNS in relation to the new shares. Normally most companies just say new shares will rank Pari Passu with existing shares, and also about royalties from Nayaga. I am still reluctant to take up the open offer unless I get a positive response from Russell but on the other hand I don't want the concert party having a controlling shareholding as they definitely don't have shareholders interests in mind.

OO at 1.4p deadline 8 August 2025 ( D ) From 26/6/25 LONDON - Keras Resources plc (AIM:KRS) has issued \u00a3750,000 in convertible loan notes (CLNs) to Christopher Grosso and Joseph Carbone, the company announced Thursday in a press release. The funds will primarily be used to pay the final $800,000 tranche to the Helda Living Trust for the acquisition of minority interests in Falcon Isle Resources Corp., which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Keras, with the remainder allocated for working capital. The CLNs, issued on June 25, are convertible into ordinary shares at 1.4 pence per share. Mr. Grosso and Mr. Carbone currently hold 21.36% and 7.42% of the company\u2019s existing share capital respectively, with Mr. Grosso subscribing through the Diane H. Grosso Credit Shelter Trust. Since conversion could result in the pair holding over 30% of Keras\u2019 issued share capital, any conversion would require Takeover Panel consent and approval from independent shareholders via a Rule 9 waiver resolution. The company also plans to launch an open offer to qualifying shareholders at 1.4 pence per share, with 542 offer shares available for every 1,000 existing shares. Proceeds from this offer will be used to repay portions of the CLNs not converted. The CLNs will initially be interest-free, but should the Rule 9 waiver resolution fail, interest would become payable at 20% annually, with potential security requirements and repayment terms activating after June 30, 2026. The transaction involving the Diane H. Grosso Credit Shelter Trust is considered a Related Party Transaction (JO:NTUJ) under AIM Rule 13, with independent directors determining the terms are fair and reasonable for shareholders.",

I found answers to most of the questions I had asked in the last few RNS anyway with the corporate update giving a few more figures to what has already been released. I think it is in the final results RNS that a payment from Togo is expected in Q4. Corporate update says some manganese ready to be shipped, so in theory it is possible a payment could be made Q4. FI is profitable although sales were a bit lower than expected. He said he was happy with were the company is at and pointed out he took 27k in shares as payment in April I think it was. Add on todays 60k worth and that's nearly 90k in shares so guessing he must feel ok about things.",

The business now in the hands of the all American setup is providing us with what we\u2019d hope for in the positive running of the plant! As for Togo, got the feeling it might come good, more positive vibes from Russell than last year! Seems we are paid by the off takers, so hopefully no delays ! Russell said unlikely the volumes would require bulk shipments, but regular container loads (similar to first) are planned! He was pressed to urgently update the forecasts to give the shareholders and the market something to hold on to in the coming weeks ahead!( which Russell agreed he will try and facilitate)! I got the impression Russell doesn\u2019t give too much emphasis on sending out just noise for the sake of it; as with the very last announcement on that Friday, he was awaiting confirmation of the Togo numbers to confirm before release! So all in all a much better feel to the meeting, although time will tell with actions speaking louder \u2026 etc! PC L",

Nay\u00e9ga starting mining activities at the end of July 2025 and is meeting expectations of processing ore at an initial rate of 4,000 tonnes per month of saleable manganese for the first 3 months and thereafter at nameplate capacity of 8,000 tonnes per month of saleable ore. The Company has now received its first payment as per the cooperation agreement signed in 2023 post the shipment of the initial 2,700 tonnes of ore in containers on 5 September 2025. Russell Lamming, Interim Executive Chairman of Keras, commented, \"The first payment under the Cooperation Agreement is a significant milestone for both the Company and Nay\u00e9ga and we now look forward to the continued increase in production with cashflows that will underpin the cashflows from the US operations. I look forward to updating shareholders in the near term on progress on both fronts.\" GLA",

I also mentioned that according to the CLN RNS that some of the funds would also be used for working capital. This to me means we are still not generating a  profit from sales.( unless there has been an unforeseen expense which then raises more questions.) so when are we likely to be profitable? I also asked about dividends as it was mentioned in the last RNS in relation to the new shares. Normally most companies just say new shares will rank Pari Passu with existing shares, and also about royalties from Nayaga. I am still reluctant to take up the open offer unless I get a positive response from Russell but on the other hand I don't want the concert party having a controlling shareholding as they definitely don't have shareholders interests in mind.

OO at 1.4p deadline 8 August 2025 ( D ) From 26/6/25 LONDON - Keras Resources plc (AIM:KRS) has issued \u00a3750,000 in convertible loan notes (CLNs) to Christopher Grosso and Joseph Carbone, the company announced Thursday in a press release. The funds will primarily be used to pay the final $800,000 tranche to the Helda Living Trust for the acquisition of minority interests in Falcon Isle Resources Corp., which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Keras, with the remainder allocated for working capital. The CLNs, issued on June 25, are convertible into ordinary shares at 1.4 pence per share. Mr. Grosso and Mr. Carbone currently hold 21.36% and 7.42% of the company\u2019s existing share capital respectively, with Mr. Grosso subscribing through the Diane H. Grosso Credit Shelter Trust. Since conversion could result in the pair holding over 30% of Keras\u2019 issued share capital, any conversion would require Takeover Panel consent and approval from independent shareholders via a Rule 9 waiver resolution. The company also plans to launch an open offer to qualifying shareholders at 1.4 pence per share, with 542 offer shares available for every 1,000 existing shares. Proceeds from this offer will be used to repay portions of the CLNs not converted. The CLNs will initially be interest-free, but should the Rule 9 waiver resolution fail, interest would become payable at 20% annually, with potential security requirements and repayment terms activating after June 30, 2026. The transaction involving the Diane H. Grosso Credit Shelter Trust is considered a Related Party Transaction (JO:NTUJ) under AIM Rule 13, with independent directors determining the terms are fair and reasonable for shareholders.",

In the event that no subscriptions are received under the Open Offer, the CLNs will be converted in full, and, as such, the resultant shareholding of Mr Grosso and Mr Carbone would increase to 31.42% and 22.44% respectively. If the total interest of the Concert Party were to exceed 50%, the Concert Party would be permitted to increase its percentage further without the requirement to make an offer under Rule 9 of the Takeover Code. However, the Takeover Code also applies to Mr Grosso and Mr Carbone individually, so that each of Mr Grosso and Mr Carbone could only increase his percentage up to 29.9%, without incurring any obligation to make an offer under Rule 9.",

He started the conversation saying he couldn't discuss anything that wasn't already in the public domain, which we all know is the case anyway. I found answers to most of the questions I had asked in the last few RNS anyway with the corporate update giving a few more figures to what has already been released. I think it is in the final results RNS that a payment from Togo is expected in Q4. Corporate update says some manganese ready to be shipped, so in theory it is possible a payment could be made Q4. FI is profitable although sales were a bit lower than expected. He said he was happy with were the company is at and pointed out he took 27k in shares as payment in April I think it was. Add on todays 60k worth and that's nearly 90k in shares so guessing he must feel ok about things.",

The business now in the hands of the all American setup is providing us with what we\u2019d hope for in the positive running of the plant! As for Togo, got the feeling it might come good, more positive vibes from Russell than last year! Seems we are paid by the off takers, so hopefully no delays ! Russell said unlikely the volumes would require bulk shipments, but regular container loads (similar to first) are planned! He was pressed to urgently update the forecasts to give the shareholders and the market something to hold on to in the coming weeks ahead!( which Russell agreed he will try and facilitate)! I got the impression Russell doesn\u2019t give too much emphasis on sending out just noise for the sake of it; as with the very last announcement on that Friday, he was awaiting confirmation of the Togo numbers to confirm before release! So all in all a much better feel to the meeting, although time will tell with actions speaking louder \u2026 etc! PC L",

Nay\u00e9ga starting mining activities at the end of July 2025 and is meeting expectations of processing ore at an initial rate of 4,000 tonnes per month of saleable manganese for the first 3 months and thereafter at nameplate capacity of 8,000 tonnes per month of saleable ore. The Company has now received its first payment as per the cooperation agreement signed in 2023 post the shipment of the initial 2,700 tonnes of ore in containers on 5 September 2025. Russell Lamming, Interim Executive Chairman of Keras, commented, \"The first payment under the Cooperation Agreement is a significant milestone for both the Company and Nay\u00e9ga and we now look forward to the continued increase in production with cashflows that will underpin the cashflows from the US operations. I look forward to updating shareholders in the near term on progress on both fronts.\" GLA",

The business now in the hands of the all American setup is providing us with what we\u2019d hope for in the positive running of the plant! As for Togo, got the feeling it might come good, more positive vibes from Russell than last year! Seems we are paid by the off takers, so hopefully no delays ! Russell said unlikely the volumes would require bulk shipments, but regular container loads (similar to first) are planned! He was pressed to urgently update the forecasts to give the shareholders and the market something to hold on to in the coming weeks ahead!( which Russell agreed he will try and facilitate)! I got the impression Russell doesn\u2019t give too much emphasis on sending out just noise for the sake of it; as with the very last announcement on that Friday, he was awaiting confirmation of the Togo numbers to confirm before release! So all in all a much better feel to the meeting, although time will tell with actions speaking louder \u2026 etc! PC L",

I found answers to most of the questions I had asked in the last few RNS anyway with the corporate update giving a few more figures to what has already been released. I think it is in the final results RNS that a payment from Togo is expected in Q4. Corporate update says some manganese ready to be shipped, so in theory it is possible a payment could be made Q4. FI is profitable although sales were a bit lower than expected. He said he was happy with were the company is at and pointed out he took 27k in shares as payment in April I think it was. Add on todays 60k worth and that's nearly 90k in shares so guessing he must feel ok about things.",

Nay\u00e9ga starting mining activities at the end of July 2025 and is meeting expectations of processing ore at an initial rate of 4,000 tonnes per month of saleable manganese for the first 3 months and thereafter at nameplate capacity of 8,000 tonnes per month of saleable ore. The Company has now received its first payment as per the cooperation agreement signed in 2023 post the shipment of the initial 2,700 tonnes of ore in containers on 5 September 2025. Russell Lamming, Interim Executive Chairman of Keras, commented, \"The first payment under the Cooperation Agreement is a significant milestone for both the Company and Nay\u00e9ga and we now look forward to the continued increase in production with cashflows that will underpin the cashflows from the US operations. I look forward to updating shareholders in the near term on progress on both fronts.\" GLA",

Your kick in the pants for more updates to shareholders going forward will be good if it indeed happens can understand his view of not reporting if there is nothing significant to say but shareholder interest is important this board is a shadow of its former self and more regular information would generate more interest in the share.

Good to see the attendance was up, with the inclusion of a friendly old Labrador! Still, confirmation Grosso and Co are very supportive and are keeping the involvement at arm\u2019s length! The business now in the hands of the all American setup is providing us with what we\u2019d hope for in the positive running of the plant! As for Togo, got the feeling it might come good, more positive vibes from Russell than last year! Seems we are paid by the off takers, so hopefully no delays ! Russell said unlikely the volumes would require bulk shipments, but regular container loads (similar to first) are planned! He was pressed to urgently update the forecasts to give the shareholders and the market something to hold on to in the coming weeks ahead!( which Russell agreed he will try and facilitate)! I got the impression Russell doesn\u2019t give too much emphasis on sending out just noise for the sake of it; as with the very last announcement on that Friday, he was awaiting confirmation of the Togo numbers to confirm before release! So all in all a much better feel to the meeting, although time will tell with actions speaking louder \u2026 etc! PC L",

He started the conversation saying he couldn't discuss anything that wasn't already in the public domain, which we all know is the case anyway. I found answers to most of the questions I had asked in the last few RNS anyway with the corporate update giving a few more figures to what has already been released. I think it is in the final results RNS that a payment from Togo is expected in Q4. Corporate update says some manganese ready to be shipped, so in theory it is possible a payment could be made Q4. FI is profitable although sales were a bit lower than expected. He said he was happy with were the company is at and pointed out he took 27k in shares as payment in April I think it was. Add on todays 60k worth and that's nearly 90k in shares so guessing he must feel ok about things.",

But hopefully some significant money has started to flow in: Keras Resources plc (AIM: KRS) is pleased to announce an update on the cooperation agreement signed with the Republic of Togo (\"State\") (\"Cooperation Agreement\") related to the Nay\u00e9ga manganese mine (\"Nay\u00e9ga\") in northern Togo. Nay\u00e9ga starting mining activities at the end of July 2025 and is meeting expectations of processing ore at an initial rate of 4,000 tonnes per month of saleable manganese for the first 3 months and thereafter at nameplate capacity of 8,000 tonnes per month of saleable ore. The Company has now received its first payment as per the cooperation agreement signed in 2023 post the shipment of the initial 2,700 tonnes of ore in containers on 5 September 2025. Russell Lamming, Interim Executive Chairman of Keras, commented, \"The first payment under the Cooperation Agreement is a significant milestone for both the Company and Nay\u00e9ga and we now look forward to the continued increase in production with cashflows that will underpin the cashflows from the US operations. I look forward to updating shareholders in the near term on progress on both fronts.\" GLA",

Russell said unlikely the volumes would require bulk shipments, but regular container loads (similar to first) are planned! He was pressed to urgently update the forecasts to give the shareholders and the market something to hold on to in the coming weeks ahead!( which Russell agreed he will try and facilitate)! I got the impression Russell doesn\u2019t give too much emphasis on sending out just noise for the sake of it; as with the very last announcement on that Friday, he was awaiting confirmation of the Togo numbers to confirm before release! So all in all a much better feel to the meeting, although time will tell with actions speaking louder \u2026 etc! PC L",

He started the conversation saying he couldn't discuss anything that wasn't already in the public domain, which we all know is the case anyway. I found answers to most of the questions I had asked in the last few RNS anyway with the corporate update giving a few more figures to what has already been released. I think it is in the final results RNS that a payment from Togo is expected in Q4. Corporate update says some manganese ready to be shipped, so in theory it is possible a payment could be made Q4. FI is profitable although sales were a bit lower than expected. He said he was happy with were the company is at and pointed out he took 27k in shares as payment in April I think it was. Add on todays 60k worth and that's nearly 90k in shares so guessing he must feel ok about things.",

The only people who gained from CLUFF / DELTIC was the directors, and there gains came from the hard earned money from retail investors, who lost their investment. Many delusional morons are still here trying to say otherwise. Im one of the only people here to call this share correct, consistently - over the last 2 years had the directors not claimed >\u00a3800k per year, this company would have millions in the bank to stay afloat.",

Nay\u00e9ga starting mining activities at the end of July 2025 and is meeting expectations of processing ore at an initial rate of 4,000 tonnes per month of saleable manganese for the first 3 months and thereafter at nameplate capacity of 8,000 tonnes per month of saleable ore. The Company has now received its first payment as per the cooperation agreement signed in 2023 post the shipment of the initial 2,700 tonnes of ore in containers on 5 September 2025. Russell Lamming, Interim Executive Chairman of Keras, commented, \"The first payment under the Cooperation Agreement is a significant milestone for both the Company and Nay\u00e9ga and we now look forward to the continued increase in production with cashflows that will underpin the cashflows from the US operations. I look forward to updating shareholders in the near term on progress on both fronts.\" GLA",

The business now in the hands of the all American setup is providing us with what we\u2019d hope for in the positive running of the plant! As for Togo, got the feeling it might come good, more positive vibes from Russell than last year! Seems we are paid by the off takers, so hopefully no delays ! Russell said unlikely the volumes would require bulk shipments, but regular container loads (similar to first) are planned! He was pressed to urgently update the forecasts to give the shareholders and the market something to hold on to in the coming weeks ahead!( which Russell agreed he will try and facilitate)! I got the impression Russell doesn\u2019t give too much emphasis on sending out just noise for the sake of it; as with the very last announcement on that Friday, he was awaiting confirmation of the Togo numbers to confirm before release! So all in all a much better feel to the meeting, although time will tell with actions speaking louder \u2026 etc! PC L",

I found answers to most of the questions I had asked in the last few RNS anyway with the corporate update giving a few more figures to what has already been released. I think it is in the final results RNS that a payment from Togo is expected in Q4. Corporate update says some manganese ready to be shipped, so in theory it is possible a payment could be made Q4. FI is profitable although sales were a bit lower than expected. He said he was happy with were the company is at and pointed out he took 27k in shares as payment in April I think it was. Add on todays 60k worth and that's nearly 90k in shares so guessing he must feel ok about things.",

Nay\u00e9ga starting mining activities at the end of July 2025 and is meeting expectations of processing ore at an initial rate of 4,000 tonnes per month of saleable manganese for the first 3 months and thereafter at nameplate capacity of 8,000 tonnes per month of saleable ore. The Company has now received its first payment as per the cooperation agreement signed in 2023 post the shipment of the initial 2,700 tonnes of ore in containers on 5 September 2025. Russell Lamming, Interim Executive Chairman of Keras, commented, \"The first payment under the Cooperation Agreement is a significant milestone for both the Company and Nay\u00e9ga and we now look forward to the continued increase in production with cashflows that will underpin the cashflows from the US operations. I look forward to updating shareholders in the near term on progress on both fronts.\" GLA",

The business now in the hands of the all American setup is providing us with what we\u2019d hope for in the positive running of the plant! As for Togo, got the feeling it might come good, more positive vibes from Russell than last year! Seems we are paid by the off takers, so hopefully no delays ! Russell said unlikely the volumes would require bulk shipments, but regular container loads (similar to first) are planned! He was pressed to urgently update the forecasts to give the shareholders and the market something to hold on to in the coming weeks ahead!( which Russell agreed he will try and facilitate)! I got the impression Russell doesn\u2019t give too much emphasis on sending out just noise for the sake of it; as with the very last announcement on that Friday, he was awaiting confirmation of the Togo numbers to confirm before release! So all in all a much better feel to the meeting, although time will tell with actions speaking louder \u2026 etc! PC L",

I found answers to most of the questions I had asked in the last few RNS anyway with the corporate update giving a few more figures to what has already been released. I think it is in the final results RNS that a payment from Togo is expected in Q4. Corporate update says some manganese ready to be shipped, so in theory it is possible a payment could be made Q4. FI is profitable although sales were a bit lower than expected. He said he was happy with were the company is at and pointed out he took 27k in shares as payment in April I think it was. Add on todays 60k worth and that's nearly 90k in shares so guessing he must feel ok about things.",

Nay\u00e9ga starting mining activities at the end of July 2025 and is meeting expectations of processing ore at an initial rate of 4,000 tonnes per month of saleable manganese for the first 3 months and thereafter at nameplate capacity of 8,000 tonnes per month of saleable ore. The Company has now received its first payment as per the cooperation agreement signed in 2023 post the shipment of the initial 2,700 tonnes of ore in containers on 5 September 2025. Russell Lamming, Interim Executive Chairman of Keras, commented, \"The first payment under the Cooperation Agreement is a significant milestone for both the Company and Nay\u00e9ga and we now look forward to the continued increase in production with cashflows that will underpin the cashflows from the US operations. I look forward to updating shareholders in the near term on progress on both fronts.\" GLA",

The business now in the hands of the all American setup is providing us with what we\u2019d hope for in the positive running of the plant! As for Togo, got the feeling it might come good, more positive vibes from Russell than last year! Seems we are paid by the off takers, so hopefully no delays ! Russell said unlikely the volumes would require bulk shipments, but regular container loads (similar to first) are planned! He was pressed to urgently update the forecasts to give the shareholders and the market something to hold on to in the coming weeks ahead!( which Russell agreed he will try and facilitate)! I got the impression Russell doesn\u2019t give too much emphasis on sending out just noise for the sake of it; as with the very last announcement on that Friday, he was awaiting confirmation of the Togo numbers to confirm before release! So all in all a much better feel to the meeting, although time will tell with actions speaking louder \u2026 etc! PC L",

I found answers to most of the questions I had asked in the last few RNS anyway with the corporate update giving a few more figures to what has already been released. I think it is in the final results RNS that a payment from Togo is expected in Q4. Corporate update says some manganese ready to be shipped, so in theory it is possible a payment could be made Q4. FI is profitable although sales were a bit lower than expected. He said he was happy with were the company is at and pointed out he took 27k in shares as payment in April I think it was. Add on todays 60k worth and that's nearly 90k in shares so guessing he must feel ok about things.",
