Full year guidance unchanged\nAvon Technologies plc issues a trading update for the first quarter of the 2026 financial year (\"Q1\"), ahead of the Group's Annual General Meeting (\"AGM\"), which will be held at its Melksham facility at 10:30am today.\nAvon Protection has continued its positive momentum with a record start to the year supported by sustained demand for our CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear) protection products, good operational gearing and a healthy order book and sales pipeline.\nTeam Wendy maintains a strong order book but saw a slower first quarter. The U.S. government shutdown delayed product testing and deliveries, which contributed to lower\u2011than\u2011expected Department of War and federal revenue in Q1. Margin was also held back by the planned increase in investment ahead of ramping production rates in Q2. Assuming no further extended government shutdowns, we expect these impacts to be temporary, with higher revenue, unwind of higher inventories and improved operational gearing expected over the remainder of the year.\nAt the Group level, we continue to anticipate full year performance consistent with the guidance provided at FY25 results in November, underpinned by continued robust demand for the Group's protective technologies.\nJos Sclater, Chief Executive Officer, commented\n:\n\"The first phase of our strategy to enhance operational performance through continuous improvement continues to deliver a stronger, more sustainable business. While there is still a lot to do to improve operational efficiency and productivity in our Cleveland facility, the momentum and capability we have built in our people is clear, we are making progress.\nHaving stabilised, strengthened and transformed Avon over the last three years, 2026 will see an increased focus on the growth stage of our strategy. We are investing across key programmes and new products that will strengthen our competitive position and expand our addressable markets. We are already seeing some promising early results.\nWe remain on track to meet or exceed our FY26 financial targets and look forward to sharing the next phase of our strategic development alongside our Interim and Full Year results.\"\nAGM Presentation and Interim Results date\nA presentation covering our recent continuous improvement activities and product innovation will be held at the AGM and will be available on our website later today:\nwww.avon-technologiesplc.com\nAvon will report Interim Results for the six months ending 31 March 2026 on 13 May 2026.\nFor further enquiries, please contact:\nAvon Technologies plc\nJos Sclater, Chief Executive Officer\nRich Cashin, Chief Financial Officer\ninvestor.relations@avon-technologiesplc.com\nGabriella Colley, Corporate Affairs Director +44 7891 206 239\nSodali & Co\nPete Lambie\navontechnologies@sodali.com\nTilly Abraham +44 7855 432 699\nAbout Avon Technologies plc:\nAvon Technologies is a Military and Law Enforcement protective equipment specialist.

This has driven a strong performance for the Group overall, with financial results for the six months ended 31 March 2025 expected to show good growth over the prior year.\nIn addition, Avon Protection has received two new European NATO orders for personal respirators for delivery to the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The first order is for FM50 respirators, and the second is for C50 protective masks. Both orders are for delivery in calendar year 2025 with some deliveries expected to be completed early in FY2026.\nAvon Protection has also signed a new framework contract from two European Navies for its MCM100 Multi-Role Rebreather, with quantities and delivery schedule to be finalised. The contract is a joint approach between these nations for MCM100 rebreather systems, related accessories, training, and maintenance and support under a 12-year program.\nOverall, additional demand will result in FY2025 revenue growth being higher than previously expected.\nIn Avon Protection, revenue growth, mix and continuous improvement are all supporting strong operating profit margins. In Team Wendy, as expected, the costs associated with ramping up production and closing our Californian factory will impact H1 but we remain confident that Team Wendy will exit FY2025 with stronger profit margins into FY2026. Overall, we expect better than originally guided operating profit margins in the current year.\nThe production ramp up of delivery volumes to the US DOD in Team Wendy remains both a risk and an opportunity. We remain focused on successfully ramping up production, mitigating risks and realising the opportunities for further margin expansion.\nFY2025 Outlook\nAvon Technologies plc is therefore issuing the following update to FY2025 guidance:\n\u00b7\nRevenue growth in excess of 10% (previous guidance: mid-single digit)\n\u00b7\nGroup adjusted operating profit margin above 12% (previous guidance: c.11.5%)\n\u00b7\nAll other FY2025 guidance remains unchanged\nNotice of HY2025 Results\nHY2025 Results are due to be released on 21 May 2025. Jos Sclater, Chief Executive Officer and Rich Cashin, Chief Financial Officer, will host a presentation for investors and sell-side analysts at 09:00 on the morning of 21 May.\nJos Sclater, CEO of Avon Technologies plc, said:\n\"We are proud of the contribution that Avon continues to provide to the security of NATO nations. The additional orders for provision of respiratory protection to Ukrainian war fighters and rebreathers for military divers allows both users to operate with confidence, knowing they are protected against increasingly prevalent threats in the harshest and most demanding environments.\"\n\"We continue to deliver in accordance with our STAR strategy. Our growing order book, progress closing our California facility and the culture, capability change and pace we are seeing as we implement continuous improvement across the Group all give us confidence for the medium term and beyond.\"\nFor further enquiries, please contact:\nAvon Technologies plc\nJos Sclater, Chief Executive Officer\nRich Cashin, Chief Financial Officer\nGabriella Colley, Corporate Affairs Director\n+44 1225 896 848\nSodali & Co\nPete Lambie\nJames White\n+44 7855 432 699\navonprotection@sodali.com\nAbout Avon Technologies plc:\nAvon Technologies plc make products that are trusted to protect the world's militaries and first responders.

I bought at the beginning of September 2021 and sold at the end of that month at a very modest profit. Bought in again a few days later (thought I acted hastily in selling - as I felt it had M&A written all over it) and have bought dips, and dips, and dips ever since. Jos and Rich have been a God send and I sense they are turning it around. However, the market is fickle and I suspect tomorrow will be a serious test. Have talked myself out of profit taking all week in search of bigger gains - due to the current conflicts and the decent contracts they are winning. This afternoon's drop was very dissapointing and I'm hoping it was just a bit of profit-taking. I'm looking at reducing, don't want to be out fully until I feel the time is right. Did you cash out completely? Fingers crossed for tomorrow (for anybody left in), as  it should be a good year if the numbers are decent.",

This morning we announced our half year results for 2024 which confirmed we have delivered a strong first half and our transformation is gaining momentum. Jos Sclater, Chief Executive Officer, commented: \u201cWe are making excellent progress towards our medium-term goals and are increasingly excited by the growing momentum in our transformation programme. The results in H1 demonstrate that our strategy is working and pace is increasing, though we still have a lot to do. The work we have done so far to drive improvement has revealed further opportunities for operational improvement; this reinforces our confidence that we will deliver our medium-term goals. \u201cWe are seeing a growing awareness of the importance of high-quality protection against chemical warfare and head injury. In particular, Russia\u2019s deployment of chemical weapons in Ukraine has highlighted the need for effective respiratory protection. As the leading supplier of mission-critical head and respiratory protection to the US Department of Defence and other NATO countries, we are well positioned to help protect the people who are protecting us. \u201cMore broadly, I am very pleased that we now have a much stronger business that is delivering on major programmes and is improving fast. We have moved quickly into execution phase of our STAR strategic plan and are already seeing productivity improvement, new contract wins and further innovation to revolutionise our world leading product portfolio.\u201d",

This gives good order cover well into FY2026. In addition, overall trading has continued to be strong into the second half of FY24 with good momentum reflected across a number of our strategic and financial KPIs. The benefits of our focus on efficiency, and good operational execution are contributing to faster than expected progress in both Strategic Business Units. As a result, the Group is today issuing the following update to FY 2024 guidance: \u00b7 Revenue growth of around 11% (from c.10% previously) \u00b7 Group adjusted operating profit margin slightly above 11% (from 10% previously) \u00b7 All other FY 2024 guidance remains unchanged FY2024 results are due to be released on 19 November 2024. Jos Sclater, CEO of Avon Protection plc, said: \"Our market leading protection technologies and contract frameworks position us well in the current geopolitical environment. We have successfully rebased the business to create a fitter, stronger organisation and it is encouraging to see the benefits of our transformation plan and continuous improvement culture drive improved financial performance. We still have a lot of work to do but are increasingly confident that our strategic initiatives will enable us to meet our medium term targets.\"",

I bought at the beginning of September 2021 and sold at the end of that month at a very modest profit. Bought in again a few days later (thought I acted hastily in selling - as I felt it had M&A written all over it) and have bought dips, and dips, and dips ever since. Jos and Rich have been a God send and I sense they are turning it around. However, the market is fickle and I suspect tomorrow will be a serious test. Have talked myself out of profit taking all week in search of bigger gains - due to the current conflicts and the decent contracts they are winning. This afternoon's drop was very dissapointing and I'm hoping it was just a bit of profit-taking. I'm looking at reducing, don't want to be out fully until I feel the time is right. Did you cash out completely? Fingers crossed for tomorrow (for anybody left in), as  it should be a good year if the numbers are decent.",

This morning we announced our half year results for 2024 which confirmed we have delivered a strong first half and our transformation is gaining momentum. Jos Sclater, Chief Executive Officer, commented: \u201cWe are making excellent progress towards our medium-term goals and are increasingly excited by the growing momentum in our transformation programme. The results in H1 demonstrate that our strategy is working and pace is increasing, though we still have a lot to do. The work we have done so far to drive improvement has revealed further opportunities for operational improvement; this reinforces our confidence that we will deliver our medium-term goals. \u201cWe are seeing a growing awareness of the importance of high-quality protection against chemical warfare and head injury. In particular, Russia\u2019s deployment of chemical weapons in Ukraine has highlighted the need for effective respiratory protection. As the leading supplier of mission-critical head and respiratory protection to the US Department of Defence and other NATO countries, we are well positioned to help protect the people who are protecting us. \u201cMore broadly, I am very pleased that we now have a much stronger business that is delivering on major programmes and is improving fast. We have moved quickly into execution phase of our STAR strategic plan and are already seeing productivity improvement, new contract wins and further innovation to revolutionise our world leading product portfolio.\u201d",

This gives good order cover well into FY2026. In addition, overall trading has continued to be strong into the second half of FY24 with good momentum reflected across a number of our strategic and financial KPIs. The benefits of our focus on efficiency, and good operational execution are contributing to faster than expected progress in both Strategic Business Units. As a result, the Group is today issuing the following update to FY 2024 guidance: \u00b7 Revenue growth of around 11% (from c.10% previously) \u00b7 Group adjusted operating profit margin slightly above 11% (from 10% previously) \u00b7 All other FY 2024 guidance remains unchanged FY2024 results are due to be released on 19 November 2024. Jos Sclater, CEO of Avon Protection plc, said: \"Our market leading protection technologies and contract frameworks position us well in the current geopolitical environment. We have successfully rebased the business to create a fitter, stronger organisation and it is encouraging to see the benefits of our transformation plan and continuous improvement culture drive improved financial performance. We still have a lot of work to do but are increasingly confident that our strategic initiatives will enable us to meet our medium term targets.\"",

Full year guidance unchanged\nAvon Technologies plc issues a trading update for the first quarter of the 2026 financial year (\"Q1\"), ahead of the Group's Annual General Meeting (\"AGM\"), which will be held at its Melksham facility at 10:30am today.\nAvon Protection has continued its positive momentum with a record start to the year supported by sustained demand for our CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear) protection products, good operational gearing and a healthy order book and sales pipeline.\nTeam Wendy maintains a strong order book but saw a slower first quarter. The U.S. government shutdown delayed product testing and deliveries, which contributed to lower\u2011than\u2011expected Department of War and federal revenue in Q1. Margin was also held back by the planned increase in investment ahead of ramping production rates in Q2. Assuming no further extended government shutdowns, we expect these impacts to be temporary, with higher revenue, unwind of higher inventories and improved operational gearing expected over the remainder of the year.\nAt the Group level, we continue to anticipate full year performance consistent with the guidance provided at FY25 results in November, underpinned by continued robust demand for the Group's protective technologies.\nJos Sclater, Chief Executive Officer, commented\n:\n\"The first phase of our strategy to enhance operational performance through continuous improvement continues to deliver a stronger, more sustainable business. While there is still a lot to do to improve operational efficiency and productivity in our Cleveland facility, the momentum and capability we have built in our people is clear, we are making progress.\nHaving stabilised, strengthened and transformed Avon over the last three years, 2026 will see an increased focus on the growth stage of our strategy. We are investing across key programmes and new products that will strengthen our competitive position and expand our addressable markets. We are already seeing some promising early results.\nWe remain on track to meet or exceed our FY26 financial targets and look forward to sharing the next phase of our strategic development alongside our Interim and Full Year results.\"\nAGM Presentation and Interim Results date\nA presentation covering our recent continuous improvement activities and product innovation will be held at the AGM and will be available on our website later today:\nwww.avon-technologiesplc.com\nAvon will report Interim Results for the six months ending 31 March 2026 on 13 May 2026.\nFor further enquiries, please contact:\nAvon Technologies plc\nJos Sclater, Chief Executive Officer\nRich Cashin, Chief Financial Officer\ninvestor.relations@avon-technologiesplc.com\nGabriella Colley, Corporate Affairs Director +44 7891 206 239\nSodali & Co\nPete Lambie\navontechnologies@sodali.com\nTilly Abraham +44 7855 432 699\nAbout Avon Technologies plc:\nAvon Technologies is a Military and Law Enforcement protective equipment specialist.

Also noted a mistake in the RNS: the \"Total dividend per share\" is reported as a 21.3% increase, where it should be reported as a loss in parenthesis (21.3%). Does anyone know how to report this to AVON? Some caveats in the outlook for next year, though: \"cost headwind due to increase US healthcare costs and Employers National Insurance contributions in the UK.\" \"we expect: mid-single-digit revenue growth, and operating profit margin broadly flat year-on-year\". Still, it looks a favourable time to average down.",
