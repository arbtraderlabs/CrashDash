From the 2020 PEA, the measured and indicated resource is 22,909,059 tonnes at an average grade of 0.38% copper, 0.324 grammes per tonne (\"g/t\") gold, 10.3 g/t silver, and 0.19% zinc. The contained metal for the measured and indicated resource is 87,543 tonnes of copper, 238,406 ounces of gold, 7,595,198 ounces of silver and 43,871 tonnes of zinc.\nIn addition to Empire, the district includes the historic Horseshoe, White Knob and Blue\u00a0Bird Mines, past producers of copper, gold, silver, zinc, lead and tungsten from underground mines. A new discovery at\u00a0Red Star, 330 metres northwest of the\u00a0Empire Mine\u00a0proposed open pit, has revealed high grade silver / lead sulphide ore, and from three shallow exploration drill holes a maiden inferred resource of 103,000 tonnes containing 173.4 g/t silver, 0.85 g/t gold and 3.85% lead (1.6 million ounces silver equivalent) was reported in an NI 43-101 technical report published in\u00a0May 2019. Additionally, the district includes\u00a0Navarre Creek, a volcanic hosted precious metals target in a 16.09 sq km area. The Company's total land package at Empire comprises 8,434 acres (34.13 sq kms).\nAt Empire, it is estimated that less than 1% of the potential ore system has been explored to date and, accordingly, there is significant opportunity to increase the resource through phased exploration. The stated aim of the Company is to fund this phased exploration through free cashflow generated by its initial mine. A Plan of Operations in respect of the initial open pit mine was filed with the relevant regulatory authorities in\u00a0June 2021.\nPhoenix\u00a0also has two wholly owned cobalt properties on the Idaho Cobalt Belt to the north of Empire. An Earn-In Agreement has been signed with Electra Battery Materials,\u00a0Toronto, in respect of one of those properties.\nPhoenix\u00a0is listed on\u00a0London's\u00a0AIM (PXC), and trades on\u00a0New York's\u00a0OTCQX Market (PXCLF and PXCLY (ADRs)).

The historic Empire underground mine, located beneath the surface of the Company's proposed open pit, boasts a rich history of producing high-grade copper, gold, silver, zinc, and tungsten.\nSince 2017, Phoenix has executed extensive drilling initiatives, resulting in an expansion of the Empire Open-Pit resource by over 200%. The measured and indicated resource currently stands at 22,909,059 tonnes, with an average grade of 0.38% copper, 0.324 grams per tonne (\"g/t\") gold, 10.3 g/t silver, and 0.19% zinc. This resource represents 87,543 tonnes of copper, 238,406 ounces of gold, and 7,595,198 ounces of silver.\nIn addition to the Empire Mine, Phoenix's holdings in the district also encompass the Horseshoe, White Knob, and Blue Bird Mines, all of which have been producers of copper, gold, silver, zinc, lead, and tungsten from underground operations, a new high-grade silver and lead orebody at Red Star, and the Navarre Creek gold exploration project, which was first drilled in 2023. The Company's land package at Empire spans 8,434 acres (34.13 sq km).\nPhoenix also owns two cobalt properties situated along the Idaho Cobalt Belt to the north of Empire. An Earn-In Agreement has been established with Electra Battery Materials, Toronto, concerning one of these properties.\nPhoenix\u00a0is listed on\u00a0London's\u00a0AIM (PXC), and trades on\u00a0New York's\u00a0OTCQX Market (PXCLF and PXCLY (ADRs)).
