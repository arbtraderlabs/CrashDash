The Company is also pleased to confirm the effect of increased metal prices on its 2024 Empire open-pit pre-feasibility study (\"PFS\") economic model.\nPartial Conversion of CLN\nFurther to the announcement on 4 December 2025, the Company confirms that the CLN holder, Indigo, has converted $536,000 at 1.483 pence per share into 26,981,814 new ordinary shares of no par value in the Company (\"New Ordinary Shares\").\nApplication has been made for the New Ordinary Shares to be admitted to trading on AIM (\"Admission\"). It is expected that Admission will become effective and dealings will commence at 8:00 am on or around 26 January 2026.\nThe Company has been informed that Indigo has entered into agreements to divest 24,181,814 of the New Ordinary Shares to various equity funds and family offices in Europe and elsewhere, as soon as practicable following Admission.\nTotal Voting Rights\nFollowing Admission, the Company will have 287,995,114 ordinary shares outstanding. Shareholders may use this number as the denominator for the calculation by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change in their interest in, the issued share capital of the Company.\nPotential Impact of Current Metal Prices on the 2024 Economic Model\nThe 2024 open-pit PFS economic model (the \"2024 Model\") was generated at the time using conservative, near-term trailing average metal prices of $4.45 / lb copper price, a $2,325 / oz gold price and a $27.25 / oz silver price. In order to illustrate the potential impact of current metal prices on the economics of the open pit, the Company has applied the following metal pricing to the 2024 Model; $5.58 / lb copper, $4,338 / oz gold and $70.73 / oz silver. Should these metal prices be maintained, the impact would be significant and would result in cumulative pre-tax net (after repaying estimated pre-production capital costs) cashflow of $405.80 million over the 8.5 year life of mine, as well as a 7.5% pre-tax Net Present Value (\"NPV\") of $252.11 million and a pre-tax Internal Rate of Return of 98.4%.\nA comparison of the impact to the 2024 Model is summarised in the table below:\nProject Evaluation Overview\n2024 PFS Before Tax / After Tax\n2026 Before Tax / After Tax\n% Change\nCumulative Net Cashflow (millions)\n$152.98 / $132.44\n$405.80 / $350.89\n165.3 / 164.9% Increase\nNPV @ 5.0% (millions)\n$105.44 / $89.55\n$293.85 / $252.34\n178.7 / 181.8% Increase\nNPV @ 7.5% (millions)\n$87.86 / $73.75\n$252.11 / $215.67\n186.9 / 192.4% Increase\nNPV @ 10.0% (millions)\n$73.29 / $60.71\n$217.34 / $185.17\n196.5 / 205% Increase\nInternal Rate of Return\n46.4% / 40.2%\n98.4% / 86.6%\n52 / 46.4% Increase\nThe 2026 Before Tax / After Tax results presented above have been internally estimated by the Company and have not been verified by the Company's independent technical consultants or Qualified Person. The results of this comparison are illustrative only and are not intended to imply a change in the Empire open pit mineral reserve nor are they intended to imply a new or updated Empire open pit economic model.\nThe Company also refers to its ongoing discussions with the US based bond investor (the \"Investor\"), first announced on 12 June 2025. These discussions have taken longer than initially anticipated due to other transactions the Investor has been completing. Although there can be no certainty a definitive agreement will be reached with the Investor, the Directors look forward to finalising the discussions and progressing towards completion. The Company looks forward to providing shareholders with further updates as appropriate.\nMarket Abuse Regulation (MAR) Disclosure\nThe Company deems the information contained within this announcement to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014, which has been incorporated into\u00a0UK\u00a0law by the\u00a0European Union\u00a0(Withdrawal) Act 2018.

The historic Empire underground mine, located beneath the surface of the Company's proposed open pit, boasts a rich history of producing high-grade copper, gold, silver, zinc, and tungsten.\nSince 2017,\u00a0Phoenix\u00a0has executed extensive drilling initiatives, resulting in an expansion of the Empire Open-Pit resource by over 200%. In\u00a0May 2024\u00a0the Company published its inaugural mineral reserve statement for the\u00a0Empire Open-Pit Mine. Proven and Probable mineral reserves are 10.1 million tonnes containing 109,487,970 lbs of copper, 104,000 oz of gold and 4,654,400 oz of silver.
