Copper is now trading at $4.60/lb, compared with our cash cost of production of $2.44/lb. Few of you will need reminding of the paucity of our current market capitalisation, which is a fraction of the funding we are seeking in order to complete construction of the Empire open-pit mine. Despite this, negotiations to place additional corporate copper bonds to raise the necessary finance appear to be nearing completion, following which we can firmly focus on achieving first production at Empire.\nAs our CEO will allude to in his statement, copper fundamentals have strengthened significantly over the summer and are not so dependent on the Chinese construction industry. Recent announcements from the US regarding AI investment in the UK, for example, were genuinely surprising to many observers, both in terms of size and the fact that they are actually happening.\nMany analysts are forecasting the copper price to rise to $13,000/tonne, which would add over $280 million to our open-pit bottom line on copper alone, without blending in any of the higher-grade underground ore, which we hope to be able to do once we have driven our proposed adit towards the known high-grade sulphide mineralisation.\nSome commentators are also forecasting gold to increase to $5,000/oz. If this proves to be correct, that would add a further $100 million to the bottom line, with an additional $40 million for silver if the ratio to gold remains constant.\nFor the moment, as evidenced by the Anglo/Teck merger, mining companies still prefer to buy each other, rather than spend money on new projects, although this may be changing. Nevertheless, we expect to be in production long before the likes of Resolution start their operations.\nI would like to re-emphasise that the Empire open-pit project is the first of several strings to our bow: apart from the underground copper sulphides, the Red Star silver project, the Navarre Creek gold prospect, along with the White Knob and Windy Devil mineralised districts, all await funding amidst improving market sentiment. I thank you all for your continued patience.\nMarcus Edwards-Jones\nExecutive Chairman\n29 September 2025\nCHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S REPORT\nAs we finalize funding for the completion of detailed engineering, permitting, and construction of the Empire Open-Pit, the operations team spent the summer sorting the last of the project data that will be required by our consulting team to compile the final engineering document and roll that data into a revised Plan of Operations. The team has also completed the required 2025 reclamation work in the Navarre Creek area and hope for a long, cool autumn to further facilitate revegetation of drill roads and drill pads. The Company's assets, including our mining claims, buildings, and equipment continue to be maintained and kept in top shape.\nArchaeological surveying of the waste rock facility and access road was completed this month, as were a number of other land surveys. This information will be used to augment the detailed engineering and Plan of Operations. Purchasing capital items and engaging consultants has obviously slowed while we await additional funding, but valuable work continues to be prioritized as we prepare for final engineering and permitting.\nThe prices of gold, silver, and copper, the predominant metals hosted in the Empire deposit, have increased in value significantly since the publication of the Company's PFS a year ago. The cash flow model presented in the PFS for the Empire Open-Pit used trailing average pricing for copper, gold, and silver, and were $4.45/lb copper, $2,325/oz gold, and $27.25/oz silver, respectively. As of this report, copper trades at $4.60, gold at $3,719, and silver at $43.30, which, if maintained, will materially improve the cumulative net free cash flow of the project by more than $80 million.\nThe increase in metal prices, which we believe will continue on an upward trend, adds considerable value to the Empire project. Over the estimated 8-year open pit mine life, we anticipate producing\n89,094,705 copper lbs (40,424 metric tonnes (\"mt\"), 40,161 oz gold, and 1,759,717 oz silver, with an estimated $62.6 million capex and total cash operating cost of $2.44/lb of copper equivalent metal. The PFS showed pre-tax economics of $87.86 million discounted net present value at 7.5% (\"NPV7.5\"), a 46.4% internal rate of return (\"IRR\"), and cumulative net free cashflow of US$152.98 million, at the lower metal prices used. The combination of strong metal prices and stable energy prices improves these figures significantly.\nThese metal prices are significant and exciting for Phoenix because the Empire mineral reserves host all three metals, and the crush-grind-flotation-tank leach-cementation circuit recently designed for processing Empire ore will recover all three metals. Copper, gold, and silver production\nis highlighted in the 2024 PFS and is made possible employing standard open-pit mining methods and the recently designed milling process. The processing facility has been engineered with a small enough footprint for siting on the Company's patented mining claims near the open pit. The proximity of the mill to the open pit reduces the haulage distance of the ore to the crusher, which requires a smaller mining fleet in terms of truck count and size, thereby reducing both capital and operating costs. The mill will produce two pay streams, a copper, gold, silver concentrate stream and a cement copper stream, both of which will be shipped to market without the need for further processing or refining at the Empire site.\nIn addition to processing ore from the Empire open-pit, the flotation circuit will be capable of recovering copper, gold, and silver as a concentrate from the high-grade sulphide vein material that exists below the open pit and was mined extensively until the early 1940s. The Empire team is currently finalizing a plan to advance the exploration of the deeper sulphide vein system with an eye on augmenting the open pit ore with feed from the higher-grade sulphide vein system below the pit. The planning includes driving an adit toward known sulphide mineralization and developing underground drilling stations along the length of the adit. Known sulphide mineralization includes the 8.38% copper interval intercepted in the 2021 core drilling program, which also assayed 1.31 grammes per tonne (\"g/t\") gold and 120 g/t silver. Historically mined grades from the sulphide vein system below the open pit were recorded as high as 8% copper, with smelter recoveries of the time recorded as averaging 3.64% copper, 1.64 g/t gold, and 54 g/t silver. Resources permitting, we hope to commence underground work during the 2025/2026 winter season.\nIn addition to the ball mills, assay laboratory, various pieces of rolling stock, and the tails filtration units already on site in Mackay, the team has identified and located the other necessary capital items and will be ready to purchase and ship those items as funding becomes available and as long as the weather chooses to cooperate.\nThe need for copper and other critical metals continues to make the news on a daily basis. This is especially true of the AI revolution. The amount of electricity required for a single AI query is estimated at around 3 watt-hours, nearly ten times that of a traditional query. The electricity requirements necessary for millions of queries a day demand significant investment in energy infrastructure. Copper and other metals critical for power generation, transmission, and the growth of energy infrastructure will continue to be in high demand. The importance of producing these metals domestically, creating a secure domestic supply chain, is now at the forefront, with the current White House administration leading the charge.\nWe currently have well-developed exploration plans for the Empire underground copper sulphides, as well as continued exploration in the Red Star, Horseshoe, Windy Devil, and Navarre Creek areas, resources permitting.\n2024 Empire Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves\nA Proven and Probable reserve estimate was completed by Hardrock Consulting in April 2024 and reported for the polymetallic Empire Mine open-pit oxide deposit. The estimate reports Proven and Probable reserves in the Empire open-pit oxide deposit of 10,097,000 tonnes containing 49,677 mt of copper, 104,000 oz of gold, and 4,654,400 oz of silver, for a combined 66,467 mt of copper equivalent metal. It was estimated using assay data from 485 drill holes, extensive geological modelling, metallurgical recovery test work, geotechnical evaluation, and mine design.\nMineral Reserve Statement for Empire Mine, after Hard Rock Consulting April 2024\nFully diluted tonnes at a Net Smelter Return (\"NSR\") cut-off of\u00a0$22.59/mt\nClassification\nTonnes\nCopper\nGold\nSilver\nCopper Equivalent\n(x1000)\n%\nlb (x1000)\ngpt\noz (x1000)\ngpt\noz (x1000)\n%\nlbs (x1000)\ntonnes\nProven\n7,515\n0.49\n81,070.56\n0.38\n90.9\n14.42\n3,483.70\n0.68\n111,995.19\n50,814\nProbable\n2,582\n0.5\n28,417.41\n0.16\n13.2\n14.1\n1,170.70\n0.61\n34,498.69\n15,652\nProven + Probable\n10,097\n0.49\n109,487.97\n0.32\n104\n14.34\n4,654.40\n0.66\n146,493.89\n66,467\nThe mineral reserves reported herein for the Empire project have been estimated in a manner consistent with the NI 43-101\u00a0Committee of Mineral Reserves International Reporting Standards\u00a0(CRIRSCO), of which both the\u00a0Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) and Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (the JORC Code) are members.\n2024 PFS - Summary of Economic Results\nThe economic analysis of the base case scenario for the Empire open-pit mine uses metal prices of $4.45/lb for copper, $2,325/oz for gold and $27.25/oz for silver. The economic model shows a pre-tax NPV7.5 of $87.86 million using a $22.59/tonne NSR cut-off, as well as a pre-tax IRR of 46.4%. The table below summarises the projected cashflow, NPV at varying rates, IRR, years of positive cash flows to repay the negative cash flow (\"Payback Period\"), and multiple of positive cash flows compared to the maximum negative cash flow (\"Payback Multiple\") on both after-tax and before-tax bases.\nProject Evaluation Overview\nAfter Tax\nBefore Tax\nCumulative Net Cashflow\n$132.44\n$152.98\nNPV @ 5.0%; (millions)\n$89.55\n$105.44\nNPV @ 7.5%; (millions)\n$73.75\n$87.86\nNPV @ 10.0%; (millions)\n$60.71\n$73.29\nInternal Rate of Return\n40.2%\n46.4%\nPayback Period\n1.66\n1.41\nPayback Multiple\n2.92\n3.21\nBenefit Cost Ratio\n7.61\n8.87\nInitial Capital\n$62.60\n$62.60\nMax.

Cashflow (millions)\n-$69.09\n-$69.09\nThe metal prices used in the PFS economic analysis were based on near-term trailing averages at the time the PFS was being written and were considered to be conservative. The Company will consider reevaluating these lower metal prices as part of the final detailed engineering work, and if determined prudent, will reoptimize the economics using higher updated metal prices.\nPFS - Metallurgy and Process Design\n3,502 feet (1,067 metres) of core from the Empire copper oxide deposit was sampled and evaluated for the metallurgical recovery of copper, gold, and silver. The results of the metallurgical test work, as presented in the PFS, show that a crush-grind-flotation-tank leach milling process provides the optimum metal recoveries for the cost. The flotation-leaching circuit that has been designed for the Empire open-pit ore has a much smaller footprint than a classic heap leach design, allowing for the processing plant to be sited on the Company's patented (private) mining claims near the open pit. The proximity of the plant to the open pit will reduce overall operating costs by reducing the ore haulage distance. The improved haulage cycle-time gained from the shortened haulage distance also allows for the use of smaller, less expensive haul trucks.\nIn addition to the cost benefits of a smaller footprint plant sited on private land, the flotation-leaching circuit will be capable of processing sulphide material, currently being explored elsewhere on the Empire property. From an environmental permitting standpoint, siting the processing plant on private land should help to simplify the overall permitting process.\nThe flotation + leaching metallurgical recovery results and reserve pit optimization parameters are shown in the table below.

Red Star was identified from a 20-metre wide surface outcrop across a skarn structure.\nIn May 2019, the Company announced a small maiden Inferred sulphide resource of 103,500 tonnes, containing 577,000 ounces of silver, 3,988 tonnes of lead, 957 tonnes of zinc, 338 tonnes of copper, and 2,800 ounces of gold, as summarized in the table below.\nClass\ntonnes\nAg\nAg\nAu\nAu\nPb\nPb\nZn\nZn\nCu\nCu\ng/t\noz\ng/t\nOz\n%\nlb\n%\nlb\n%\nlb\n(x1000)\n(x1000)\n(x1000)\n(x1000)\n(x1000)\n%\n(x1000)\nInferred\n103.56\n173.4\n577.3\n0.851\n2.8\n3.85\n8,791.20\n0.92\n2,108.80\n0.33\n745\nNavarre Creek Gold Claim Block\nDuring the summer of 2023, 28 reverse-circulation drill holes were completed into four target areas within the 16.18 square kilometre (\"sq km\") Navarre Creek gold claim block. Drilling at two of the four target areas resulted in the identification of continuous, low-grade gold mineralization ranging from 4.5 metres to 22.9 metres thick in the Lehman Creek target area, and anomalous silver and antimony along a structure in the west fork of Navarre Creek.\nThe initial assays from the two Navarre Creek targets showed low-grade mineralization worthy of further investigation. As a result, an additional 400 acres of unpatented mining claims were staked to the south-west of the Lehman Creek fault target, expanding our Navarre Creek claim block to 197 unpatented claims covering 4,070 acres.\nEmpire Mine Expansion - Horseshoe, Whiteknob, and Windy Devil\nThe Horseshoe, Whiteknob, and Windy Devil claim blocks, located immediately north of the Empire Mine project, are situated within the core of the Empire mineralization and remain attractive exploration targets. The core Empire claim group has grown to 8,434 acres (34.13 sq kms) by expanding north to the former Horseshoe and Whiteknob Mines and onto Windy Devil. This expansion covers approximately 30 historic adits, shafts and prospects, which exhibit geology and mineralogy similar to Red Star, and which will be the subject of further exploration going forward.\nIdaho Cobalt Belt - Redcastle and Bighorn Projects\nThe Company owns two strategically located properties on the Idaho Cobalt Belt in Lemhi County, Idaho: Redcastle and Bighorn. The Redcastle property is held by Borah Resources, our 100% owned, Idaho registered subsidiary. In May 2021, the Redcastle holding was signed to an earn-in agreement with Electra Battery Materials Corporation, the Toronto-based owner of the Iron Creek Cobalt Mine, which shares a common border with the Redcastle property.\nThe earn-in agreement with Electra Battery Materials on the Company's Redcastle cobalt project was renewed and extended in mid-2024.\nThe Bighorn property, located on the northern end of the Idaho Cobalt Belt, is held by Salmon Canyon Resources, another 100% owned, Idaho registered subsidiary. Bighorn is situated east of the historic Salmon Canyon copper cobalt underground mine and shares a common border with New World Resources' Colson cobalt-copper project.\nIn addition to copper, cobalt is a critical metal for electric vehicles and global electrification projects. Cobalt deposits are rare, particularly in first-world jurisdictions. The Company's cobalt projects are located in the USA's only prospective cobalt region, the Idaho Cobalt Belt, approximately 100 miles north of the Empire Mine. In 2018, we announced the results of our 2017 reconnaissance program of 46 surface grab samples which gave cobalt values ranging from 2 parts per million (ppm) to 0.31% cobalt.\nOutlook\nGold prices have risen over $1,000/oz over the past year and silver is up $12/oz in the same period. Copper is holding strong above $4.50/lb after hitting $5.79/lb for a brief period in July. Current metal prices are significantly higher than the pricing used in the PFS, and analysts continue to predict even higher prices in the future. There is a continued recognition of the importance of domestic metals production, as well as the development of new domestic energy sources and new domestic manufacturing, all of which will create an additional demand for the very minerals that we will produce on our Idaho projects.\nWe believe we have simplified the overall permitting process by siting the open pit and processing facility on private land. Our team is focused on completing all of the necessary detailed engineering required to submit a Plan of Operations and successfully permit and construct the open pit mine. While we finalize funding for this engineering and for construction, we continue to advance the project and maintain our current assets. It is important that I mention that all of the work completed this year has been done with zero health and safety related incidents to employees and contractors.\nConclusion\nThe Company's focus in 2025 has been to continue advancing the project to final engineering, permitting, and ultimately construction, and all of the information developed for the PFS is being used to accomplish that. I understand first-hand the frustration of funding delays and appreciate everyone's continued patience. The project will be in a good position as soon as funding is finalized.\nOur team of engineers, geoscientists, and industry consultants continue to do an excellent job moving the Company to the next stage of development.\nAs I have said before, and will continue to say, thank you to all of our professional staff, consultants and advisors, all of whom work tirelessly to accomplish our common goal of metal production. And I would like to thank our community liaisons, shareholders, and directors for their considerable support.\nRyan McDermott\nChief Executive Officer\n29 September 2025\nESG & SUSTAINABILITY COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN'S REPORT\nI am delighted to report on the most recent activities of the Environmental, Social & Governance (\"ESG\") & Sustainability Committee.\nAs reported in the Annual Report & Accounts, the PFS published in September 2024 indicates with reasonably high confidence that almost all infrastructure, including the processing facility, will be confined to private rather than federal land, resulting in several environmental and economic benefits. The haulage distance between the pit and the processing facility will be shorter, requiring not only fewer drivers, but also fewer and smaller trucks and less fuel to transport ore. This will reduce the overall carbon footprint of the project, as well as the operational costs. The facility is designed as zero-liquid discharge, i.e. all process water will be recirculated, except for water used for dust suppression. Tailings will be filtered and de-watered prior to stacking. And as the CEO confirms in his report, all work done over 2024 and 2025 has resulted in zero health and safety related incidents to employees or contractors.\nConstruction of the mine is estimated at 6-9 months and will take place in phases, significantly reducing the impact on the community of construction workers. We have used investor funds to purchase pre-owned equipment, including ball mills, a full metallurgical/assay laboratory and a disk filtration circuit. This not only greatly reduces our capital outlay, but pre-owned equipment is a more environmentally sound option as it maximises the resources and energy already used to produce it, and reduces industrial waste that would otherwise go to landfill or would require significant amounts of energy for its disposal.\nWe have recently received the results of our latest Digbee ESG report, based on our submission of 7 July 2025. Once again, we have been awarded an overarching score of 'A', with a project score of 'A', and a corporate score of 'BB'. Our positive score reflects that copper and silver are classed as Critical Minerals, essential for the energy transition. The Empire Mine is a brownfield site, and the Company will redevelop it using modern, environmentally responsible extraction methods, with the old workings absorbed into the operation's mine plan and rehabilitated accordingly. The existence of the Konnex Community Advisory Team (KCAT) ensures that community priorities are at the forefront of our operational decision-making, while promoting transparency and open dialogue. The community remains supportive of our activities, although our local stakeholders share our frustration that the project has not progressed at the originally anticipated speed. Lastly, the report advises that we integrate ESG performance targets and outcomes into executive compensation and incentive structures. We will consider how best to achieve this as the Company nears production.\nOur PFS allayed many local concerns, and the expectation remains that our project will have many positive impacts on Mackay and the other surrounding towns: employment and entrepreneurial opportunities, an increase in the local tax take and a resulting increase in public spending, and greater numbers of children in the local schools. Overall, a productive mine will result in more year-round residents in what is currently a predominantly summertime community.\nWe look forward to updating you with our progress in the future.\nCatherine Evans\nNon-Executive Director\nESG & Sustainability Committee Chairman\n29 September 2025\nFinancial Overview\nFor the Period ended 30 June 2025 the Group reports a loss of $0.74 million (2024: a loss of $1.10 million). Net assets totalled $41.64 million (2024: $48.55 million), including $44.34 million (2024: $42.11 million) relating to the Empire Mine, and $0.56 million (2024: $2.72 million) in cash.\nThe Company reports a profit for the Period of $0.55 million (2024: a loss of $0.05 million), and net assets of $50.68 million (2024: $55.16 million). During the Period the Company charged its subsidiary entities $0.45 million (2024: $0.45 million) in respect of management services provided, and $0.98 million (2024: $0.91 million) in respect of interest on inter-company loans, the latter eliminating on consolidation. At 30 June 2025, the Company's loans to Konnex Resources and KPX Holdings stood at $33.79 million (2024: $31.20 million) and $6.35 million (2024: $6.27 million) respectively. These loans will be repaid from operating cash flow in due course and are intended, together with royalties receivable from Konnex, to form a platform for a future proposed dividend policy to return money to shareholders.\nDuring the Period the Company issued 32,500,000 ordinary shares of no par value (\"Ordinary Shares\") at an average issue price of $0.044 per share, including 22,500,000 Ordinary Shares from subscriptions for cash, and 10,000,000 Ordinary Shares pursuant to the conversion of borrowings, raising a total of $1.44 million, before share issue expenses. Since the Period-end a further 11,779,932 Ordinary Shares have been issued at an average issue price of $0.040 per share, pursuant to conversion of borrowings totalling $0.47 million. The outstanding share capital of the Company is currently 241,464,024 Ordinary Shares.\nPost Period-end the Company restructured its short-term loan facility, drawing down a further $640,000 and extending the maturity date to 30 June 2026. Pursuant to the restructuring, the outstanding balance on the facility was $2,005,000. The loan remains unsecured and attracts interest at 15% per annum.\nOn 27 December 2023 the Company created a class of corporate copper bonds in an authorised amount of $300 million. $110 million in principal value of bonds were issued and deposited with The Bank of New York Mellon (\"BNYM\") as Settlement Agent, pending onward transfer to bond investors. The bonds are not convertible, are secured on the Group's interests in the Empire open pit mine, and are listed on The International Stock Exchange in the Channel Islands (\"TISE\"), under the ticker PHCOUSDN. In 2024 the Company placed $5 million in principal value of bonds with a private investor.\nThe Company is currently in advanced discussions with further private investors with a view to placing an additional minimum of $75 million in principal value of bonds. Although there can be no certainty, the Directors remain confident that these additional bonds will be placed and further updates relating to bond financing will be provided as appropriate.\nThe Company's Ordinary Shares are listed on AIM, operated by the London Stock Exchange, under the ticker PXC, and are also admitted to trading on New York's OTCQX Market in the form of American Depository Receipts (\"ADRs\") under the ticker PXCLY, with each ADR comprising 10 Ordinary Shares.

The Empire Mine has not yet recommenced production and no depreciation has been charged in the statement of comprehensive income.\nThere has been no impairment charged related to the mine construction and related resources in any period due to the early stage in the Group's project to reactivate the mine. However, the market capitalisation of the Group is below the carrying value of the mining asset, which is an indicator of impairment.

Since the period end the loan has been extended to 30 June 2026, unless the Company redeems the loan earlier. The loan remains unsecured and attracts interest at 15% per annum.\n10-year Copper Bonds\nOn 27 December 2023 the Company created a class of corporate copper bonds in an authorised amount of $300 million. $110 million in principal value of bonds were issued and deposited with The Bank of New York Mellon as Settlement Agent, pending onward transfer to bond investors.\nThe bonds are not convertible, are secured on the Group's interests in the Empire open pit mine, and are listed on The International Stock Exchange in the Channel Islands (\"TISE\"), under the ticker PHCOUSDN.\nIn 2024 the Company placed $5 million in principal value of bonds with a private investor. The Company is currently in advanced discussions with further private investors with a view to placing an additional minimum of $75 million in principal value of bonds.\nAt 30 June 2025 $1.39 million of bond issue expenses have been carried forward to be deducted from proceeds proportionately by tranche of bonds placed, and amortised to finance costs over the expected life of each tranche of bonds placed.\nThe bonds have a final maturity of ten years with bond investor option to request redemption at principal value after six years, and the Company's option to offer early redemption at a 10% premium to principal value after five years. The bonds will remain listed on TISE until the earlier of redemption or maturity.\nThe bonds pay a floating rate coupon subject to a minimum of 8.5% per annum and a maximum of 20%. The floating rate coupon is calculated as to the higher of a copper price coupon linked to the copper price on the London Metal Exchange, or an interest rate coupon linked to the US Federal Discount Rate. The coupon is only payable on the principal value of bonds placed.\n13\nProvisions for other liabilities\n30 June\n2025\n30 June\n2024\n31 December 2024\n$\n$\n$\nRoyalties payable\n657,702\n657,702\n657,702\nThe provision of $657,702 arises from a business combination in 2017 and comprises potential royalties payable in respect of future production at the Empire Mine. This liability will only be payable if the Empire Mine is successfully restored to production and will be deducted from the royalties payable. The amount of the provision will be reassessed as exploration work continues and on commencement of commercial production.\n14\nShare capital\nUnaudited Number\nUnaudited Number\nAudited Number\n30 June\n30 June\n31 December\n2025\n2024\n2024\nNumber of ordinary shares of no-par value\nAt the beginning of the period\n197,184,092\n124,928,622\n124,928,622\nIssued in the period\n32,500,000\n60,030,345\n72,255,470\nAt the end of the period\n229,684,092\n184,958,967\n197,184,092\nThe Company does not have an authorised capital and is authorised to issue an unlimited number of no-par value shares of a single class.\nIn the period the Company issued 32,500,000 ordinary shares at an average issue price of $0.044 per share to raise $1.44 million gross, before share-issue expenses.\nSince the period end the Company has issued a further 11,779,932 ordinary shares at an average issue price of $0.040 per share to raise $0.47 million gross, before share-issue expenses.\nThe ordinary shares in the Company have no par value.

The historic Empire underground mine, located beneath the surface of the Company's proposed open pit, boasts a rich history of producing high-grade copper, gold, silver, zinc, and tungsten.\nSince 2017,\u00a0Phoenix\u00a0has executed extensive drilling initiatives, resulting in an expansion of the Empire Open-Pit resource by over 200%. In\u00a0May 2024\u00a0the Company published its inaugural mineral reserve statement for the\u00a0Empire Open-Pit Mine. Proven and Probable mineral reserves are 10.1 million tonnes containing 109,487,970 lbs of copper, 104,000 oz of gold and 4,654,400 oz of silver. This reserve was estimated using assay data from 485 drill holes, extensive geological modelling, metallurgical recovery test work, geotechnical evaluation, and mine design. The reserve represents a combined 66,467 tonnes of copper equivalent metal.\nIn addition to the\u00a0Empire Mine,\u00a0Phoenix's\u00a0holdings in the district also encompass the Horseshoe, White Knob, and Blue\u00a0Bird Mines, all of which have been producers of copper, gold, silver, zinc, lead, and tungsten from underground operations, a new high-grade silver and lead orebody at\u00a0Red Star, and the\u00a0Navarre Creek\u00a0gold exploration project, which was first drilled in 2023. The Company's land package at Empire spans 8,434 acres (34 sq km).\nPhoenix\u00a0also owns two cobalt properties situated along the Idaho Cobalt Belt to the north of Empire. An Earn-In Agreement has been established concerning one of these properties.\nPhoenix\u00a0is listed on\u00a0London's\u00a0AIM (PXC), and trades on\u00a0New York's\u00a0OTCQX Market (PXCLF and PXCLY (ADRs)).
