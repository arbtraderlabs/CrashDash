The Company is also pleased to confirm the effect of increased metal prices on its 2024 Empire open-pit pre-feasibility study (\"PFS\") economic model.\nPartial Conversion of CLN\nFurther to the announcement on 4 December 2025, the Company confirms that the CLN holder, Indigo, has converted $536,000 at 1.483 pence per share into 26,981,814 new ordinary shares of no par value in the Company (\"New Ordinary Shares\").\nApplication has been made for the New Ordinary Shares to be admitted to trading on AIM (\"Admission\"). It is expected that Admission will become effective and dealings will commence at 8:00 am on or around 26 January 2026.\nThe Company has been informed that Indigo has entered into agreements to divest 24,181,814 of the New Ordinary Shares to various equity funds and family offices in Europe and elsewhere, as soon as practicable following Admission.\nTotal Voting Rights\nFollowing Admission, the Company will have 287,995,114 ordinary shares outstanding. Shareholders may use this number as the denominator for the calculation by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change in their interest in, the issued share capital of the Company.\nPotential Impact of Current Metal Prices on the 2024 Economic Model\nThe 2024 open-pit PFS economic model (the \"2024 Model\") was generated at the time using conservative, near-term trailing average metal prices of $4.45 / lb copper price, a $2,325 / oz gold price and a $27.25 / oz silver price. In order to illustrate the potential impact of current metal prices on the economics of the open pit, the Company has applied the following metal pricing to the 2024 Model; $5.58 / lb copper, $4,338 / oz gold and $70.73 / oz silver. Should these metal prices be maintained, the impact would be significant and would result in cumulative pre-tax net (after repaying estimated pre-production capital costs) cashflow of $405.80 million over the 8.5 year life of mine, as well as a 7.5% pre-tax Net Present Value (\"NPV\") of $252.11 million and a pre-tax Internal Rate of Return of 98.4%.\nA comparison of the impact to the 2024 Model is summarised in the table below:\nProject Evaluation Overview\n2024 PFS Before Tax / After Tax\n2026 Before Tax / After Tax\n% Change\nCumulative Net Cashflow (millions)\n$152.98 / $132.44\n$405.80 / $350.89\n165.3 / 164.9% Increase\nNPV @ 5.0% (millions)\n$105.44 / $89.55\n$293.85 / $252.34\n178.7 / 181.8% Increase\nNPV @ 7.5% (millions)\n$87.86 / $73.75\n$252.11 / $215.67\n186.9 / 192.4% Increase\nNPV @ 10.0% (millions)\n$73.29 / $60.71\n$217.34 / $185.17\n196.5 / 205% Increase\nInternal Rate of Return\n46.4% / 40.2%\n98.4% / 86.6%\n52 / 46.4% Increase\nThe 2026 Before Tax / After Tax results presented above have been internally estimated by the Company and have not been verified by the Company's independent technical consultants or Qualified Person. The results of this comparison are illustrative only and are not intended to imply a change in the Empire open pit mineral reserve nor are they intended to imply a new or updated Empire open pit economic model.\nThe Company also refers to its ongoing discussions with the US based bond investor (the \"Investor\"), first announced on 12 June 2025. These discussions have taken longer than initially anticipated due to other transactions the Investor has been completing. Although there can be no certainty a definitive agreement will be reached with the Investor, the Directors look forward to finalising the discussions and progressing towards completion.

Copper is now trading at $4.60/lb, compared with our cash cost of production of $2.44/lb. Few of you will need reminding of the paucity of our current market capitalisation, which is a fraction of the funding we are seeking in order to complete construction of the Empire open-pit mine. Despite this, negotiations to place additional corporate copper bonds to raise the necessary finance appear to be nearing completion, following which we can firmly focus on achieving first production at Empire.\nAs our CEO will allude to in his statement, copper fundamentals have strengthened significantly over the summer and are not so dependent on the Chinese construction industry. Recent announcements from the US regarding AI investment in the UK, for example, were genuinely surprising to many observers, both in terms of size and the fact that they are actually happening.\nMany analysts are forecasting the copper price to rise to $13,000/tonne, which would add over $280 million to our open-pit bottom line on copper alone, without blending in any of the higher-grade underground ore, which we hope to be able to do once we have driven our proposed adit towards the known high-grade sulphide mineralisation.\nSome commentators are also forecasting gold to increase to $5,000/oz. If this proves to be correct, that would add a further $100 million to the bottom line, with an additional $40 million for silver if the ratio to gold remains constant.\nFor the moment, as evidenced by the Anglo/Teck merger, mining companies still prefer to buy each other, rather than spend money on new projects, although this may be changing. Nevertheless, we expect to be in production long before the likes of Resolution start their operations.\nI would like to re-emphasise that the Empire open-pit project is the first of several strings to our bow: apart from the underground copper sulphides, the Red Star silver project, the Navarre Creek gold prospect, along with the White Knob and Windy Devil mineralised districts, all await funding amidst improving market sentiment. I thank you all for your continued patience.\nMarcus Edwards-Jones\nExecutive Chairman\n29 September 2025\nCHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S REPORT\nAs we finalize funding for the completion of detailed engineering, permitting, and construction of the Empire Open-Pit, the operations team spent the summer sorting the last of the project data that will be required by our consulting team to compile the final engineering document and roll that data into a revised Plan of Operations. The team has also completed the required 2025 reclamation work in the Navarre Creek area and hope for a long, cool autumn to fur",

The historic Empire underground mine, located beneath the surface of the Company's proposed open pit, boasts a rich history of producing high-grade copper, gold, silver, zinc, and tungsten.\nSince 2017, Phoenix has executed extensive drilling initiatives, resulting in an expansion of the Empire Open-Pit resource by over 200%. In May 2024 the Company published its inaugural mineral reserve statement for the Empire Open-Pit Mine. Proven and Probable mineral reserves are 10.1 million tonnes containing 109,487,970 lbs of copper, 104,000 oz of gold and 4,654,400 oz of silver. This reserve was estimated using assay data from 485 drill holes, extensive geological modelling, metallurgical recovery test work, geotechnical evaluation, and mine design. The reserve represents a combined 66,467 tonnes of copper equivalent metal.\nIn addition to the Empire Mine, Phoenix's holdings in the district also encompass the Horseshoe, White Knob, and Blue Bird Mines, all of which have been producers of copper, gold, silver, zinc, lead, and tungsten from underground operations, a new high-grade silver and lead orebody at Red Star, and the Navarre Creek gold exploration project, which was first drilled in 2023. The Company's land package at Empire spans 8,434 acres (34 sq km).\nPhoenix also owns two cobalt properties situated along the Idaho Cobalt Belt to the north of Empire. An Earn-In Agreement has been established concerning one of these properties.\nPhoenix is listed on London's AIM (PXC), and trades on New York's OTCQX Market (PXCLF and PXCLY (ADRs)).

We have been hoping for some time that the US would react to the fact that around 45% of its annual refined copper consumption is imported. We are therefore very encouraged that the Trump Administration has decided to address this issue and take steps to increase domestic production of critical minerals, and copper in particular.\nAt the time of writing, our main basket of metals is trading at or close to historically high prices. As mentioned before, due to Covid and the Ukraine war's disruptions, we took the opportunity to redraft the Pre-Feasibility Study (''PFS'') for our Empire open-pit copper, gold and silver project in Idaho USA, streamlining it into a more compact and efficient process. The PFS that we published in September 2024 has been worth the wait, generating net (after repaying capex) pre-tax cashflow of $153 million over an 8-year mine life, using $4.45/lb copper, $2,325/oz gold and $27.25/oz silver. This compares with initial capital expenditure of $62.6 million, and also produces a 5% Net Present Value ('NPV') of $105 million and Internal Rate of Return ('IRR') of 46%. If we adjust the precious metal prices to current ($3,350/oz gold and $34.50/oz silver), the net pre-tax cashflow increases to $204 million, the NPV to $143 million and the IRR to 57%.\nThis is no mean achievement. The copper equivalent grade of 0.66% is higher than the global \"in p",

The historic Empire underground mine, located beneath the surface of the Company's proposed open pit, boasts a rich history of producing high-grade copper, gold, silver, zinc, and tungsten.\nSince 2017,\u00a0Phoenix\u00a0has executed extensive drilling initiatives, resulting in an expansion of the Empire Open-Pit resource by over 200%. In\u00a0May 2024\u00a0the Company published its inaugural mineral reserve statement for the\u00a0Empire Open-Pit Mine. Proven and Probable mineral reserves are 10.1 million tonnes containing 109,487,970 lbs of copper, 104,000 oz of gold and 4,654,400 oz of silver. This reserve was estimated using assay data from 485 drill holes, extensive geological modelling, metallurgical recovery test work, geotechnical evaluation, and mine design. The reserve represents a combined 66,467 tonnes of copper equivalent metal.\nIn addition to the\u00a0Empire Mine,\u00a0Phoenix's\u00a0holdings in the district also encompass the Horseshoe, White Knob, and Blue\u00a0Bird Mines, all of which have been producers of copper, gold, silver, zinc, lead, and tungsten from underground operations, a new high-grade silver and lead orebody at\u00a0Red Star, and the\u00a0Navarre Creek\u00a0gold exploration project, which was first drilled in 2023. The Company's land package at Empire spans 8,434 acres (34 sq km).\nPhoenix\u00a0also owns two cobalt properties situated along the Idaho Cobalt Belt to the north of Empire. An Earn-In Agreement has been established concerning one of these properties.\nPhoenix\u00a0is listed on\u00a0London's\u00a0AIM (PXC), and trades on\u00a0New York's\u00a0OTCQX Market (PXCLF and PXCLY (ADRs)).

Phoenix expects the Bonds to be drawn down in three tranches: $30 million on execution of the legal documentation (the \"First Tranche\"), followed by two further tranches of amounts and on dates to be mutually agreed between Phoenix and the Investor (the \"Bonds Drawdown\") in due course.\nThe LOI also provides for the issue to the Investor of a preference share of no par value convertible at \u00a30.05 per share into 25 million new ordinary shares of no par value, currently representing approximately 10.5% of the enlarged outstanding share capital of the Company, at any time between 1 September 2025 and 30 June 2028. The conversion rights will vest pro-rata to the Bonds Drawdown.\nThe Investor will also be allocated one board seat on the Company's Board, following payment of the First Tranche. The appointment of any director will be subject to the usual suitability assessment and other criteria.\nAlthough the Directors are confident that any remaining due diligence will be completed in a timely manner and that the definitive legal documentation will be executed, there can be no certainty that the Bonds will be placed with the Investor. The Company looks forward to providing shareholders with further updates as appropriate.\nRichard Wilkins, Chief Financial Officer of Phoenix, commented:\n\"We have been in discussions with the Investor for a number of months, and we look forward to completing the appropriate legal documentation and welcoming the Investor on board as both a Bondholder and, through the proposed conversion of the preference share, a shareholder.\n\"This proposed placement of Bonds will provide the Company with the cash resources to complete construction of the Empire open-pit copper, gold and silver mine in Idaho, USA and proceed into production, as well as commencing an underground drilling programme on the Empire sulphide vein system, by way of driving an initial adit to the known high-grade (8.38% copper) zone.\"\nPartial conversion of short-term loan\nThe Company also reports that its short-term loan provider\n[1]\nhas converted $176,585 of outstanding principal into 4,853,208 new ordinary shares in the Company (the \"New Ordinary Shares\") at a price of 2.82 pence per ordinary share (the \"Partial Loan Conversion\").\nApplication has been made for the New Ordinary Shares, which rank\npari passu\nwith the existing ordinary shares of no par value (\"Ordinary Shares\") in issue, to be admitted to trading on AIM (\"Admission\"). It is expected that Admission will become effective and dealings will occur at 8:00am UK time on or around 18 June 2025.\nFollowing the Partial Loan Conversion, the Company has 212,037,300 Ordinary Shares outstanding. Shareholders may use this number as the denominator for the calculation by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the issued share capital of the Company.\nMarket Abuse Regulation (MAR) Disclosure\nThe Company deems the information contained within this announcement to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014, which has been incorporated into\u00a0UK\u00a0law by the\u00a0European Union\u00a0(Withdrawal) Act 2018.

The historic Empire underground mine, located beneath the surface of the Company's proposed open pit, boasts a rich history of producing high-grade copper, gold, silver, zinc, and tungsten.\nSince 2017,\u00a0Phoenix\u00a0has executed extensive drilling initiatives, resulting in an expansion of the Empire Open-Pit resource by over 200%. In\u00a0May 2024\u00a0the Company published its inaugural mineral reserve statement for the Empire Open-Pit Mine. Proven and Probable mineral reserves are 10.1 million tonnes containing 109,487,970 lbs of copper, 104,000 oz of gold and 4,654,400 oz of silver. This reserve was estimated using assay data from 485 drill holes, extensive geological modelling, metallurgical recovery test work, geotechnical evaluation, and mine design. The reserve represents a combined 66,467 tonnes of copper equivalent metal.\nIn addition to the\u00a0Empire Mine,\u00a0Phoenix's\u00a0holdings in the district also encompass the Horseshoe, White Knob, and Blue\u00a0Bird Mines, all of which have been producers of copper, gold, silver, zinc, lead, and tungsten from underground operations, a new high-grade silver and lead orebody at\u00a0Red Star, and the\u00a0Navarre Creek\u00a0gold exploration project, which was first drilled in 2023. The Company's land package at Empire spans 8,434 acres (34 sq km).\nPhoenix\u00a0also owns two cobalt properties situated along the Idaho Cobalt Belt to the north of Empire. An Earn-In Agreement has been established concerning one of these properties.\nPhoenix\u00a0is listed on\u00a0London's\u00a0",

In total, 3,775,000 Warrants and 6,225,000 Options have lapsed. The Options were all held by directors, advisory board members and senior employees of the Company.\nFollowing the lapse of the Warrants and Options, the issue of the New Ordinary Shares and the exercise of warrants between the period 11 October 2024 and 7 April 2025 following the Block Listing update announced on 7 October 2024, the Company will have 207,184,092 ordinary shares in issue. 15,210,443 vested warrants outstanding, and no options outstanding. Shareholders may use the number of outstanding ordinary shares as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change to their interest in, the issued share capital of the Company. The Company's fully diluted share capital remains unaffected.\nApplication for Admission\nApplication has been made for the New Ordinary Shares, which rank\npari passu\nwith the existing ordinary shares in issue, to be admitted to trading on AIM (\"Admission\"). It is expected that Admission will become effective and dealings will occur at 8:00am UK time on or around 10 April 2025.\nFinancing Update\nFollowing the Subscription, the Company will continue to operate with minimal corporate overheads to ensure that it has sufficient working capital to allow it to conclude discussions with interested parties in the US and elsewhere regarding the issue of additional corporate copper bonds, to finance the ongoing construction of the Empire Mine.\nAlthough there can be no certainty, the Directors remain confident that additional copper bonds will be placed and the Company looks forward to providing shareholders with further updates as appropriate.\nOperations Update\nThe Company welcomes the new White House Administration's focus on prioritising US domestic mineral production generally, and copper in particular. The detailed engineering work for the Empire copper-gold-silver open pit mine in Idaho, USA (the \"Empire Mine\") is nearing completion, allowing the Plan of Operations for final permitting to be updated with the new crush-grind-flotation circuit. With the processing plant as well as the open-pit now being situated on private (patented) land, the permitting process should be significantly simplified, and the Company looks forward to providing shareholders with further updates as it works towards becoming one of the first new copper mines to contribute towards increased US mineral production.\nMarket Abuse Regulation (MAR) Disclosure\nThe Company deems the information contained within this announcement to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014, which has been incorporated into\u00a0UK\u00a0law by the\u00a0European Union\u00a0(Withdrawal) Act 2018.

(\"Konnex\") (the \"2015 Agreement\").\nPhoenix owns 80% of Konnex, the Idaho registered corporate vehicle that owns and is developing the Empire Open-Pit Project in Custer County, Idaho, USA, to produce copper, gold and silver (the \"Project\"), via its wholly owned subsidiary, KPX Holdings Inc (\"KPXH\"). ExGen owns the remaining 20% of Konnex.\nFollowing recent discussions, Phoenix, ExGen, Konnex and KPXH have signed a further amendment to the 2015 Agreement to include a carried interest arrangement, which simplifies the obligations of Phoenix and ExGen in relation to the Project (the \"2024 Amendment\"). Under the 2024 Amendment:\n\u00b7\nPhoenix will no longer be required to make an annual payment to ExGen, or meet a minimum required annual spend on the Project;\n\u00b7\nPhoenix will no longer need to provide ExGen with a bankable feasibility study before requiring ExGen to fund 20% of the Project's construction costs; and\n\u00b7\nPhoenix intends to fund ExGen's contribution to the Project's construction costs through a shareholder loan, which will be provided directly to Konnex. It is intended that the loan, plus interest, will be repaid to Phoenix from ExGen's share of the Project's future cash flows. Further details of this shareholder loan, including quantum and key terms, will be announced once agreed between the parties and funding has been finalised by Phoenix.\nIn addition, Phoenix will retain its Honolulu royalty and mining claims and Mackay royalty, as acquired and announced on 27 October 2021. Any further royalties or mining claims that are acquired in the future, by either Phoenix or KPXH, will be offered for transfer to Konnex in accordance with the terms of the 2015 Agreement and this 2024 Amendment.\nRyan McDermott, Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"I am pleased to have reached an agreement with our partners at ExGen that significantly simplifies our relationship, and enables the construction of the Empire Open-Pit to be funded by one co-ordinated shareholder loan managed by Phoenix, rather than two shareholder loans on potentially different terms. Both parties look forward to working together to bring the Project into profitable production as soon as possible and I look forward to providing our shareholders with further updates in due course.\"\nRelated Party Transaction\nKonnex is a subsidiary of the Company and the Executive Directors of Phoenix and Jason Riley are also Directors of Konnex. Jason Riley is also CEO of ExGen. As such, the 2024 Amendment constitutes a related party transaction for the purposes of AIM Rule 13.\nCatherine Evans, a Non-Executive Director of Phoenix who is deemed independent for the purposes of AIM Rule 13, considers having consulted with SP Angel Corporate Finance LLP, the Company's nominated adviser, that the 2024 Amendment is fair and reasonable in so far as the Company's shareholders are concerned.\nMarket Abuse Regulation (MAR) Disclosure\nThe Company deems the information contained within this announcement to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014, which has been incorporated into\u00a0UK\u00a0law by the\u00a0European Union\u00a0(Withdrawal) Act 2018. Upon the publication of this announcement via the\u00a0Regulatory Information Service, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\n\u200bEnvironmental, Social, and Corporate Governance\nPhoenix\u00a0is committed to meeting and exceeding the environmental standards required by law as a core value of the Company. The baseline environmental data collected to date will be used to further the permitting process, but as importantly, will be used as the building blocks for the Company's ongoing Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (\"ESG\") platform, overseen by the Company's\u00a0ESG & Sustainability Committee.\nFor further information please visit\nhttps://phoenixcopperlimited.com\n.\nPhoenix Copper Limited\nRyan McDermott\nPaul de Gruchy\nRichard Wilkins\nTel: +1 208 9547039\nTel: +44 7484 203 720\nTel: +44 7590 216 657\nSP Angel Corporate Finance LLP\u00a0(Nominated Adviser)\nDavid Hignell\u00a0/\u00a0Caroline Rowe\u00a0/\u00a0Devik Mehta\nTel: +44 20 3470 0470\nTavira Financial Limited\u00a0(Joint Broker)\nJonathan Evans\u00a0/\u00a0Oliver Stansfield\nTel: +44 20 7100 5100\nZeus Capital Limited\u00a0(Joint Broker)\nHarry Ansell\u00a0/\u00a0Katy Mitchell\nTel: +44 20 7220 1666\nPanmure Liberum (UK) Limited\u00a0(Joint Broker)\nMark Murphy\u00a0/\u00a0Kieron Hodgson\nTel: +44 20 7886 2500\nEAS Advisors\u00a0(US Corporate Adv",

The metal prices used by our independent consultants are lower than prevailing spot prices for copper, gold and silver. The PFS generates an internal rate of return (\"IRR\") of 46.4% which is significantly higher than the 15% hurdle rate used by mining majors, and our projected cash cost of production of $2.44 per lb of copper would rank us 199th out of the 300 major copper mines in the S & P rankings for 2024 - with cash costs well below several larger and well-established mines in North America.\nIt is to the technical team's credit that they were able to redesign the mine plan to take into account the challenges presented by the steep rises in capital and operating costs. Our plant will process copper, gold and silver at the same time, and without the need for copper ore to sit on leach pads for 90 days. The plant will also be sited next to the open pit, significantly reducing transport costs and the environmental impact of the project.\nImportantly, the plant will also be capable of processing both oxide and sulphide ores. As a result, and resources permitting, we now plan to access the underground deposit as early as next year by driving an adit into the high-grade sulphide ores, in order to blend them with oxide ore to enhance cashflow. In our recent drilling campaign we recovered sulphide core containing over 8% copper, compared with a 0.66% grade in our oxide reserves, and a global average of less than 0.5%.\nOur records show that before the Empire mine closed in 1942, they were mining 6% to 8% copper and recovering 3.64%, as well as gol",

The flotation circuit will also be suitable for processing future polymetallic sulphide vein material from below the open pit. The PFS shows Life-of-Mine production (payable) of 89,094,705 copper lbs (40,424 mt), 40,161 oz gold, and 1,759,717 oz silver . The estimated operating and capital costs for the design mill, the open pit, and ancillary operations are included in the PFS, which shows a pre-tax NPV7.5 of US$87.86 million, a 46.4% IRR, and US$152.98 million cumulative net free cashflow over an 8-year open pit mine life. It is important to note that the footprint of the processing facility will allow it to be situated nearer to the open pit on patented mining claims, hopefully simplifying the plan of operations and the permitting process in general.\n\"The Empire processing mill will produce a copper-gold-silver concentrate in the flotation circuit and a separate cement copper stream from the leaching circuit. As the flotation circuit will also be able to process sulphide ore, the Empire team is currently finalizing a plan to advance the exploration of the deeper sulphide vein system with an eye on augmenting the open pit ore with feed from the higher-grade sulphide vein system below the pit. The planning includes driving an adit toward known sulphide mineralization and developing underground drilling stations along the length of the adit. Known sulphide mineralization includes the 8.38% copper interval intercepted in the 2021 core drilling program, which also assayed 1.31 grammes per tonne (\"g/t\") gold and 120 g/t silver. Historically mined grades from the sulphide vein system below the open pit were recorded as high as 8% copper, with smelter recoveries of the time recorded as averaging 3.64% copper, 1.64 g/t gold, and 54 g/t silver. The advantage to underground mining and drilling is that it can be conducted effectively in the wintertime without significant weather-related impacts. Resources permitting, we hope to commence driving the adit this winter.\n\"Using this PFS as the basis, we are now completing final detailed engineering and the plan of operations for the open-pit mine. The Phoenix team will continue to refine and optimize the operating and capital costing parameters of the mine and processing facility, with the intent to further reduce those costs where possible. Assuming we can augment the open-pit ore with high grade sulphide material, this should further improve the Project economics.\n\"I would also like to report that the pre-owned ball mills purchased by the Company in March 2024 have been delivered to our facility in Idaho. Additional rolling stock and some fixed assets have been purchased, all pre-owned, and are also at the Idaho facility. As we have previously reported, it is the Company's intention to outfit the Empire Mine and milling operation with used and pre-owned equipment to decrease the overall capex. The estimated capex in the PFS for the Empire Mine is currently estimated at US$62.6 million.\n\"The PFS was prepared using the NI 43-101 format, but is not considered NI 43-101 compliant because used and pre-owned equipment pricing was used to calculate capital expenditures. The Company is well",

We believe Electra is well-positioned to further advance the Redcastle property's potential, and we look forward to working with the Electra team as that potential is realized.\"\nPhoenix's Redcastle claim block is located in Lemhi County, situated within the southern region of the Idaho Cobalt Belt, approximately 110 miles north of the Empire Open-Pit Mine Project. Covering 600 acres of unpatented mining claims, the claims block shares a border with Electra Battery Material's Iron Creek property. At present, the Iron Creek Mine hosts Indicated cobalt and copper Mineral Resources totaling 4.5 million tonnes, with cobalt grading at 0.19% for 18.4 million pounds and copper grading at 0.73% for 71.5 million pounds. Additionally, Inferred copper and cobalt Mineral Resources stand at 1.2 million tonnes, with cobalt at 0.08% for 2.1 million pounds and copper at 1.34% for 36.5 million pounds.\nElectra Battery Materials, listed on both TSX and NASDAQ with a market capitalisation of approximately US$25.6 million, has conducted drilling activities at Iron Creek since 2018, utilising both surface and underground approaches. With their established expertise, workforce, and local infrastructure, they are well-suited to lead exploration efforts at our adjacent Redcastle property. This agreement facilitates the advancement of Redcastle's development at no expense to Phoenix, allowing us to focus on our primary endeavour, the Empire Mine in Custer County.\nTrent Mell,\nFirst Cobalt Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"Extending this agreement preserves the opportunity to advance the potential of the Redcastle site, and we are in the process updating our exploration permit, allowing us to explore for up to 10 years beginning in 2025. Although Electra's primary focus remains completing our cobalt refinery project in Ontario, given the potential for the Idaho Cobalt Belt to be an important source of critical minerals needed for North America's developing EV battery supply chain, we look forward to re-launching field exploration work and exploration drilling programs and continuing our collaboration with Phoenix.\"\nRedcastle and Iron Creek Cobalt -\u00a0Lemhi County, Idaho\nThe Redcastle property is located in the southern half of the Idaho Cobalt Belt in\u00a0Lemhi County\u00a0approximately 110 miles north of the\u00a0Empire Mine. The property consists of 600-acres of unpatented mining claims situated due east, and sharing a common border with, Electra's Iron Creek Cobalt Project.\nElectra's Idaho properties consist of mining patents and exploration claims over an area of 73.15 km2, including the Iron Creek Project, and cover the strike extent of strata hosting the cobalt-copper sulphide mineralisation. Iron Creek is one of several cobalt-copper resources and prospects within the Idaho Cobalt Belt, a prospective mineralised system that contains the largest primary cobalt resources in the United States, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Historical underground development at Iron Creek includes 600 metres of underground drifting from three adits. In March 2023, Electra released an updated Mineral Resources Estima",

The historic Empire underground mine, located beneath the surface of the Company's proposed open pit, boasts a rich history of producing high-grade copper, gold, silver, zinc, and tungsten.\nSince 2017, Phoenix has executed extensive drilling initiatives, resulting in the estimation of mineral reserves.\nThe Proven and Probable reserves at Empire are 10.1 million tonnes containing 109,487,970 lbs of copper, 104,000 ounces of gold, and 4,654,400 ounces of silver, equating to 66,467 copper equivalent tonnes.\nIn addition to the Empire Mine, Phoenix's holdings in the district also encompass the Horseshoe, White Knob, and Blue Bird Mines, all of which have been producers of copper, gold, silver, zinc, lead, and tungsten from underground operations, a new high-grade silver and lead orebody at Red Star, and the Navarre Creek gold exploration project, which was first drilled in 2023. The Company's land package at Empire spans 8,434 acres (34.13 sq km).\nPhoenix also owns two cobalt properties situated along the Idaho Cobalt Belt to the north of Empire. An Earn-In Agreement has been established concerning one of these properties.\nPhoenix\u00a0is listed on\u00a0London's\u00a0AIM (PXC), and trades on\u00a0the New York\u00a0OTCQX Market (PXCLF and PXCLY (ADRs)).

Navarre Creek is a vast exploration zone, multiple times larger than the Empire Mine open-pit area. We initially selected four target areas, and it is very encouraging to note that two of those areas have returned mineralization of significance, worthy of further follow-up.\n\"Holes NC23-01 through NC23-07 were drilled to test Target Area 1 on the southwest end of the claim block specifically targeting the mineralized Lehman Creek fault Holes. NC23-08 through NC23-11 were drilled in Target Area 2, 4.77 kilometers northeast of Target Area 1. Target Area 2 tested a surface geochemical anomaly identified during previous field mapping and surface sampling in 2020. Target Area 3, holes NC23-12 - NC23-18, tested a gold-antimony geochemical anomaly identified during field mapping, and Target Area 4, holes NC23-19 - NC23-28, tested a jasperoid exposure identified during field mapping.\n\"I am pleased to report that all seven of the Target Area 1 holes encountered a continuous zone/band of low-grade gold mineralization. Each of the drill holes NC23-01 to NC23-07 were angled and drilled perpendicular to the strike of the Lehman Creek fault and cross dip. The seven holes were widely spaced at various angles along 580 meters of the fault. The mineralized zone was encountered between 19.2 meters and 44.2 meters true vertical depth along strike, indicating that the zone is open along strike and down-dip. The mineralized zone is clearly defined geochemically, and the consistency along the strike is important in that it demonstrates the fault as a conduit for gold-bearing fluids and at least one volcanic unit in the hanging-wall as a suitable host for mineralization. The drilling results are representative of a relatively shallow, near-surface portion of the mineralized system. I am very much looking forward to further testing down-dip and further along strike. The initial drilling results in Target Area 1 were considered significant enough that we expanded the Navarre Creek claim block to the southwest by an additional 400 acres, bringing the total claim block size to 3,977 acres (\n16.09 km\u00b2)\n.\n\"The assay results from the four drill holes NC23-13 through NC23-16, which targeted an area with a gold-antimony surface anomaly identified during field work, returned anomalous low-grade silver and silver-antimony. 1.5 meters of 1.10% (10,100 parts per million ('ppm')) antimony was present at a depth of 4.6 meters. Antimony can be an important trace element in mineralized systems as it can be associated with precious metals. While the four drill holes tested a relatively small area, we now have a better understanding of the subsurface geology and mineral potential in that specific area. The remainder of the 28 drill holes showed little to no significant gold mineralization.\n\"The Navarre Creek project covers nearly 4,000-acres. As we have reported in the past, surficial evidence of mineralization is widespread and pervasive. While the overall gold assay grades were low, the presence, location, depth, and host lithology of the mineralization is important and will be used as a tool for further stages of exploration. The activities at Navarre Creek are very much grassroots, very early-stage exploration, not development drilling, and we are satisfied to initially encounter this low-grade mineralization early in the program as we continue to develop an understanding of the dynamics of the system and explore for more substantial quantities of mineralization.\n\"Given the latest bond funding news, we are clearly focusing our resources on the deve",

Despite several delays and disappointments, we are hopeful that our stars are finally aligning. Uncertainties over the Chinese and US economies meant that it took longer for the drivers of electrification and supply issues to reassert their influences on the copper price. It now looks as if the penny has finally dropped. Several new catalysts have appeared since my last statement, including the astonishing \"own goal\" closure of First Quantum's Cobre Panama mine, which has removed approximately 350,000 tonnes per annum or 1.5% of global mined copper production from the market; and the rapid rise of the AI sector. Commodity leviathan Trafigura estimates that AI and data centre demand alone could add a further 1 million tonnes per annum to overall copper demand by 2030 and forecast a 35% supply gap by the end of the decade.\nThis is against a background of the long-term decline in copper grades at existing mines, and several disappointments on the supply side. Previous misdemeanours by the mining sector have ushered in an era in which the ESG lobbies and NGOs have so lengthened the time it takes to put a new mine into production that many companies and investors have given up funding new projects. Antofagasta and Twin Metals invested several hundred million dollars in the Maturi project in Minnesota, which did not receive a mining permit. Similarly, the Pebble deposit in Alaska, one of the largest polymetallic deposits on the planet, on which exploration work commenced in 1987, containing over 30 million tonnes of copper, is unlikely ever to receive permission to mine. As the BHP Group bid for Anglo American Plc shows, it is more expedient to expand your copper reserves by buying somebody else's, rather than developing your own. As in politics, investment decisions, however beneficial in the long term, are seldom taken by people who may not be around to see the rewards, yet suffer if there are any delays in execution. This all points to a \"higher for longer\" scenario for the copper price which the Board anticipates will be responsible for some 70% of the Company's predicted revenues from the Empire open pit mine in Idaho, USA, a State with a proven and ongoing reputation for permi",

The Proven and Probable reserves at Empire are 10.1 million tonnes containing 109,487,970 lbs of copper, 104,000 ounces of gold, and 4,654,400 ounces of silver, which equates to 66,467 copper equivalent tonnes.\n\"This reserve calculation upgrades our mineral resources into mineral reserves that represent the economically mineable portion of the mineral resources. The reported reserves are the result of years of exploration, drilling, and metallurgical testing, followed by meticulous engineering evaluation and analysis. It was estimated using assay data from 485 drill holes, extensive geological modelling, metallurgical recovery test work, geotechnical evaluation, and mine design.\n\"Mineral reserves meet the requirements of geological certainty, accessibility, and economic viability, and are estimated after allowing for mining and processing dilution, and thus represent the recoverable contained metal that is expected to be delivered to the smelter for refining into saleable product to generate revenue.\n\"I want to thank our team for their tireless hours of work and their dedication to our Idaho project. I look forward to sharing additional updates regarding the Empire open pit development in due course.\"\nMineral Reserve Statement for Empire Mine\nFully diluted tonnes @ a Net Smelter Return cut-off of $22.59/tonne\nClassification\nTonnes\nCopper\nGold\nSilver\nCopper Equiv.\n(x1000)\n%\nlb (x1000)\ngpt\noz (x1000)\ngpt\noz (x1000)\n%\nlbs (x1000)\ntonnes\nProven\n7,515\n0.49\n81,070.56\n0.38\n90.9\n14.42\n3,483.70\n0.68\n111,995.19\n50,814\nProbable\n2,582\n0.5\n28,417.41\n0.16\n13.2\n14.1\n1,170.70\n0.61\n34,498.69\n15,652\nProven + Probable\n10,097\n0.49\n109,487.97\n0.32\n104\n14.34\n4,654.40\n0.66\n146,493.89\n66,467\nThe mineral reserves reported herein for the Empire project have been estimated in a manner consistent with the NI 43-101 Committee of Mineral Reserves International Reporting Standards (\"CRIRSCO\") of which both the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (\"CIM\") and Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (the \"JORC Code\") are members.\nThe mineral reserves presented herein are an integral part of the Company's ongoing pre-feasibility studies and will be reported in a NI43-101 PFS in due course.\nMineral Reserves Defined\nMineral reserves are defined as that portion of a mineral resource that can be realistically and economically mined. A mineral reserve must be proven by a detailed evaluation programme and meet\nstringent requirements of geological certainty, accessibility, and economic viability, proving\nthat a deposit is of sufficient quantity and quality to be defined as a viable, economically mineable reserve.\nA mineral reserve will typically include allowances for losses (dilution) that may occur during the extraction process as defined by feasibility engineering studies. To attain the distinction of being a \"reserve,\" this resource must also be fully evaluated and deemed commercially viable to work.\nMineral reserves are typically defined as probable or proven reserves. Proven reserves are reserves where the spatial information of the reserve, including size, shape, and depth, as well as mineral content of the reserves are well-established. Probable reserves have some of the same qualities of a Proven reserve, but may have sites for inspection, sampling, or measurement that are farther apart or otherwise less adequately spaced, which makes the data less reliable than for Proven reserves.\nBy comparison, mineral resources are defined as Measured and Indicated and are not necessarily economically mineable. A mineral reserve is extracted from the mineral resource and represents the economically mineable portion of a Measured and Indicated resource.\nQualified Person\nThe foregoing technical information in this news release\nhas been reviewed and verified by\u00a0Dennis Thomas, ACSM, FIMMM, FGS, CEng, Eurlng, co-founder of\u00a0Phoenix Copper Limited\u00a0and Member of the Company's\u00a0Advisory Board.

The original fundraise target was increased due to additional investor demand.\nIn addition to the Placing and Subscription, the Company is also providing retail investors with the opportunity to subscribe for an aggregate of up to 1,739,130 Retail Offer Shares at the Issue Price via the Bookbuild platform, to raise up to approximately \u00a30.2 million (before expenses). The Retail Offer is due to close at 4.35pm on or around 31 January 2024 and the results of the Retail Offer will be announced separately thereafter.\nThe Placing is subject to the conditions set out in the Launch Announcement.\nUse of Proceeds and working capital\nAs set out in the Launch Announcement, the net proceeds of the Fundraise will be used to progress the purchase of the Equipment (including taxes and shipping) and for general working capital purposes. In the unlikely event that the purchase of the Equipment does not complete, all funds will be applied for general working capital purposes and to progress the work at the Company's Empire Open Pit Mine in Idaho.\nIn addition to the Fundraise, and as previously announced on 5 January 2024, the Company remains in advanced discussions with a number of interested bond investors in relation to the Company's proposed corporate copper bond financing which is intended to finance construction of the Empire Open-Pit Mine in Idaho, USA (the \"Bond Financing\"). Furthermore, with respect to its $2 million short-term loan facility (the \"Facility\"), the lender has agreed to waive its conversion rights for one month from 25 January 2024, whilst the Company remains in negotiations with the lender to roll the Facility into a new and larger facility before the repayment date of 23 March 2024. The Directors remain confident that the Bond Financing will be closed and that the Facility will be rolled into a new and larger facility. At this stage, however, there can be no certainty that the Company will receive the Bond Financing or that the Facility will be rolled into a new facility.\nIn the event that the Bond Financing does not complete and a new facility is not put in place before 23 March 2024, the Company will be required to seek alternative sources of funding to fund the future working capital and capex requirements of the Company, and to repay the Facility.

From the 2020 PEA, the measured and indicated resource is 22,909,059 tonnes at an average grade of 0.38% copper, 0.324 grammes per tonne (\"g/t\") gold, 10.3 g/t silver, and 0.19% zinc. The contained metal for the measured and indicated resource is 87,543 tonnes of copper, 238,406 ounces of gold, 7,595,198 ounces of silver and 43,871 tonnes of zinc.\nIn addition to Empire, the district includes the historic Horseshoe, White Knob and Blue\u00a0Bird Mines, past producers of copper, gold, silver, zinc, lead and tungsten from underground mines. A new discovery at\u00a0Red Star, 330 metres northwest of the\u00a0Empire Mine\u00a0proposed open pit, has revealed high grade silver / lead sulphide ore, and from three shallow exploration drill holes a maiden inferred resource of 103,000 tonnes containing 173.4 g/t silver, 0.85 g/t gold and 3.85% lead (1.6 million ounces silver equivalent) was reported in an NI 43-101 technical report published in\u00a0May 2019. Additionally, the district includes\u00a0Navarre Creek, a volcanic hosted precious metals target in a 16.09 sq km area. The Company's total land package at Empire comprises 8,434 acres (34.13 sq kms).\nAt Empire, it is estimated that less than 1% of the potential ore system has been explored to date and, accordingly, there is significant opportunity to increase the resource through phased exploration. The stated aim of the Company is to fund this phased exploration through free cashflow generated by its initial mine. A Plan of Operations in respect of ",

The allotment and issue of the new Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Fundraise will be within the Company's existing share authorities granted at the Company's annual general meeting in June 2023.\n\u00b7\nCertain Directors of the Company and members of the Company's advisory board have indicated their intention to participate in the Fundraise, by way of a direct subscription with the Company.\n\u00b7\nThe Directors intend that net proceeds of the Fundraise will be used to fund the purchase of mining and processing equipment (as detailed below and subject to agreement of terms) at a substantial discount to new value, and for general working capital purposes. In the unlikely event that the purchase of the mining equipment does not progress, all the net proceeds will be used for general working capital purposes and to progress the work at the Company's Empire Open Pit Mine in Idaho.\n\u00b7\nIn addition to the Fundraise, and as previously announced on 5 January 2024, the Company remains in advanced discussions on its proposed corporate copper bond financing and remains in negotiations with the lender to roll the Company's existing short-term loan facility into a new and larger facility before the repayment date of 23 March 2024.\nDuring such discussions the lender has agreed to waive its conversion rights on the short-term loan facility for one month from 25 January 2024.\n\u00b7\nIn the event that the Bond Financing does not complete and a new facility is not put in place before 23 March 2024, the Company will be required to seek alternative sources of funding to fund the future working capital and capex requirements of the Company, and to repay the Facility.\nThe Fundraise\n, which is being undertaken whilst the Company continues to work towards completion of the Company's proposed corporate bond issue,\nwill comprise:\n\u00b7\na placing raising approximately \u00a31.2 million (the \"\nPlacing\n\") through the issue of new Ordinary Shares (the \"\nPlacing Shares\n\") at the Issue Price;\n\u00b7\na subscription of approximately \u00a31.0 million (the \"\nSubscription\n\") by certain Directors, advisory board members of the Company and certain other\ninvestors\nfor new Ordinary Shares (the \"\nSubscription Shares\n\"); and\n\u00b7\na retail offer of up to \u00a30.2 million to eligible existing retail Shareholders on the BookBuild Platform at the Issue Price (the \"\nRetail Offer\n\").

The PFS for the Empire Open-Pit Mine is nearing completion, and barring any unforeseen delays is anticipated for delivery to the Company by early Q2 2024. The final PFS report will include a comprehensive mine plan, mineral processing design, compliant mineral reserves calculated as deliverable metal for smelting or refining, net of mining dilution, detailed operating and capital cost estimates, and final economic analysis and cashflow. The completion of this report will represent a significant milestone for the Company and will enable us to make final amendments to the Plan of Operations for permitting purposes, and to commence procurement of certain relevant capital equipment items.\n\"The critical part of the Empire Open-Pit PFS process has been to test the viability of a variety of mining and processing options, optimize multiple options, and conduct numerous checks on laboratory and engineering findings to help ensure that we have maximum flexibility prior to moving forward with the final stages of development engineering. This PFS process has been \"result\" oriented. In these types of studies, the initial results and findings can often lead to further studies, all helping to ensure that the final plans are as robust as possible.\n\"The Company endeavors to meet the timelines it develops for itself and shareholders. It is of particular importance to me that everyone understands that the nature of the studies we undertake to ensure the best mining and production outcomes can be time-consuming and not always predictable. I appreciate everyone's patience as we complete each step of the PFS. Mining is a long-term, capital-intensive business, and we believe the time spent on optimizing the mine plan and processing design at this stage can bring significant financial benefits to the project over the life of the mine.\n\"I would also like to provide an update on the Navarre Creek gold exploration program. As we reported in October 2023, 400 acres of additional unpatented mining claims were staked contiguously to the southwest end of our existing claim block following our initial review of the results from the 2023 drilling program. Since that reporting, the Phoenix team has been focused entirely on the analysis and engineering required for the Empire PFS. However, our expanded land position at Navarre Creek affords us the time to further assess the exploration data and develop a strategy for the next phase of drilling to be conducted this year. We will report more information regarding Navarre Creek as soon as time allows.\"\nPre-Feasibility Study (PFS)\nThe Empire Open-Pit Mine PFS was commissioned in early 2023 and began with comprehensive metallurgical engineering studies, using metallurgical core obtained during the 2022 metallurgical drilling programme and assay results that became available from the laboratory in early 2023. In addition to metallurgy, the PFS will include a comprehensive analysis of geological models, mine design, mineral processing design, environmental assessment and analysis, estimation of operating and capital costs, and final economic analysis and cashflow modeling.\nProcess Design and Metallurgical Testing\nThe metallurgical test work and process design engineering completed to date as part of the PFS, indicates that oxide flotation + tank leach tails processing will provide the most optimal results.\nThe process design/metallurgical engineering team has completed preliminary test work on electrical load calculations, comminution testing, flotation concentrate smelter penalty analysis, variability testing, thickening testing, leach residue analysis, and cementation. Additional sample composites representing several mining phases are currently undergoing final laboratory testing. Additionally, laboratory checks and some final grinding studies, rougher/cleaner flotation testing, and leach tails analysis are in process in the laboratory and anticipated for completion during Q1 2024. The results of all of the work will be incorporated into the PFS.\nEnvironmental, Social, and Corporate Governance\nPhoenix\u00a0is committed to meeting and exceeding the environmental standards required by law as a core value of the Company.

We are currently assessing all of the results, so that we can put them into context with the geologic system as we currently understand it. However, gold values from the first target area, comprised of seven holes along the strike of the Lehman Creek fault, show a clearly defined low-grade gold bearing zone that is continuous across each drill hole. The zone appears to trend off the property to the southwest. As such, we have added 400-acres of unpatented mining claims to the claim block on the southwest to ensure control of the property while we finish our evaluation of the results. The results at the other target areas are presently under evaluation.\n\"In addition to the evaluation of the Navarre Creek drilling results and the additional claim staking, we are also in the process of updating the Empire mine open pit resource model to include last year's metallurgical drilling results, finalising metallurgical testing and completing an updated feasibility study for the open pit mine, as well as preparing for winter operations in the Idaho mountains.\n\"The Empire mine open pit process design and development is well underway, including the engineering evaluation of the footprint proposed as the site of the processing facility on the Company's patented land near the future open pit. The final process design is critical to the success of the mining operation as it is the step that ensures maximum metal recovery and maximum revenue. We are advancing through the engineering studies at a pace reasonable to maintain the integrity of the final design.\n\"We will release the results of the Navarre Creek exploratory drilling once they have been fully evaluated and placed in the context of the geologic system as a whole, to assist us to determine the drilling priorities for the remaining 32 holes within our planned 60 hole RC drilling program and application for additional drill permitting for the 2024 field season. I understand that everyone is keenly interested in our progress and I very much appreciate everyone's patience as we complete all of the work necessary to maximize the project's economic potential.\"\nBackground on Navarre Creek\nDuring the 2021 field season,\u00a0Phoenix\u00a0contracted Magee Geophysical Services to acquire approximately 169 line-km of total field magnetic measurements at the Company's\u00a0Navarre Creek\u00a0project and\u00a0SpecTIR, LLC\u00a0of\u00a0Reno, Nevada\u00a0to complete an airborne hyperspectral survey of the same\u00a0Navarre Creek\u00a0area to identify prospective exploration targets in an area, many of which are largely concealed by glacial till.\nThe ground magnetics survey looked specifically for magnetite and magnetic-bearing minerals, some of which have been identified in limited outcroppings, while the hyperspectral imaging helps to identify alteration minerals often associated with precious metal deposition.\nHyperspectral imaging incorporates a small airplane with mounted infrared lights and sensors to detect a wide range of wavelengths, mineral absorption and reflectance within the target area. The wavelength data collected in this survey are VNIR (Visible and Near-Infrared), SWIR (Short-Wave Infrared), and LWIR (Long-Wave Infrared). The human eye can detect wavelengths (colours) from 390 nanometers ('nm') to 700nm. The VNIR and SWIR sensors collected wavelength data from 390nm to 2,450nm, while the LWIR sensors ranged from 8,000nm to 12,000nm.\nThe Navarre Creek\u00a0project is located within an intrusive dome complex, where the magnetic components in overlying volcanic lithologies are destroyed by silicic alteration associated with steam-heated, acidic, and oxidised hydrothermal fluids. The survey highlighted several such areas including the\u00a0Lehman Cr",

It would seem a small step for such a strong leader to take, and as, if not more justifiable than taking tinpot leaders from their own countries. Perhaps this is why the funding is being dragged out,  and perhaps the board of PXC have knowledge of a buyout from the USA on security grounds, hence they invested more knowing they will make a return on such, but never themselves be calling the shots here. Been more than a slow burner and with PM's and copper so high, can't imagine any worth will be allowed to fall into others hands easily with a shrewd, wise patriotic POTUS putting his country and people first, something the West hasn't seen for decades and sadly we never again will now.",

The ExGen acquisition / merger completed at the end of December, so Roulston now has an official link to Phoenix. As well as MTB, he's Managing Director of WestBay Capital, and getting funding away for PXC will have a direct benefit to all parties involved. It's ExGen's flagship properly (well, 20% of it anyway), and is the cornerstone strategy for MTB, ExG and PXC. Maybe it just needed the acquisition to take place first before anything more formal could be put in motion? Speculation of course, but why would Phoenix not look to WestBay for traditional funding if the bond is strugging to take off?",

          "content": "Disco12\u2026 I don\u2019t necessarily think that EXG is the vehicle that will lift PXC out of its current malaise.  But I do think that EXG has significant influence over how PXC will do so.  Bear in mind that EXG originally disposed of its 80% share in Konnex Resources to PXC.  I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if EXG retained some form of step-in rights to PXC\u2019s shares in Konnex Resources in an insolvency event occurring in PXC.  Furthermore, under the terms of the revised Carry Agreement from Dec 24, any funding deal that PXC agrees is subject to ultimate sanction by EXG.  Personally, I believe that EXG has PXC ransomed, which is the reason why PXC can\u2019t raise funds for the Empire venture.  I believe that PXC has tried to play its way out of this by assuming that EXG would run out of liquidity before PXC, but EXG\u2019s recently -completed merger with MTB, and EXG\u2019s recent silver streaming deals have all but scuppered that position from PXC\u2019s perspective. PXC, as I see it, is well and truly hamstrung, and EXG is in the driving seat.  It is only a matter of time before PXC will have to concede its position in control of Empire, and only EXG is in a position to benefit from it. AIMHO DYOR",

          "content": "Disco, that\u2019s a very good question, one which I have spent many an hour considering.  Under the subject heading \u201cPCC\u201d, I have given you a fairly lengthy synopsis of where I believe we are in terms of this investment.  Your own legal expertise may cast additional light on the points that I have raised, and I would be pleased to hear your perspective.  Suffice to say that I am of the opinion that EXG is the most effective means to \u201cthe action\u201d so far as an investment in the Empire mine is concerned.  I originally invested in PXC when NIU first invested in the bond.  This arrangement between NIU and PXC went sour in or around late 2024, at around the same time that the Revised Carry Agreement between PXC and EXG was executed.  It\u2019s my contention that NIU went away as a result of impracticalities in the relationship between PXC and EXG, which resulted in a hurried Revised Carry Agreement intended to either save the NIU bond deal, or reincarnate an alternative bond deal.  Unfortunately however, the Dec 24 Revised Carry Agreement took PXC deeper into the mire, by ultimately handing the cards to EXG, who now have the ultimate sanction over PXC\u2019s funding options. After PXC\u2019s collapse, I looked into EXG and considered that in the event of an insolvency event in PXC, the Dec 2024 Revised Carry Agreement would still apply, putting EXG in the position of being the only vehicle capable of lifting the condition.  As a result, I decided to invest in EXG as a hedge.  I have since continued to invest funds in EXG as the news has flowed regarding their merger with MTB and silver stream investments.  All bodes well for PXC looking forward\u2026 whereas for PXC, things loom heavy as I see them. AIMHO GLA DYOR",

Bear in mind though that it was EXG that originally sold an 80% stake in Konnex Resources to PXC.  It would be totally reasonable to consider that EXG retained some rights to step-in in an insolvency event being triggered by PXC, in order to protect its residual 20% investment in Konnex. On what basis do you consider that a material change in EXG gives PXC the right to reduce/eliminate EXG\u2019s shareholding in Konnex Resources? It will be the creditors of PXC that will be the final arbiter of an insolvency event in PXC, not PXC itself.  \u201cParking\u201d PXC costs the company $1.5m per annum, which will serve to worsen the state of affairs of PXC, and drive it further towards insolvency.  If PXC sells its stake in Konnex, it does so, with the condition that EXG is the final arbiter over any funding of the stake in Konnex that PXC is disposing.  It still leaves EXG in the position that the holder of the 80% stake in Konnex is ultimately at the mercy of EXG, leaving EXG being the only realistic purchaser of the 80% Konnex stake for pennies on the dollar.

The the mid point of 10-15kt and that's around 25mt of copper required just for data centres over the next 4-5 years. Escondido the world's largest copper mine - by orders of magnitude - produces 1.4mt annually - it's like 2x bigger than the next top 10 mines (all about 0.5mt each) add up to around 6-7 mt per annum - production... Global copper production was around 23 million metric tons (MT) in 2024, with Chile leading by far (5.3 MT, 23%) Never mind the electricity gap... But what about the copper gap? Planned hyper scale and global data centres alone will use circa 10-20% of global copper supply. What about everything else? EV - is the biggest rising demand , extending replacing ageing power grid networks, general construction wiring, military demand, developing world - ie virgin demand - in Africa, India and booming South East Asia It's like trying to squeeze the contents of the Hoover dam through a garden hose.

The last news from the nomad was there was still sock to clear\u2026. \u201c Phoenix Copper* (PXC LN) 2p, Mkt Cap \u00a36.0m \u2013 Refinancing of short-term loan facility (Phoenix holds 80% of the Empire mining property in Idaho) Phoenix Copper has announced that it has drawn funds from a $2.1m Convertible Loan Note (CLN) from Indigo Capital to repay $1.46m of a Short-Term Loan Facility to Riverfort Capital. The company has drawn \u201c$1.96m net of a fixed 5% coupon and a 2% commitment fee\u201d from Indigo Capital which is described as \u201ca private family office investor\u201d. Exercising the CLNs, which have a 12 months term, allows the purchase of Phoenix Copper shares at \u201ca 20% discount to the prior 5 day lowest Volume Weighted Average Price\u201d. Today\u2019s announcement clarifies that Indigo Capital \u201cmay convert up to $1 million prior to 30 April 2026, plus a further $250,000 if the Company\u2019s share price has closed at 5.5 pence or higher for 5 consecutive trading days prior to 30 April 2026. From 1 May 2026 the CLN investor may convert the CLN in full\u201d. A further \u201c$627,251 of outstanding principal and interest\u201d remains due to Riverfort Capital. Conclusion: Phoenix Copper is refinancing its short-term debt facility as it progresses development of the Empire open-pit mine project in Idaho. *SP Angel acts as Nomad to Phoenix Copper\u201d https://www.share-talk.com/sp-angel-todays-market-view-thursday-4th-december-2025/ That still sets this up for indigo to depress the sp for a better VWAp.

Leaving 20m. But volumes have been really high\u2026. From AI\u2026 \u201cOn December 4, 2025 (the conversion day), over 12.7 million shares were traded. On December 11 and 12, 2025 (around the time of director buys), a combined 27.2 million shares were traded. These volumes alone far exceed the ~24.5 million shares Riverfort held, providing more than enough liquidity for Riverfort to have exited their entire position to various market buyers, not just the directors. \u201c So what we can assume is that they have gone below 3% at least. If not zero. But there has been no TR1\u2019s either way. Either for Riverforts high position of around 7.5% or for the regulatory crossings at the lower levels (7,6,5,4,3%). Even if the crossing was within the two day window they should still have RNS\u2019s the 3% break or disclose a holding if 3% or higher. They haven't because Riverfort rely on obfuscation to hide their selling keeping PI\u2019s in the dark so traders don\u2019t also sell compromising their price points. Welcome to AIM! I am used to it and the MAR are a waste of time as I have reported several in the past! I think we can in the absence of regulatory announcements assume that Riverfort are at least below 3% if not zero. It would be helpful if DP ensured that the company published useful regulatory disclosures rather than his constant ramping! So even if Riverforts are out we are still in the next phase of Indigo likely to play similar games to milk every fraction of a penny before deducting their 20% from the VWAP. Usual caveats Trek",

I rarely trade a share that I am not also willing to or am actively also holding...as I believe in the potential! It's more of tweeking the holding between perceived underweight and overweight postions in a larger portfolio of investments .....and only a % in shares in any case!

That uplift comes purely from revenue \u2014 no heroic assumptions, no cost cuts, no mine plan changes. Same open-pit, same 8-year mine life, same processing route, same capital intensity. The rising metal prices are all upside. Investment for this surely must come. The bond coupon would today be paying 12%, plus a bagful of warrants. I\u2019d be comfortable with 100m shares, so roughly 33% of the company. The upside for all of us would be huge at today\u2019s prices.",

It would seem a small step for such a strong leader to take, and as, if not more justifiable than taking tinpot leaders from their own countries. Perhaps this is why the funding is being dragged out,  and perhaps the board of PXC have knowledge of a buyout from the USA on security grounds, hence they invested more knowing they will make a return on such, but never themselves be calling the shots here. Been more than a slow burner and with PM's and copper so high, can't imagine any worth will be allowed to fall into others hands easily with a shrewd, wise patriotic POTUS putting his country and people first, something the West hasn't seen for decades and sadly we never again will now.",

The ExGen acquisition / merger completed at the end of December, so Roulston now has an official link to Phoenix.

It's ExGen's flagship properly (well, 20% of it anyway), and is the cornerstone strategy for MTB, ExG and PXC. Maybe it just needed the acquisition to take place first before anything more formal could be put in motion? Speculation of course, but why would Phoenix not look to WestBay for traditional funding if the bond is strugging to take off?",

But I do think that EXG has significant influence over how PXC will do so.  Bear in mind that EXG originally disposed of its 80% share in Konnex Resources to PXC.  I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if EXG retained some form of step-in rights to PXC\u2019s shares in Konnex Resources in an insolvency event occurring in PXC.  Furthermore, under the terms of the revised Carry Agreement from Dec 24, any funding deal that PXC agrees is subject to ultimate sanction by EXG.  Personally, I believe that EXG has PXC ransomed, which is the reason why PXC can\u2019t raise funds for the Empire venture.  I believe that PXC has tried to play its way out of this by assuming that EXG would run out of liquidity before PXC, but EXG\u2019s recently -completed merger with MTB, and EXG\u2019s recent silver streaming deals have all but scuppered that position from PXC\u2019s perspective. PXC, as I see it, is well and truly hamstrung, and EXG is in the driving seat.  It is only a matter of time before PXC will have to concede its position in control of Empire, and only EXG is in a position to benefit from it. AIMHO DYOR",

Under the subject heading \u201cPCC\u201d, I have given you a fairly lengthy synopsis of where I believe we are in terms of this investment.  Your own legal expertise may cast additional light on the points that I have raised, and I would be pleased to hear your perspective.  Suffice to say that I am of the opinion that EXG is the most effective means to \u201cthe action\u201d so far as an investment in the Empire mine is concerned.  I originally invested in PXC when NIU first invested in the bond.  This arrangement between NIU and PXC went sour in or around late 2024, at around the same time that the Revised Carry Agreement between PXC and EXG was executed.  It\u2019s my contention that NIU went away as a result of impracticalities in the relationship between PXC and EXG, which resulted in a hurried Revised Carry Agreement intended to either save the NIU bond deal, or reincarnate an alternative bond deal.  Unfortunately however, the Dec 24 Revised Carry Agreement took PXC deeper into the mire, by ultimately handing the cards to EXG, who now have the ultimate sanction over PXC\u2019s funding options. After PXC\u2019s collapse, I looked into EXG and considered that in the event of an insolvency event in PXC, the Dec 2024 Revised Carry Agreement would still apply, putting EXG in the position of being the only vehicle capable of lifting the condition.  As a result, I decided to invest in EXG as a hedge.  I have since continued to invest funds in EXG as the news has flowed regarding their merger with MTB and silver stream investments.  All bodes well for PXC looking forward\u2026 whereas for PXC, things loom heavy as I see them. AIMHO GLA DYOR",

Bear in mind though that it was EXG that originally sold an 80% stake in Konnex Resources to PXC.  It would be totally reasonable to consider that EXG retained some rights to step-in in an insolvency event being triggered by PXC, in order to protect its residual 20% investment in Konnex. On what basis do you consider that a material change in EXG gives PXC the right to reduce/eliminate EXG\u2019s shareholding in Konnex Resources? It will be the creditors of PXC that will be the final arbiter of an insolvency event in PXC, not PXC itself.  \u201cParking\u201d PXC costs the company $1.5m per annum, which will serve to worsen the state of affairs of PXC, and drive it further towards insolvency.  If PXC sells its stake in Konnex, it does so, with the condition that EXG is the final arbiter over any funding of the stake in Konnex that PXC is disposing.  It still leaves EXG in the position that the holder of the 80% stake in Konnex is ultimately at the mercy of EXG, leaving EXG being the only realistic purchaser of the 80% Konnex stake for pennies on the dollar.

Small data centres use from 5k to 15kt ... So how many data centres are being built globally? Analysts project massive global expansion, with some expecting over 2,000 new data centers built by 2030. The the mid point of 10-15kt and that's around 25mt of copper required just for data centres over the next 4-5 years. Escondido the world's largest copper mine - by orders of magnitude - produces 1.4mt annually - it's like 2x bigger than the next top 10 mines (all about 0.5mt each) add up to around 6-7 mt per annum - production... Global copper production was around 23 million metric tons (MT) in 2024, with Chile leading by far (5.3 MT, 23%) Never mind the electricity gap... But what about the copper gap? Planned hyper scale and global data centres alone will use circa 10-20% of global copper supply. What about everything else? EV - is the biggest rising demand , extending replacing ageing power grid networks, general construction wiring, military demand, developing world - ie virgin demand - in Africa, India and booming South East Asia It's like trying to squeeze the contents of the Hoover dam through a garden hose. We need to find and build another 5-8 Escondidas in the next 6 years. OR / AND price has to rise a lot.\u201c Trek",

It's ExGen's flagship properly (well, 20% of it anyway), and is the cornerstone strategy for MTB, ExG and PXC. Maybe it just needed the acquisition to take place first before anything more formal could be put in motion? Speculation of course, but why would Phoenix not look to WestBay for traditional funding if the bond is strugging to take off?",

But I do think that EXG has significant influence over how PXC will do so.  Bear in mind that EXG originally disposed of its 80% share in Konnex Resources to PXC.  I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if EXG retained some form of step-in rights to PXC\u2019s shares in Konnex Resources in an insolvency event occurring in PXC.  Furthermore, under the terms of the revised Carry Agreement from Dec 24, any funding deal that PXC agrees is subject to ultimate sanction by EXG.  Personally, I believe that EXG has PXC ransomed, which is the reason why PXC can\u2019t raise funds for the Empire venture.  I believe that PXC has tried to play its way out of this by assuming that EXG would run out of liquidity before PXC, but EXG\u2019s recently -completed merger with MTB, and EXG\u2019s recent silver streaming deals have all but scuppered that position from PXC\u2019s perspective. PXC, as I see it, is well and truly hamstrung, and EXG is in the driving seat.  It is only a matter of time before PXC will have to concede its position in control of Empire, and only EXG is in a position to benefit from it. AIMHO DYOR",

Under the subject heading \u201cPCC\u201d, I have given you a fairly lengthy synopsis of where I believe we are in terms of this investment.  Your own legal expertise may cast additional light on the points that I have raised, and I would be pleased to hear your perspective.  Suffice to say that I am of the opinion that EXG is the most effective means to \u201cthe action\u201d so far as an investment in the Empire mine is concerned.  I originally invested in PXC when NIU first invested in the bond.  This arrangement between NIU and PXC went sour in or around late 2024, at around the same time that the Revised Carry Agreement between PXC and EXG was executed.  It\u2019s my contention that NIU went away as a result of impracticalities in the relationship between PXC and EXG, which resulted in a hurried Revised Carry Agreement intended to either save the NIU bond deal, or reincarnate an alternative bond deal.  Unfortunately however, the Dec 24 Revised Carry Agreement took PXC deeper into the mire, by ultimately handing the cards to EXG, who now have the ultimate sanction over PXC\u2019s funding options. After PXC\u2019s collapse, I looked into EXG and considered that in the event of an insolvency event in PXC, the Dec 2024 Revised Carry Agreement would still apply, putting EXG in the position of being the only vehicle capable of lifting the condition.  As a result, I decided to invest in EXG as a hedge.  I have since continued to invest funds in EXG as the news has flowed regarding their merger with MTB and silver stream investments.  All bodes well for PXC looking forward\u2026 whereas for PXC, things loom heavy as I see them. AIMHO GLA DYOR",

Bear in mind though that it was EXG that originally sold an 80% stake in Konnex Resources to PXC.  It would be totally reasonable to consider that EXG retained some rights to step-in in an insolvency event being triggered by PXC, in order to protect its residual 20% investment in Konnex. On what basis do you consider that a material change in EXG gives PXC the right to reduce/eliminate EXG\u2019s shareholding in Konnex Resources? It will be the creditors of PXC that will be the final arbiter of an insolvency event in PXC, not PXC itself.  \u201cParking\u201d PXC costs the company $1.5m per annum, which will serve to worsen the state of affairs of PXC, and drive it further towards insolvency.  If PXC sells its stake in Konnex, it does so, with the condition that EXG is the final arbiter over any funding of the stake in Konnex that PXC is disposing.  It still leaves EXG in the position that the holder of the 80% stake in Konnex is ultimately at the mercy of EXG, leaving EXG being the only realistic purchaser of the 80% Konnex stake for pennies on the dollar.

Bear in mind though that it was EXG that originally sold an 80% stake in Konnex Resources to PXC.  It would be totally reasonable to consider that EXG retained some rights to step-in in an insolvency event being triggered by PXC, in order to protect its residual 20% investment in Konnex. On what basis do you consider that a material change in EXG gives PXC the right to reduce/eliminate EXG\u2019s shareholding in Konnex Resources? It will be the creditors of PXC that will be the final arbiter of an insolvency event in PXC, not PXC itself.  \u201cParking\u201d PXC costs the company $1.5m per annum, which will serve to worsen the state of affairs of PXC, and drive it further towards insolvency.  If PXC sells its stake in Konnex, it does so, with the condition that EXG is the final arbiter over any funding of the stake in Konnex that PXC is disposing.  It still leaves EXG in the position that the holder of the 80% stake in Konnex is ultimately at the mercy of EXG, leaving EXG being the only realistic purchaser of the 80% Konnex stake for pennies on the dollar.

The Company is also pleased to confirm the effect of increased metal prices on its 2024 Empire open-pit pre-feasibility study (\"PFS\") economic model.\nPartial Conversion of CLN\nFurther to the announcement on 4 December 2025, the Company confirms that the CLN holder, Indigo, has converted $536,000 at 1.483 pence per share into 26,981,814 new ordinary shares of no par value in the Company (\"New Ordinary Shares\").\nApplication has been made for the New Ordinary Shares to be admitted to trading on AIM (\"Admission\"). It is expected that Admission will become effective and dealings will commence at 8:00 am on or around 26 January 2026.\nThe Company has been informed that Indigo has entered into agreements to divest 24,181,814 of the New Ordinary Shares to various equity funds and family offices in Europe and elsewhere, as soon as practicable following Admission.\nTotal Voting Rights\nFollowing Admission, the Company will have 287,995,114 ordinary shares outstanding. Shareholders may use this number as the denominator for the calculation by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change in their interest in, the issued share capital of the Company.\nPotential Impact of Current Metal Prices on the 2024 Economic Model\nThe 2024 open-pit PFS economic model (the \"2024 Model\") was generated at the time using conservative, near-term trailing average metal prices of $4.45 / lb copper price, a $2,325 / oz gold price and a $27.25 / oz silver price. In order to illustrate the potential impact of current metal prices on the economics of the open pit, the Company has applied the following metal pricing to the 2024 Model; $5.58 / lb copper, $4,338 / oz gold and $70.73 / oz silver. Should these metal prices be maintained, the impact would be significant and would result in cumulative pre-tax net (after repaying estimated pre-production capital costs) cashflow of $405.80 million over the 8.5 year life of mine, as well as a 7.5% pre-tax Net Present Value (\"NPV\") of $252.11 million and a pre-tax Internal Rate of Return of 98.4%.\nA comparison of the impact to the 2024 Model is summarised in the table below:\nProject Evaluation Overview\n2024 PFS Before Tax / After Tax\n2026 Before Tax / After Tax\n% Change\nCumulative Net Cashflow (millions)\n$152.98 / $132.44\n$405.80 / $350.89\n165.3 / 164.9% Increase\nNPV @ 5.0% (millions)\n$105.44 / $89.55\n$293.85 / $252.34\n178.7 / 181.8% Increase\nNPV @ 7.5% (millions)\n$87.86 / $73.75\n$252.11 / $215.67\n186.9 / 192.4% Increase\nNPV @ 10.0% (millions)\n$73.29 / $60.71\n$217.34 / $185.17\n196.5 / 205% Increase\nInternal Rate of Return\n46.4% / 40.2%\n98.4% / 86.6%\n52 / 46.4% Increase\nThe 2026 Before Tax / After Tax results presented above have been internally estimated by the Company and have not been verified by the Company's independent technical consultants or Qualified Person. The results of this comparison are illustrative only and are not intended to imply a change in the Empire open pit mineral reserve nor are they intended to imply a new or updated Empire open pit economic model.\nThe Company also refers to its ongoing discussions with the US based bond investor (the \"Investor\"), first announced on 12 June 2025. These discussions have taken longer than initially anticipated due to other transactions the Investor has been completing. Although there can be no certainty a definitive agreement will be reached with the Investor, the Directors look forward to finalising the discussions and progressing towards completion. The Company looks forward to providing shareholders with further updates as appropriate.\nMarket Abuse Regulation (MAR) Disclosure\nThe Company deems the information contained within this announcement to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014, which has been incorporated into\u00a0UK\u00a0law by the\u00a0European Union\u00a0(Withdrawal) Act 2018.

The historic Empire underground mine, located beneath the surface of the Company's proposed open pit, boasts a rich history of producing high-grade copper, gold, silver, zinc, and tungsten.\nSince 2017,\u00a0Phoenix\u00a0has executed extensive drilling initiatives, resulting in an expansion of the Empire Open-Pit resource by over 200%. In\u00a0May 2024\u00a0the Company published its inaugural mineral reserve statement for the\u00a0Empire Open-Pit Mine. Proven and Probable mineral reserves are 10.1 million tonnes containing 109,487,970 lbs of copper, 104,000 oz of gold and 4,654,400 oz of silver. This reserve was estimated using assay data from 485 drill holes, extensive geological modelling, metallurgical recovery test work, geotechnical evaluation, and mine design. The reserve represents a combined 66,467 tonnes of copper equivalent metal.\nIn addition to the\u00a0Empire Mine,\u00a0Phoenix's\u00a0holdings in the district also encompass the Horseshoe, White Knob, and Blue\u00a0Bird Mines, all of which have been producers of copper, gold, silver, zinc, lead, and tungsten from underground operations, a new high-grade silver and lead orebody at\u00a0Red Star, and the\u00a0Navarre Creek\u00a0gold exploration project, which was first drilled in 2023. The Company's land package at Empire spans 8,434 acres (34 sq km).\nPhoenix\u00a0also owns two cobalt properties situated along the Idaho Cobalt Belt to the north of Empire. An Earn-In Agreement has been established concerning one of these properties.\nPhoenix\u00a0is listed on\u00a0London's\u00a0AIM (PXC), and trades on\u00a0New York's\u00a0OTCQX Market (PXCLF and PXCLY (ADRs)).

In the context of early-stage startup financing, prepayment is a highly sensitive and often restricted term for the following reasons: 1. Investor Resistance Loss of Upside: Investors generally oppose prepayment clauses because they want the option to convert their debt into high-value equity. If a company prepays the loan just before a major funding round or exit, the investor loses the \"upside\" of converting at a discount or under a valuation cap. \"No Prepayment\" Clauses: Most standard startup term sheets explicitly state that the company cannot prepay the notes without the prior written consent of the noteholders. 2. Strategic Use for Founders Avoiding Dilution: Founders may seek the right to prepay if the company becomes unexpectedly profitable or has access to cheaper capital. By repaying the loan in cash, they avoid the \"unfavorable terms\" of conversion that would dilute their ownership. Clean-Up: Prepayment can be used to \"clean up\" a cap table by removing small debt holders before a new institutional investor comes on board. 3. Automatic Repayment Events Prepayment can sometimes be triggered automatically by specific \"Events of Default\" or corporate changes, rather than a voluntary choice by the company: Insolvency: Legal requirements may force repayment if the company enters bankruptcy. Change of Control: If the company is acquired, notes may be paid off immediately in cash rather than converted, depending on the agreed terms. Material Breach: Failure to follow the agreed-upon negative covenants can trigger immediate repayment. 4. Valuation Implications In financial modeling, the \"callability\" (the issuer's right to prepay) reduces the fair value of the note for the investor. If a note is \"called\" for prepayment, the holder usually has a final window to choose between accepting the cash prepayment or exercising their conversion right to shares.",

Small data centres use from 5k to 15kt ... So how many data centres are being built globally? Analysts project massive global expansion, with some expecting over 2,000 new data centers built by 2030. The the mid point of 10-15kt and that's around 25mt of copper required just for data centres over the next 4-5 years. Escondido the world's largest copper mine - by orders of magnitude - produces 1.4mt annually - it's like 2x bigger than the next top 10 mines (all about 0.5mt each) add up to around 6-7 mt per annum - production... Global copper production was around 23 million metric tons (MT) in 2024, with Chile leading by far (5.3 MT, 23%) Never mind the electricity gap... But what about the copper gap? Planned hyper scale and global data centres alone will use circa 10-20% of global copper supply. What about everything else? EV - is the biggest rising demand , extending replacing ageing power grid networks, general construction wiring, military demand, developing world - ie virgin demand - in Africa, India and booming South East Asia It's like trying to squeeze the contents of the Hoover dam through a garden hose. We need to find and build another 5-8 Escondidas in the next 6 years. OR / AND price has to rise a lot.\u201c Trek",

But I think that the Board actually know what they are doing. The thought did cross my mind that why would professional investors, family offices etc deal in shares for PXC from Indigo, if the sp in the market drops sufficiently to leave Indigo with little or no margin to profit from it?  If they wanted to invest in PXC, why wouldn\u2019t they just pick up shares from the market instead? Could be a smart thing the BOD\u2019s are doing to push the sp down, as a hedge against Indigo dropping a load of  cheap shares onto the market.  If the BOD\u2019s keep dropping bad news to keep the sp depressed, it at least keeps the supply of shares in circulation relatively low.  This strategy only works in the case that the new mystery investor gets his finger out and the BOD\u2019s secure the new funding in fairly short order, and some of the bond funds are used to redeem the Indigo CLN\u2019s early. Short term pain; long term gain.  I\u2019m ok with that, because I\u2019m so underwater, I\u2019m going nowhere fast in any case.  If my theory is correct then we could be thanking the BOD\u2019s for such incompetence.  Keep the sp as low as possible until \u201cJames\u201d gets his feet under the table\u2026 that\u2019s James, with the Bond, by the way. GLA.",

In the context of early-stage startup financing, prepayment is a highly sensitive and often restricted term for the following reasons: 1. Investor Resistance Loss of Upside: Investors generally oppose prepayment clauses because they want the option to convert their debt into high-value equity. If a company prepays the loan just before a major funding round or exit, the investor loses the \"upside\" of converting at a discount or under a valuation cap. \"No Prepayment\" Clauses: Most standard startup term sheets explicitly state that the company cannot prepay the notes without the prior written consent of the noteholders. 2. Strategic Use for Founders Avoiding Dilution: Founders may seek the right to prepay if the company becomes unexpectedly profitable or has access to cheaper capital. By repaying the loan in cash, they avoid the \"unfavorable terms\" of conversion that would dilute their ownership. Clean-Up: Prepayment can be used to \"clean up\" a cap table by removing small debt holders before a new institutional investor comes on board. 3. Automatic Repayment Events Prepayment can sometimes be triggered automatically by specific \"Events of Default\" or corporate changes, rather than a voluntary choice by the company: Insolvency: Legal requirements may force repayment if the company enters bankruptcy. Change of Control: If the company is acquired, notes may be paid off immediately in cash rather than converted, depending on the agreed terms. Material Breach: Failure to follow the agreed-upon negative covenants can trigger immediate repayment. 4. Valuation Implications In financial modeling, the \"callability\" (the issuer's right to prepay) reduces the fair value of the note for the investor. If a note is \"called\" for prepayment, the holder usually has a final window to choose between accepting the cash prepayment or exercising their conversion right to shares.",

Small data centres use from 5k to 15kt ... So how many data centres are being built globally? Analysts project massive global expansion, with some expecting over 2,000 new data centers built by 2030. The the mid point of 10-15kt and that's around 25mt of copper required just for data centres over the next 4-5 years. Escondido the world's largest copper mine - by orders of magnitude - produces 1.4mt annually - it's like 2x bigger than the next top 10 mines (all about 0.5mt each) add up to around 6-7 mt per annum - production... Global copper production was around 23 million metric tons (MT) in 2024, with Chile leading by far (5.3 MT, 23%) Never mind the electricity gap... But what about the copper gap? Planned hyper scale and global data centres alone will use circa 10-20% of global copper supply. What about everything else? EV - is the biggest rising demand , extending replacing ageing power grid networks, general construction wiring, military demand, developing world - ie virgin demand - in Africa, India and booming South East Asia It's like trying to squeeze the contents of the Hoover dam through a garden hose.

Application has been made for the New Ordinary Shares to be admitted to trading on AIM (\"Admission\"). It is expected that Admission will become effective and dealings will commence at 8:00 am on or around 26 January 2026. The Company has been informed that Indigo has entered into agreements to divest 24,181,814 of the New Ordinary Shares to various equity funds and family offices in Europe and elsewhere, as soon as practicable following Admission. Following Admission, the Company will have 287,995,114 ordinary shares outstanding.

In the context of early-stage startup financing, prepayment is a highly sensitive and often restricted term for the following reasons: 1. Investor Resistance Loss of Upside: Investors generally oppose prepayment clauses because they want the option to convert their debt into high-value equity. If a company prepays the loan just before a major funding round or exit, the investor loses the \"upside\" of converting at a discount or under a valuation cap. \"No Prepayment\" Clauses: Most standard startup term sheets explicitly state that the company cannot prepay the notes without the prior written consent of the noteholders. 2. Strategic Use for Founders Avoiding Dilution: Founders may seek the right to prepay if the company becomes unexpectedly profitable or has access to cheaper capital. By repaying the loan in cash, they avoid the \"unfavorable terms\" of conversion that would dilute their ownership. Clean-Up: Prepayment can be used to \"clean up\" a cap table by removing small debt holders before a new institutional investor comes on board. 3. Automatic Repayment Events Prepayment can sometimes be triggered automatically by specific \"Events of Default\" or corporate changes, rather than a voluntary choice by the company: Insolvency: Legal requirements may force repayment if the company enters bankruptcy. Change of Control: If the company is acquired, notes may be paid off immediately in cash rather than converted, depending on the agreed terms. Material Breach: Failure to follow the agreed-upon negative covenants can trigger immediate repayment. 4. Valuation Implications In financial modeling, the \"callability\" (the issuer's right to prepay) reduces the fair value of the note for the investor. If a note is \"called\" for prepayment, the holder usually has a final window to choose between accepting the cash prepayment or exercising their conversion right to shares.",

Small data centres use from 5k to 15kt ... So how many data centres are being built globally? Analysts project massive global expansion, with some expecting over 2,000 new data centers built by 2030. The the mid point of 10-15kt and that's around 25mt of copper required just for data centres over the next 4-5 years. Escondido the world's largest copper mine - by orders of magnitude - produces 1.4mt annually - it's like 2x bigger than the next top 10 mines (all about 0.5mt each) add up to around 6-7 mt per annum - production... Global copper production was around 23 million metric tons (MT) in 2024, with Chile leading by far (5.3 MT, 23%) Never mind the electricity gap... But what about the copper gap? Planned hyper scale and global data centres alone will use circa 10-20% of global copper supply. What about everything else? EV - is the biggest rising demand , extending replacing ageing power grid networks, general construction wiring, military demand, developing world - ie virgin demand - in Africa, India and booming South East Asia It's like trying to squeeze the contents of the Hoover dam through a garden hose. We need to find and build another 5-8 Escondidas in the next 6 years. OR / AND price has to rise a lot.\u201c Trek",

The investigations are being undertaken with input from the Company's professional advisers and a further announcement will be made as soon as these investigations have concluded.\nTo minimise any disruption to the ongoing operations of the Company during the period of Mr Edwards-Jones's and Mr Wilkins's suspension, the Company has put interim financial oversight arrangements in place while it advances the appointment of an interim CFO. This interim role will be covered until such time as Mr Wilkins's and Mr Edwards-Jones's suspension is over and a conclusion has been reached on the outcome of the investigation.

          "content": "Thanks \u2014 yes, I meant the CFO and Chairman. The removal of two senior executives should be viewed in context. Given the company\u2019s underlying assets, it\u2019s difficult to justify a market cap below \u00a33m, yet that\u2019s where the stock is currently trading. This disconnect highlights just how oversold the situation has become. The shares were already heavily de-rated from around 6p at the start of the year, so the additional ~50% drop following decisive board action feels excessive rather than fundamental. In reality, markets tend to reward strong governance and transparency, especially when issues are confronted rather than ignored. Existing shareholders \u2014 and new buyers \u2014 generally value that approach. It\u2019s also worth noting that there are AIM shell companies with no meaningful assets trading at valuations above \u00a33m. Against that backdrop, PXC\u2019s valuation looks increasingly disconnected from reality. The focus now shifts to execution: appointing a new CFO, securing short- and long-term financing, and stabilising operations. Importantly, these financing discussions were already referenced in the January 2025 update, when the share price was around 2\u20133p \u2014 a level that already appeared oversold at the time. With hindsight, it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the board changes announced recently had been in progress for some time, potentially explaining the prolonged weakness in the share price. With those issues now addressed, the stock finally has a chance to reset and re-rate from deeply depressed levels. In short, this looks less like a business impairment and more like capitulation pricing driven by uncertainty \u2014 uncertainty that is now being actively resolved.",

If you or I were on the board, adding a little more skin may give confidence and also draw in more or keep others from abandoning the ship. Perhaps directors would also be aware such an action will then ensure a very lucrative salary by dragging this out for a few more years, then if such. it would be money well spent. Also, seems odd that a British group have discovered what is deemed significant wealth in the USA that was oblivious to the Americans. This seems unlikely and open to questions as to why they never researched the potential themselves being hardly short of hi tech, local knowledge, money etc. Also, should the Brits have discovered what was under the Americans noses, then I wonder that if it is a good as they say it is, the Americans will throw as many obstacles in the way to ensue that they pressure the group to breaking point and keep all profits for themselves, by hampering loans, by imposing rules and laws to ensure that extraction is as costly and long winded as feasible to then get the company bought out for a song as they run out of money waiting. So I hope that all the above is just irrational fear, but after seeing the share price plunge from many multiples of it's current price, still wonder if my gut feeling was correct. Whilst PM's and Copper may have risen dramatically, unless having any to sell, not in tiny fragments buried withing millions of tons of rock and earth, then the costs are growing but the income is still non existent. Debt is expensive and more so the longer this is dragged out. My gold Sov is worth \u00a3800 ish, but should I choose to grind it into tiny fragments, placing each fragment in a lump of rock, and scatter those rocks over acres and bury it under tons more debris, I doubt you would give me a pound for the license to find it, despite 'certainty it is out there' especially if you had to jump through lengthy hoops to obtain permission and to gain the funds from others when more interested parties to extract the wealth can pull strings harder. I guess if the new skin is because the board feel certain or more confident funding is coming soon, then we will all be happy and singing from the same hymn sheet, juries out until then from me. Re posted as at the time, when I questioned the motive of the board buying more, I was just insulted so seems I was right, their skin in the game counts for nothing.  Likely the Americans will snap it up on the cheap after toying with the dim limey's, who in turn have used shareholders cash to ensure a good few years of lucrative salaries and perhaps more invisible earnings.",

I\u2019ve been calling for the CFO to go for a long time - probably around September 2024 when he hid NIU hadn\u2019t allowed them to draw down the bonds as per the schedule they\u2019d communicated halfway down the interims. Then did an interview post market saying there was no problem with bond investor and that he saw this as a billion pound company. Likewise the Chairman should\u2019ve fallen on his sword long ago, it\u2019s been clear he\u2019s not had the contacts/competence to sell these bonds to anyone other than NIU who mugged him here and at his other gig at CRTM. This was on the telegram group which i\u2019m no longer a member of but i\u2019m sure someone can vouch. So no i\u2019d have got rid ages ago, and it\u2019s not come as a surprise they\u2019re alleged of being bent however it\u2019s too little too late at 1p and \u00a32.7m market cap. To answer your question what\u2019s changed in the last month: - It became clear that it took them 6 weeks to notify Indigo had converted at 1.48p. - That the board potentially bought shares so Indigo had volume to convert and sell into. The SP then pumped to 3p on the back of director buys. - It became apparent that the clowns in charge paid off Riverfort with the Indigo CLN without checking the terms of it and now may have a prepayment penalty liability of $109k (which they don\u2019t have) - The two in charge of finance are being investigated for being corrupt. - Gold up 10% - Copper price flat - PXC down 65% That\u2019s what\u2019s changed. I\u2019ve answered your question so perhaps you can answer all the ones in my previous post? Cheers.",

That's to keep the lights on... NIU have security over the Empire mine... they can't sell it to pay them their $5m back, it goes to NIU if they default. How do they pay any fees associated with selling the $75m worth of bonds needed -  advisers, finders fees etc.? Confetti, and lots of it.

The Company has been informed that Indigo has entered into agreements to divest 24,181,814 of the New Ordinary Shares to various equity funds and family offices in Europe and elsewhere, as soon as practicable following Admission. Following Admission, the Company will have 287,995,114 ordinary shares outstanding.

In the context of early-stage startup financing, prepayment is a highly sensitive and often restricted term for the following reasons: 1. Investor Resistance Loss of Upside: Investors generally oppose prepayment clauses because they want the option to convert their debt into high-value equity. If a company prepays the loan just before a major funding round or exit, the investor loses the \"upside\" of converting at a discount or under a valuation cap. \"No Prepayment\" Clauses: Most standard startup term sheets explicitly state that the company cannot prepay the notes without the prior written consent of the noteholders. 2. Strategic Use for Founders Avoiding Dilution: Founders may seek the right to prepay if the company becomes unexpectedly profitable or has access to cheaper capital. By repaying the loan in cash, they avoid the \"unfavorable terms\" of conversion that would dilute their ownership. Clean-Up: Prepayment can be used to \"clean up\" a cap table by removing small debt holders before a new institutional investor comes on board. 3. Automatic Repayment Events Prepayment can sometimes be triggered automatically by specific \"Events of Default\" or corporate changes, rather than a voluntary choice by the company: Insolvency: Legal requirements may force repayment if the company enters bankruptcy. Change of Control: If the company is acquired, notes may be paid off immediately in cash rather than converted, depending on the agreed terms. Material Breach: Failure to follow the agreed-upon negative covenants can trigger immediate repayment. 4. Valuation Implications In financial modeling, the \"callability\" (the issuer's right to prepay) reduces the fair value of the note for the investor. If a note is \"called\" for prepayment, the holder usually has a final window to choose between accepting the cash prepayment or exercising their conversion right to shares.",

Small data centres use from 5k to 15kt ... So how many data centres are being built globally? Analysts project massive global expansion, with some expecting over 2,000 new data centers built by 2030. The the mid point of 10-15kt and that's around 25mt of copper required just for data centres over the next 4-5 years. Escondido the world's largest copper mine - by orders of magnitude - produces 1.4mt annually - it's like 2x bigger than the next top 10 mines (all about 0.5mt each) add up to around 6-7 mt per annum - production... Global copper production was around 23 million metric tons (MT) in 2024, with Chile leading by far (5.3 MT, 23%) Never mind the electricity gap... But what about the copper gap? Planned hyper scale and global data centres alone will use circa 10-20% of global copper supply. What about everything else? EV - is the biggest rising demand , extending replacing ageing power grid networks, general construction wiring, military demand, developing world - ie virgin demand - in Africa, India and booming South East Asia It's like trying to squeeze the contents of the Hoover dam through a garden hose. We need to find and build another 5-8 Escondidas in the next 6 years. OR / AND price has to rise a lot.\u201c Trek",

The historic Empire underground mine, located beneath the surface of the Company's proposed open pit, boasts a rich history of producing high-grade copper, gold, silver, zinc, and tungsten.\nSince 2017,\u00a0Phoenix\u00a0has executed extensive drilling initiatives, resulting in an expansion of the Empire Open-Pit resource by over 200%. In\u00a0May 2024\u00a0the Company published its inaugural mineral reserve statement for the\u00a0Empire Open-Pit Mine. Proven and Probable mineral reserves are 10.1 million tonnes containing 109,487,970 lbs of copper, 104,000 oz of gold and 4,654,400 oz of silver. This reserve was estimated using assay data from 485 drill holes, extensive geological modelling, metallurgical recovery test work, geotechnical evaluation, and mine design. The reserve represents a combined 66,467 tonnes of copper equivalent metal.\nIn addition to the\u00a0Empire Mine,\u00a0Phoenix's\u00a0holdings in the district also encompass the Horseshoe, White Knob, and Blue\u00a0Bird Mines, all of which have been producers of copper, gold, silver, zinc, lead, and tungsten from underground operations, a new high-grade silver and lead orebody at\u00a0Red Star, and the\u00a0Navarre Creek\u00a0gold exploration project, which was first drilled in 2023. The Company's land package at Empire spans 8,434 acres (34 sq km).\nPhoenix\u00a0also owns two cobalt properties situated along the Idaho Cobalt Belt to the north of Empire. An Earn-In Agreement has been established concerning one of these properties.\nPhoenix\u00a0is listed on\u00a0London's\u00a0AIM (PXC), and trades on\u00a0New York's\u00a0OTCQX Market (PXCLF and PXCLY (ADRs)).

The point regarding running two CLN\u2019s at the same time, I\u2019m not sure I follow that argument.  Whilst it seems clear to me (brought about by the action of Riverfort potentially claiming prepayment fees from PXC for early redemption of Riverfort CLN\u2019s) that Riverfort was not consulted, or even aware of, the early redemption of the Riverfort CLN\u2019s, it does appear that PXC used the funds incoming from Indigo to prepay the Riverfort CLN\u2019s, in which case, there would not have been two separate CLN\u2019s (one from Riverfort and the other from Indigo) running in tandem at the same time. I do think, however, that the claim that NIU and/or Indigo might have against PXC for paying Riverfort as a preference in a situation where PXC was knowingly operating insolvently, has some legs.  Even if the case is weak, what it does do is block any additional sources of funding coming in to the business, and gives Indigo and NIU the whip hand at the negotiating table. GLA",

We don't even know the true number of shares that have been issued because they already had form for late reporting and now any claim originating from CFO is under deep scrutiny. I don't know how anyone could unpick this to arrive at a valuation above zero. I am amazed the Nomad has allowed this to continue to trade.

Unlike Forcella, I\u2019m really not convinced that Indigo will convert any more CLN\u2019s now knowing that there are Governance, solvency and management issues at PXC.  Is it worth the risk of damaging its reputation with its clients any more than it already has done on PXC, by converting potentially up to another $500,000 worth of CLN\u2019s at a VWAP of say 1p, for stock that could be worth $0 at some point in time in the near future, and most importantly, with no sign of development funding or cash runway beyond end Q2 on the table? Rightly so, there\u2019ll be a serious amount of concern and no doubt, scrutiny at Indigo Capital over the validity of the representations made by PXC when this funding was put in place in December 2025.

It\u2019s highly doubtful that converting more CLN\u2019s at this stage makes any sense to them.  Converting a quarter of the value of its CLN\u2019s on 23rd January 2026 at 1.48p, less than two weeks ago, and subsequently having sold those converted shares to Private Equity/family office clients at a margin on 1.48p has already blown up in their face, with PXC, within two weeks of those deals, announcing financial irregularities and a whole host of governance issues that will lead off the back of it.

          "content": "Magmanus_49\u2026 \u201cThe focus now shifts to execution: appointing a new CFO, securing short- and long-term financing, and stabilising operations. Importantly, these financing discussions were already referenced in the January 2025 update, when the share price was around 2\u20133p \u2014 a level that already appeared oversold at the time.\u201d Some of what the new CFO will be challenged with early on in this process include: Indigo Capital will undoubtedly be looking closely at what and when certain things occurred in the time leading up to Indigo confirming funding to PXC, and asking questions as to whether any misrepresentation to Indigo occurred.  Did PXC know, or reasonably ought to have known of the misconduct, or any other disclosable matter before December 2025; and if so, would Indigo have invested at all if it had known of the misconduct prior to lending? Payment to Riverfort deemed as a \u2018preference\u2019.  There has to be a question from Indigo Capital, and on the same basis, NIU, regarding the context and timing of the raising of the funds by PXC from Indigo, and the repayment/prepayment of Riverfort with those funds raised from Indigo.  At the time of the payment to Riverfort, was PXC knowingly trading in cash flow insolvency? If Indigo and/or NIU can argue that PXC was technically insolvent at the time that it repaid Riverfort, either or both of them would have good grounds to argue that PXC has given preference to Riverfort in its payment to it as a creditor. These factors are material issues to PXC as BOD\u2019s, and to any potential future funder/investors at this time.  Of course Indigo and NIU are going to be asking these questions of PXC at this time, looking for ways to secure their positions as best they can.  It would be naive of anyone investing in PXC not to consider this is the situation. The ramifications are that it: (a) slows any new funding down essentially to a halt, unless or until questions including misreps and preference questions have been satisfactorily answered to the positive; and (b) open the question that if Indigo were misrepresented by PXC, will Indigo rescind the current financing; and (c) opens the question that if Indigo and/or NIU can argue that PXC was technically insolvent at the time that it repaid/prepaid Riverfort whether that payment be recalled to PXC, as it was deemed to be paid in preference over other creditors?

There\u2019s going to be a short period of having to unpick the mess we\u2019ve been left in, and then shake the vultures off. No doubt this will come at a price, but it\u2019s survivable. The company can then have a clean slate to progress the larger financing. It\u2019s almost certain that previous finance discussions have fallen by the wayside because Wilkins and Edwards-Jones were perceived as untrustworthy sheisters. Ryan McDermott comes across as different, and anyone that\u2019s met him at AGM\u2019s would say the same. It\u2019s just not been his company to run all these years despite being CEO because everything went through Wilkins. He\u2019s now the proper frontman. They\u2019ll be no more wild statements or speculation in RNS\u2019s, which is why he likely didn\u2019t mention the US investor today. It happens when it happens, and then we\u2019ll be told. There\u2019s still a viable company here, and while we\u2019re likely to suffer dilution to clear the vultures out, I\u2019d expect a far more sensible finance package to be put in place and the bonds finally kicked to the curb.",

          "content": "Thanks \u2014 yes, I meant the CFO and Chairman. The removal of two senior executives should be viewed in context. Given the company\u2019s underlying assets, it\u2019s difficult to justify a market cap below \u00a33m, yet that\u2019s where the stock is currently trading. This disconnect highlights just how oversold the situation has become. The shares were already heavily de-rated from around 6p at the start of the year, so the additional ~50% drop following decisive board action feels excessive rather than fundamental. In reality, markets tend to reward strong governance and transparency, especially when issues are confronted rather than ignored. Existing shareholders \u2014 and new buyers \u2014 generally value that approach. It\u2019s also worth noting that there are AIM shell companies with no meaningful assets trading at valuations above \u00a33m. Against that backdrop, PXC\u2019s valuation looks increasingly disconnected from reality. The focus now shifts to execution: appointing a new CFO, securing short- and long-term financing, and stabilising operations. Importantly, these financing discussions were already referenced in the January 2025 update, when the share price was around 2\u20133p \u2014 a level that already appeared oversold at the time. With hindsight, it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the board changes announced recently had been in progress for some time, potentially explaining the prolonged weakness in the share price. With those issues now addressed, the stock finally has a chance to reset and re-rate from deeply depressed levels. In short, this looks less like a business impairment and more like capitulation pricing driven by uncertainty \u2014 uncertainty that is now being actively resolved.",

If you or I were on the board, adding a little more skin may give confidence and also draw in more or keep others from abandoning the ship. Perhaps directors would also be aware such an action will then ensure a very lucrative salary by dragging this out for a few more years, then if such. it would be money well spent. Also, seems odd that a British group have discovered what is deemed significant wealth in the USA that was oblivious to the Americans. This seems unlikely and open to questions as to why they never researched the potential themselves being hardly short of hi tech, local knowledge, money etc. Also, should the Brits have discovered what was under the Americans noses, then I wonder that if it is a good as they say it is, the Americans will throw as many obstacles in the way to ensue that they pressure the group to breaking point and keep all profits for themselves, by hampering loans, by imposing rules and laws to ensure that extraction is as costly and long winded as feasible to then get the company bought out for a song as they run out of money waiting. So I hope that all the above is just irrational fear, but after seeing the share price plunge from many multiples of it's current price, still wonder if my gut feeling was correct. Whilst PM's and Copper may have risen dramatically, unless having any to sell, not in tiny fragments buried withing millions of tons of rock and earth, then the costs are growing but the income is still non existent. Debt is expensive and more so the longer this is dragged out. My gold Sov is worth \u00a3800 ish, but should I choose to grind it into tiny fragments, placing each fragment in a lump of rock, and scatter those rocks over acres and bury it under tons more debris, I doubt you would give me a pound for the license to find it, despite 'certainty it is out there' especially if you had to jump through lengthy hoops to obtain permission and to gain the funds from others when more interested parties to extract the wealth can pull strings harder. I guess if the new skin is because the board feel certain or more confident funding is coming soon, then we will all be happy and singing from the same hymn sheet, juries out until then from me. Re posted as at the time, when I questioned the motive of the board buying more, I was just insulted so seems I was right, their skin in the game counts for nothing.  Likely the Americans will snap it up on the cheap after toying with the dim limey's, who in turn have used shareholders cash to ensure a good few years of lucrative salaries and perhaps more invisible earnings.",

I\u2019ve been calling for the CFO to go for a long time - probably around September 2024 when he hid NIU hadn\u2019t allowed them to draw down the bonds as per the schedule they\u2019d communicated halfway down the interims. Then did an interview post market saying there was no problem with bond investor and that he saw this as a billion pound company. Likewise the Chairman should\u2019ve fallen on his sword long ago, it\u2019s been clear he\u2019s not had the contacts/competence to sell these bonds to anyone other than NIU who mugged him here and at his other gig at CRTM. This was on the telegram group which i\u2019m no longer a member of but i\u2019m sure someone can vouch. So no i\u2019d have got rid ages ago, and it\u2019s not come as a surprise they\u2019re alleged of being bent however it\u2019s too little too late at 1p and \u00a32.7m market cap. To answer your question what\u2019s changed in the last month: - It became clear that it took them 6 weeks to notify Indigo had converted at 1.48p. - That the board potentially bought shares so Indigo had volume to convert and sell into. The SP then pumped to 3p on the back of director buys. - It became apparent that the clowns in charge paid off Riverfort with the Indigo CLN without checking the terms of it and now may have a prepayment penalty liability of $109k (which they don\u2019t have) - The two in charge of finance are being investigated for being corrupt. - Gold up 10% - Copper price flat - PXC down 65% That\u2019s what\u2019s changed. I\u2019ve answered your question so perhaps you can answer all the ones in my previous post? Cheers.",

Enjoy: Strategic Report: Phoenix Copper (PXC.L) Liquidity Assessment The investment case for Phoenix Copper is now in a state of terminal duress following the suspension of its Executive Chairman and CFO on February 9, 2026. With the share price collapsing to 0.95p, the market is pricing in a high probability of insolvency or a dilutive restructuring that will effectively wipe out current equity holders. Break-Up Value & Assets The theoretical \"Break-Up\" value is based on the Empire Mine (8,434 acres in Idaho). The 2024 Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS) estimated a pre-tax Net Present Value (NPV) of $252 million, implying an asset-backed value of roughly 24p per share. However, in a distressed liquidation, this paper value serves as a ceiling for creditors, not a floor for shareholders. Secured lenders, led by Riverfort Global Opportunities, would likely seize the physical assets (land and equipment already staged in Idaho). For common shareholders, the recovery value in a fire sale is estimated at near-zero. Likelihood of Funding & Investors The probability of securing the proposed $75 million corporate bond has fallen to 15%. The ongoing \"conduct investigation\" makes the company un-investable for new institutional capital. The most likely source of survival capital is a \"predatory\" bridge loan from Riverfort or a distress-focused investor like NIU Invest (~45% probability). These investors typically utilize \"death spiral\" financing, converting debt into equity at massive discounts, which would further crush the share price. Rating: SELL / DURESS The stock is a \"Value Trap.\" While the land is worth 24p, the 8-week cash runway and management vacuum suggest a total loss of capital is the most probable outcome.",

That's to keep the lights on... NIU have security over the Empire mine... they can't sell it to pay them their $5m back, it goes to NIU if they default. How do they pay any fees associated with selling the $75m worth of bonds needed -  advisers, finders fees etc.? Confetti, and lots of it. That's if it doesn't go into admin which is the most likely scenario imo.",

Pretty much, ever since the NIU Bond deal went sour, and Cu and Au prices have continued to appreciate in value, we have been asking that very same question throughout that time.

I just don\u2019t think that the BOD\u2019s have been straight-up about the reason, but we are getting to the point where news will (have to) break, especially with this latest news coming out of the Company that puts its corporate governance credentials well and truly under the microscope.

          "content": "Thanks \u2014 yes, I meant the CFO and Chairman. The removal of two senior executives should be viewed in context. Given the company\u2019s underlying assets, it\u2019s difficult to justify a market cap below \u00a33m, yet that\u2019s where the stock is currently trading. This disconnect highlights just how oversold the situation has become. The shares were already heavily de-rated from around 6p at the start of the year, so the additional ~50% drop following decisive board action feels excessive rather than fundamental. In reality, markets tend to reward strong governance and transparency, especially when issues are confronted rather than ignored. Existing shareholders \u2014 and new buyers \u2014 generally value that approach. It\u2019s also worth noting that there are AIM shell companies with no meaningful assets trading at valuations above \u00a33m. Against that backdrop, PXC\u2019s valuation looks increasingly disconnected from reality. The focus now shifts to execution: appointing a new CFO, securing short- and long-term financing, and stabilising operations. Importantly, these financing discussions were already referenced in the January 2025 update, when the share price was around 2\u20133p \u2014 a level that already appeared oversold at the time. With hindsight, it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the board changes announced recently had been in progress for some time, potentially explaining the prolonged weakness in the share price. With those issues now addressed, the stock finally has a chance to reset and re-rate from deeply depressed levels. In short, this looks less like a business impairment and more like capitulation pricing driven by uncertainty \u2014 uncertainty that is now being actively resolved.",

If you or I were on the board, adding a little more skin may give confidence and also draw in more or keep others from abandoning the ship. Perhaps directors would also be aware such an action will then ensure a very lucrative salary by dragging this out for a few more years, then if such. it would be money well spent. Also, seems odd that a British group have discovered what is deemed significant wealth in the USA that was oblivious to the Americans. This seems unlikely and open to questions as to why they never researched the potential themselves being hardly short of hi tech, local knowledge, money etc. Also, should the Brits have discovered what was under the Americans noses, then I wonder that if it is a good as they say it is, the Americans will throw as many obstacles in the way to ensue that they pressure the group to breaking point and keep all profits for themselves, by hampering loans, by imposing rules and laws to ensure that extraction is as costly and long winded as feasible to then get the company bought out for a song as they run out of money waiting. So I hope that all the above is just irrational fear, but after seeing the share price plunge from many multiples of it's current price, still wonder if my gut feeling was correct. Whilst PM's and Copper may have risen dramatically, unless having any to sell, not in tiny fragments buried withing millions of tons of rock and earth, then the costs are growing but the income is still non existent. Debt is expensive and more so the longer this is dragged out. My gold Sov is worth \u00a3800 ish, but should I choose to grind it into tiny fragments, placing each fragment in a lump of rock, and scatter those rocks over acres and bury it under tons more debris, I doubt you would give me a pound for the license to find it, despite 'certainty it is out there' especially if you had to jump through lengthy hoops to obtain permission and to gain the funds from others when more interested parties to extract the wealth can pull strings harder. I guess if the new skin is because the board feel certain or more confident funding is coming soon, then we will all be happy and singing from the same hymn sheet, juries out until then from me. Re posted as at the time, when I questioned the motive of the board buying more, I was just insulted so seems I was right, their skin in the game counts for nothing.  Likely the Americans will snap it up on the cheap after toying with the dim limey's, who in turn have used shareholders cash to ensure a good few years of lucrative salaries and perhaps more invisible earnings.",

I\u2019ve been calling for the CFO to go for a long time - probably around September 2024 when he hid NIU hadn\u2019t allowed them to draw down the bonds as per the schedule they\u2019d communicated halfway down the interims. Then did an interview post market saying there was no problem with bond investor and that he saw this as a billion pound company. Likewise the Chairman should\u2019ve fallen on his sword long ago, it\u2019s been clear he\u2019s not had the contacts/competence to sell these bonds to anyone other than NIU who mugged him here and at his other gig at CRTM. This was on the telegram group which i\u2019m no longer a member of but i\u2019m sure someone can vouch. So no i\u2019d have got rid ages ago, and it\u2019s not come as a surprise they\u2019re alleged of being bent however it\u2019s too little too late at 1p and \u00a32.7m market cap. To answer your question what\u2019s changed in the last month: - It became clear that it took them 6 weeks to notify Indigo had converted at 1.48p. - That the board potentially bought shares so Indigo had volume to convert and sell into. The SP then pumped to 3p on the back of director buys. - It became apparent that the clowns in charge paid off Riverfort with the Indigo CLN without checking the terms of it and now may have a prepayment penalty liability of $109k (which they don\u2019t have) - The two in charge of finance are being investigated for being corrupt. - Gold up 10% - Copper price flat - PXC down 65% That\u2019s what\u2019s changed. I\u2019ve answered your question so perhaps you can answer all the ones in my previous post? Cheers.",

          "content": "Hey BritishPec , I did my research and many thanks. Enjoy: Strategic Report: Phoenix Copper (PXC.L) Liquidity Assessment The investment case for Phoenix Copper is now in a state of terminal duress following the suspension of its Executive Chairman and CFO on February 9, 2026. With the share price collapsing to 0.95p, the market is pricing in a high probability of insolvency or a dilutive restructuring that will effectively wipe out current equity holders. Break-Up Value & Assets The theoretical \"Break-Up\" value is based on the Empire Mine (8,434 acres in Idaho). The 2024 Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS) estimated a pre-tax Net Present Value (NPV) of $252 million, implying an asset-backed value of roughly 24p per share. However, in a distressed liquidation, this paper value serves as a ceiling for creditors, not a floor for shareholders. Secured lenders, led by Riverfort Global Opportunities, would likely seize the physical assets (land and equipment already staged in Idaho). For common shareholders, the recovery value in a fire sale is estimated at near-zero. Likelihood of Funding & Investors The probability of securing the proposed $75 million corporate bond has fallen to 15%. The ongoing \"conduct investigation\" makes the company un-investable for new institutional capital. The most likely source of survival capital is a \"predatory\" bridge loan from Riverfort or a distress-focused investor like NIU Invest (~45% probability). These investors typically utilize \"death spiral\" financing, converting debt into equity at massive discounts, which would further crush the share price. Rating: SELL / DURESS The stock is a \"Value Trap.\" While the land is worth 24p, the 8-week cash runway and management vacuum suggest a total loss of capital is the most probable outcome.",

That's to keep the lights on... NIU have security over the Empire mine... they can't sell it to pay them their $5m back, it goes to NIU if they default. How do they pay any fees associated with selling the $75m worth of bonds needed -  advisers, finders fees etc.? Confetti, and lots of it. That's if it doesn't go into admin which is the most likely scenario imo.",

Pretty much, ever since the NIU Bond deal went sour, and Cu and Au prices have continued to appreciate in value, we have been asking that very same question throughout that time.

At the current rate of progress on either of those scenarios, perhaps more likely would be some form of an insolvency event occurring on PXC.",

Application has been made for the New Ordinary Shares to be admitted to trading on AIM (\"Admission\").

The Company has been informed that Indigo has entered into agreements to divest 24,181,814 of the New Ordinary Shares to various equity funds and family offices in Europe and elsewhere, as soon as practicable following Admission. Following Admission, the Company will have 287,995,114 ordinary shares outstanding.

In the context of early-stage startup financing, prepayment is a highly sensitive and often restricted term for the following reasons: 1. Investor Resistance Loss of Upside: Investors generally oppose prepayment clauses because they want the option to convert their debt into high-value equity. If a company prepays the loan just before a major funding round or exit, the investor loses the \"upside\" of converting at a discount or under a valuation cap. \"No Prepayment\" Clauses: Most standard startup term sheets explicitly state that the company cannot prepay the notes without the prior written consent of the noteholders. 2. Strategic Use for Founders Avoiding Dilution: Founders may seek the right to prepay if the company becomes unexpectedly profitable or has access to cheaper capital. By repaying the loan in cash, they avoid the \"unfavorable terms\" of conversion that would dilute their ownership. Clean-Up: Prepayment can be used to \"clean up\" a cap table by removing small debt holders before a new institutional investor comes on board. 3. Automatic Repayment Events Prepayment can sometimes be triggered automatically by specific \"Events of Default\" or corporate changes, rather than a voluntary choice by the company: Insolvency: Legal requirements may force repayment if the company enters bankruptcy. Change of Control: If the company is acquired, notes may be paid off immediately in cash rather than converted, depending on the agreed terms. Material Breach: Failure to follow the agreed-upon negative covenants can trigger immediate repayment. 4. Valuation Implications In financial modeling, the \"callability\" (the issuer's right to prepay) reduces the fair value of the note for the investor. If a note is \"called\" for prepayment, the holder usually has a final window to choose between accepting the cash prepayment or exercising their conversion right to shares.",

Small data centres use from 5k to 15kt ... So how many data centres are being built globally? Analysts project massive global expansion, with some expecting over 2,000 new data centers built by 2030. The the mid point of 10-15kt and that's around 25mt of copper required just for data centres over the next 4-5 years. Escondido the world's largest copper mine - by orders of magnitude - produces 1.4mt annually - it's like 2x bigger than the next top 10 mines (all about 0.5mt each) add up to around 6-7 mt per annum - production... Global copper production was around 23 million metric tons (MT) in 2024, with Chile leading by far (5.3 MT, 23%) Never mind the electricity gap... But what about the copper gap? Planned hyper scale and global data centres alone will use circa 10-20% of global copper supply. What about everything else? EV - is the biggest rising demand , extending replacing ageing power grid networks, general construction wiring, military demand, developing world - ie virgin demand - in Africa, India and booming South East Asia It's like trying to squeeze the contents of the Hoover dam through a garden hose. We need to find and build another 5-8 Escondidas in the next 6 years. OR / AND price has to rise a lot.\u201c Trek",

          "content": "MT\u2026 so a topic of conversation on this and other BB\u2019s at the time that NIU bond deal went sour, was the question of whether PXC could use Bond capital to pay down the coupon.  In usual circumstances, where capital is raised as development capital (which in this case, it was) there will invariably be a clause in the contract prohibiting the use of the capital for P and L expenditure, which, by its definition, includes the servicing of the coupon.  The prohibition on coupon servicing will probably have been specific in the contract aswell.  Given where the NAV for Empire is, give NIU any opportunity to foreclose on it for the \u00a35m it is in for, and it will take it, no question.  Any breach of duty, contract or performance under the terms of the NIU deal will automatically be terminal for PXC. The LOI was specifically a non-binding LOI, so no legal standing.  Plus I highly doubt that Indigo has anything to do with the Investor.  The situation is that in 2024, PXC entered into its original arrangement with Riverfort to provide working capital for PXC in a deal that was very favourable to PXC, but contingent on PXC securing at least $25m from a bond raise, for PXC to benefit from those favourable terms.  With the NIU deal in 2024, it appeared to everyone that PXC had pulled it off and delivered on the Riverfort condition, only then for NIU to pull out.  It left PXC in 2025 having to draw down additional funds on the Riverfort deal, but the cash costs and fees were just too punitive to continue with Riverfort on that basis whilst they waited for the bond deal to arrive, which of course it hasn\u2019t. The Indigo deal at the end of 2025 was concluded because it was cheaper to service month to month, which matters when you\u2019re trying to survive to the next funding event, but it has come with a greater dilutive effect upon shareholders.  It was probably the right thing to do.  It\u2019s possible that the Directors that are now suspended may have \u201ctaken one for the team\u201d by doing what they have done, although at this stage it\u2019s difficult to say with any certainty whether that is the situation. The most sensible solution for the Company right now will be to get into a room with Indigo, to establish how it can structure something around a settlement with Riverfort, and that will ensure that the Company does not default on the payment of the Coupon to NIU.  That is going to come at a cost to shareholders.  Sub-1p incoming I envisage. GLA GLA.",

          "content": "MTSparky Three fundamentals here to unpack\u2026 First is the position of Indigo Capital.  Did the Company make misrepresentations to Indigo in securing funding in December 2025? If it did, Indigo could claim that it never would have made the funding in the first place had it known of the Company\u2019s actual state of affairs.  Solid grounds for rescission? Probably Indigo\u2019s strongest claim, which will also give them options in how they feature in where this goes from here. Second, is the position of Riverfort, and the early repayment of the Riverfort Debt.  The legality of that is challengable on all sorts of different levels.  On one of those, Riverfort has fought its way back into the picture, alongside Indigo, on a contractual point regarding prepayment.  Riverfort might have grounds to argue the opposite of Indigo, that it intended to exercise the CLN\u2019s and would have done had PXC given prior notice of its intention to prepay.   I\u2019m also not sure that the Company was in a position to repay Riverfort the whole sum due. Given the indebtedness of the Company,  given the Company\u2019s known solvency position at the time that it repaid the sum, there\u2019s a fair argument to say that a repayment in full to Riverfort was disproportionate and the repayment constituted a preference, when the Company was trading insolvently. Third, is the position of NIU.  NIU\u2019s \u00a35m debt is secured over the Empire assets.  Is PXC maintaining its coupon payments to NIU or is PXC in breach?  I can only assume (and hope) that the coupon payments are being properly maintained.  The moment that they are not, NIU will have the power to foreclose on the Empire assets, assuming that Konnex Resources Inc, is included in the schedule of \u2018Group\u2019 Companies on which NIU took security from PXC.  At this juncture, it appears that NIU is in the box seats IMO.  It has options at its disposal in the event of a default of PXC\u2019s payment of the coupon.  It also has a potential claim regarding repayment to Riverfort being a \u2018preference\u2019, if it chooses not to/can\u2019t foreclose. It\u2019s game over for Riverfort, Indigo (and of course PXC) if NIU foreclose on Empire, so it is in the interests of Riverfort and Indigo to get into dialogue with PXC in how it can ensure that PXC stays alive.  It could be the golden ticket that PXC can use to buy itself a lifeline from either/both Riverfort/Indigo to get out of the mess PXC finds itself in. Fourth, any new institutional money coming in to salvage PXC is highly unlikely; PXC is a red flag unless or until the decks are cleared governance-wise and that\u2019s not going to happen in the time that it will take before PXC\u2019s cash runs dry. Fifth is the undisclosed investor.  If he is savvy enough and well-advised as I think, he would be doing exactly what he\u2019s done: he\u2019s got close enough to the action to find out what\u2019s going on, and has held off long enough to allow all the excrement from the PXC barrel to float to the surface.

The point regarding running two CLN\u2019s at the same time, I\u2019m not sure I follow that argument.  Whilst it seems clear to me (brought about by the action of Riverfort potentially claiming prepayment fees from PXC for early redemption of Riverfort CLN\u2019s) that Riverfort was not consulted, or even aware of, the early redemption of the Riverfort CLN\u2019s, it does appear that PXC used the funds incoming from Indigo to prepay the Riverfort CLN\u2019s, in which case, there would not have been two separate CLN\u2019s (one from Riverfort and the other from Indigo) running in tandem at the same time. I do think, however, that the claim that NIU and/or Indigo might have against PXC for paying Riverfort as a preference in a situation where PXC was knowingly operating insolvently, has some legs.  Even if the case is weak, what it does do is block any additional sources of funding coming in to the business, and gives Indigo and NIU the whip hand at the negotiating table. GLA",

It would be bad enough if there was just one CLN but that there were two effectively running concurrently, with both creditors apparently unaware of the extent of the others lending. We don't even know the true number of shares that have been issued because they already had form for late reporting and now any claim originating from CFO is under deep scrutiny. I don't know how anyone could unpick this to arrive at a valuation above zero. I am amazed the Nomad has allowed this to continue to trade.

Is it worth the risk of damaging its reputation with its clients any more than it already has done on PXC, by converting potentially up to another $500,000 worth of CLN\u2019s at a VWAP of say 1p, for stock that could be worth $0 at some point in time in the near future, and most importantly, with no sign of development funding or cash runway beyond end Q2 on the table?

Importantly, these financing discussions were already referenced in the January 2025 update, when the share price was around 2\u20133p \u2014 a level that already appeared oversold at the time.\u201d Some of what the new CFO will be challenged with early on in this process include: Indigo Capital will undoubtedly be looking closely at what and when certain things occurred in the time leading up to Indigo confirming funding to PXC, and asking questions as to whether any misrepresentation to Indigo occurred.  Did PXC know, or reasonably ought to have known of the misconduct, or any other disclosable matter before December 2025; and if so, would Indigo have invested at all if it had known of the misconduct prior to lending? Payment to Riverfort deemed as a \u2018preference\u2019.  There has to be a question from Indigo Capital, and on the same basis, NIU, regarding the context and timing of the raising of the funds by PXC from Indigo, and the repayment/prepayment of Riverfort with those funds raised from Indigo.  At the time of the payment to Riverfort, was PXC knowingly trading in cash flow insolvency? If Indigo and/or NIU can argue that PXC was technically insolvent at the time that it repaid Riverfort, either or both of them would have good grounds to argue that PXC has given preference to Riverfort in its payment to it as a creditor. These factors are material issues to PXC as BOD\u2019s, and to any potential future funder/investors at this time.  Of course Indigo and NIU are going to be asking these questions of PXC at this time, looking for ways to secure their positions as best they can.  It would be naive of anyone investing in PXC not to consider this is the situation. The ramifications are that it: (a) slows any new funding down essentially to a halt, unless or until questions including misreps and preference questions have been satisfactorily answered to the positive; and (b) open the question that if Indigo were misrepresented by PXC, will Indigo rescind the current financing; and (c) opens the question that if Indigo and/or NIU can argue that PXC was technically insolvent at the time that it repaid/prepaid Riverfort whether that payment be recalled to PXC, as it was deemed to be paid in preference over other creditors?

The company can then have a clean slate to progress the larger financing. It\u2019s almost certain that previous finance discussions have fallen by the wayside because Wilkins and Edwards-Jones were perceived as untrustworthy sheisters. Ryan McDermott comes across as different, and anyone that\u2019s met him at AGM\u2019s would say the same. It\u2019s just not been his company to run all these years despite being CEO because everything went through Wilkins. He\u2019s now the proper frontman. They\u2019ll be no more wild statements or speculation in RNS\u2019s, which is why he likely didn\u2019t mention the US investor today. It happens when it happens, and then we\u2019ll be told.

The point regarding running two CLN\u2019s at the same time, I\u2019m not sure I follow that argument.  Whilst it seems clear to me (brought about by the action of Riverfort potentially claiming prepayment fees from PXC for early redemption of Riverfort CLN\u2019s) that Riverfort was not consulted, or even aware of, the early redemption of the Riverfort CLN\u2019s, it does appear that PXC used the funds incoming from Indigo to prepay the Riverfort CLN\u2019s, in which case, there would not have been two separate CLN\u2019s (one from Riverfort and the other from Indigo) running in tandem at the same time. I do think, however, that the claim that NIU and/or Indigo might have against PXC for paying Riverfort as a preference in a situation where PXC was knowingly operating insolvently, has some legs.  Even if the case is weak, what it does do is block any additional sources of funding coming in to the business, and gives Indigo and NIU the whip hand at the negotiating table. GLA",

It would be bad enough if there was just one CLN but that there were two effectively running concurrently, with both creditors apparently unaware of the extent of the others lending. We don't even know the true number of shares that have been issued because they already had form for late reporting and now any claim originating from CFO is under deep scrutiny. I don't know how anyone could unpick this to arrive at a valuation above zero. I am amazed the Nomad has allowed this to continue to trade. Even if this does miraculously stagger on to full year accounts deadline, can you imagine an auditor signing any of this off?",

Unlike Forcella, I\u2019m really not convinced that Indigo will convert any more CLN\u2019s now knowing that there are Governance, solvency and management issues at PXC.  Is it worth the risk of damaging its reputation with its clients any more than it already has done on PXC, by converting potentially up to another $500,000 worth of CLN\u2019s at a VWAP of say 1p, for stock that could be worth $0 at some point in time in the near future, and most importantly, with no sign of development funding or cash runway beyond end Q2 on the table? Rightly so, there\u2019ll be a serious amount of concern and no doubt, scrutiny at Indigo Capital over the validity of the representations made by PXC when this funding was put in place in December 2025.

Importantly, these financing discussions were already referenced in the January 2025 update, when the share price was around 2\u20133p \u2014 a level that already appeared oversold at the time.\u201d Some of what the new CFO will be challenged with early on in this process include: Indigo Capital will undoubtedly be looking closely at what and when certain things occurred in the time leading up to Indigo confirming funding to PXC, and asking questions as to whether any misrepresentation to Indigo occurred.  Did PXC know, or reasonably ought to have known of the misconduct, or any other disclosable matter before December 2025; and if so, would Indigo have invested at all if it had known of the misconduct prior to lending? Payment to Riverfort deemed as a \u2018preference\u2019.  There has to be a question from Indigo Capital, and on the same basis, NIU, regarding the context and timing of the raising of the funds by PXC from Indigo, and the repayment/prepayment of Riverfort with those funds raised from Indigo.  At the time of the payment to Riverfort, was PXC knowingly trading in cash flow insolvency? If Indigo and/or NIU can argue that PXC was technically insolvent at the time that it repaid Riverfort, either or both of them would have good grounds to argue that PXC has given preference to Riverfort in its payment to it as a creditor. These factors are material issues to PXC as BOD\u2019s, and to any potential future funder/investors at this time.  Of course Indigo and NIU are going to be asking these questions of PXC at this time, looking for ways to secure their positions as best they can.  It would be naive of anyone investing in PXC not to consider this is the situation. The ramifications are that it: (a) slows any new funding down essentially to a halt, unless or until questions including misreps and preference questions have been satisfactorily answered to the positive; and (b) open the question that if Indigo were misrepresented by PXC, will Indigo rescind the current financing; and (c) opens the question that if Indigo and/or NIU can argue that PXC was technically insolvent at the time that it repaid/prepaid Riverfort whether that payment be recalled to PXC, as it was deemed to be paid in preference over other creditors?

Given the company\u2019s underlying assets, it\u2019s difficult to justify a market cap below \u00a33m, yet that\u2019s where the stock is currently trading. This disconnect highlights just how oversold the situation has become. The shares were already heavily de-rated from around 6p at the start of the year, so the additional ~50% drop following decisive board action feels excessive rather than fundamental. In reality, markets tend to reward strong governance and transparency, especially when issues are confronted rather than ignored. Existing shareholders \u2014 and new buyers \u2014 generally value that approach. It\u2019s also worth noting that there are AIM shell companies with no meaningful assets trading at valuations above \u00a33m. Against that backdrop, PXC\u2019s valuation looks increasingly disconnected from reality. The focus now shifts to execution: appointing a new CFO, securing short- and long-term financing, and stabilising operations. Importantly, these financing discussions were already referenced in the January 2025 update, when the share price was around 2\u20133p \u2014 a level that already appeared oversold at the time. With hindsight, it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the board changes announced recently had been in progress for some time, potentially explaining the prolonged weakness in the share price. With those issues now addressed, the stock finally has a chance to reset and re-rate from deeply depressed levels. In short, this looks less like a business impairment and more like capitulation pricing driven by uncertainty \u2014 uncertainty that is now being actively resolved.",

If you or I were on the board, adding a little more skin may give confidence and also draw in more or keep others from abandoning the ship. Perhaps directors would also be aware such an action will then ensure a very lucrative salary by dragging this out for a few more years, then if such. it would be money well spent. Also, seems odd that a British group have discovered what is deemed significant wealth in the USA that was oblivious to the Americans. This seems unlikely and open to questions as to why they never researched the potential themselves being hardly short of hi tech, local knowledge, money etc. Also, should the Brits have discovered what was under the Americans noses, then I wonder that if it is a good as they say it is, the Americans will throw as many obstacles in the way to ensue that they pressure the group to breaking point and keep all profits for themselves, by hampering loans, by imposing rules and laws to ensure that extraction is as costly and long winded as feasible to then get the company bought out for a song as they run out of money waiting. So I hope that all the above is just irrational fear, but after seeing the share price plunge from many multiples of it's current price, still wonder if my gut feeling was correct. Whilst PM's and Copper may have risen dramatically, unless having any to sell, not in tiny fragments buried withing millions of tons of rock and earth, then the costs are growing but the income is still non existent. Debt is expensive and more so the longer this is dragged out. My gold Sov is worth \u00a3800 ish, but should I choose to grind it into tiny fragments, placing each fragment in a lump of rock, and scatter those rocks over acres and bury it under tons more debris, I doubt you would give me a pound for the license to find it, despite 'certainty it is out there' especially if you had to jump through lengthy hoops to obtain permission and to gain the funds from others when more interested parties to extract the wealth can pull strings harder. I guess if the new skin is because the board feel certain or more confident funding is coming soon, then we will all be happy and singing from the same hymn sheet, juries out until then from me. Re posted as at the time, when I questioned the motive of the board buying more, I was just insulted so seems I was right, their skin in the game counts for nothing.  Likely the Americans will snap it up on the cheap after toying with the dim limey's, who in turn have used shareholders cash to ensure a good few years of lucrative salaries and perhaps more invisible earnings.",

I\u2019ve been calling for the CFO to go for a long time - probably around September 2024 when he hid NIU hadn\u2019t allowed them to draw down the bonds as per the schedule they\u2019d communicated halfway down the interims. Then did an interview post market saying there was no problem with bond investor and that he saw this as a billion pound company. Likewise the Chairman should\u2019ve fallen on his sword long ago, it\u2019s been clear he\u2019s not had the contacts/competence to sell these bonds to anyone other than NIU who mugged him here and at his other gig at CRTM. This was on the telegram group which i\u2019m no longer a member of but i\u2019m sure someone can vouch. So no i\u2019d have got rid ages ago, and it\u2019s not come as a surprise they\u2019re alleged of being bent however it\u2019s too little too late at 1p and \u00a32.7m market cap. To answer your question what\u2019s changed in the last month: - It became clear that it took them 6 weeks to notify Indigo had converted at 1.48p. - That the board potentially bought shares so Indigo had volume to convert and sell into. The SP then pumped to 3p on the back of director buys. - It became apparent that the clowns in charge paid off Riverfort with the Indigo CLN without checking the terms of it and now may have a prepayment penalty liability of $109k (which they don\u2019t have) - The two in charge of finance are being investigated for being corrupt. - Gold up 10% - Copper price flat - PXC down 65% That\u2019s what\u2019s changed. I\u2019ve answered your question so perhaps you can answer all the ones in my previous post? Cheers.",

Enjoy: Strategic Report: Phoenix Copper (PXC.L) Liquidity Assessment The investment case for Phoenix Copper is now in a state of terminal duress following the suspension of its Executive Chairman and CFO on February 9, 2026. With the share price collapsing to 0.95p, the market is pricing in a high probability of insolvency or a dilutive restructuring that will effectively wipe out current equity holders. Break-Up Value & Assets The theoretical \"Break-Up\" value is based on the Empire Mine (8,434 acres in Idaho). The 2024 Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS) estimated a pre-tax Net Present Value (NPV) of $252 million, implying an asset-backed value of roughly 24p per share. However, in a distressed liquidation, this paper value serves as a ceiling for creditors, not a floor for shareholders. Secured lenders, led by Riverfort Global Opportunities, would likely seize the physical assets (land and equipment already staged in Idaho). For common shareholders, the recovery value in a fire sale is estimated at near-zero. Likelihood of Funding & Investors The probability of securing the proposed $75 million corporate bond has fallen to 15%. The ongoing \"conduct investigation\" makes the company un-investable for new institutional capital. The most likely source of survival capital is a \"predatory\" bridge loan from Riverfort or a distress-focused investor like NIU Invest (~45% probability). These investors typically utilize \"death spiral\" financing, converting debt into equity at massive discounts, which would further crush the share price. Rating: SELL / DURESS The stock is a \"Value Trap.\" While the land is worth 24p, the 8-week cash runway and management vacuum suggest a total loss of capital is the most probable outcome.",

That's to keep the lights on... NIU have security over the Empire mine... they can't sell it to pay them their $5m back, it goes to NIU if they default. How do they pay any fees associated with selling the $75m worth of bonds needed -  advisers, finders fees etc.? Confetti, and lots of it.

Given the company\u2019s underlying assets, it\u2019s difficult to justify a market cap below \u00a33m, yet that\u2019s where the stock is currently trading. This disconnect highlights just how oversold the situation has become. The shares were already heavily de-rated from around 6p at the start of the year, so the additional ~50% drop following decisive board action feels excessive rather than fundamental. In reality, markets tend to reward strong governance and transparency, especially when issues are confronted rather than ignored. Existing shareholders \u2014 and new buyers \u2014 generally value that approach. It\u2019s also worth noting that there are AIM shell companies with no meaningful assets trading at valuations above \u00a33m. Against that backdrop, PXC\u2019s valuation looks increasingly disconnected from reality. The focus now shifts to execution: appointing a new CFO, securing short- and long-term financing, and stabilising operations. Importantly, these financing discussions were already referenced in the January 2025 update, when the share price was around 2\u20133p \u2014 a level that already appeared oversold at the time. With hindsight, it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the board changes announced recently had been in progress for some time, potentially explaining the prolonged weakness in the share price. With those issues now addressed, the stock finally has a chance to reset and re-rate from deeply depressed levels. In short, this looks less like a business impairment and more like capitulation pricing driven by uncertainty \u2014 uncertainty that is now being actively resolved.",

If you or I were on the board, adding a little more skin may give confidence and also draw in more or keep others from abandoning the ship. Perhaps directors would also be aware such an action will then ensure a very lucrative salary by dragging this out for a few more years, then if such. it would be money well spent. Also, seems odd that a British group have discovered what is deemed significant wealth in the USA that was oblivious to the Americans. This seems unlikely and open to questions as to why they never researched the potential themselves being hardly short of hi tech, local knowledge, money etc. Also, should the Brits have discovered what was under the Americans noses, then I wonder that if it is a good as they say it is, the Americans will throw as many obstacles in the way to ensue that they pressure the group to breaking point and keep all profits for themselves, by hampering loans, by imposing rules and laws to ensure that extraction is as costly and long winded as feasible to then get the company bought out for a song as they run out of money waiting. So I hope that all the above is just irrational fear, but after seeing the share price plunge from many multiples of it's current price, still wonder if my gut feeling was correct. Whilst PM's and Copper may have risen dramatically, unless having any to sell, not in tiny fragments buried withing millions of tons of rock and earth, then the costs are growing but the income is still non existent. Debt is expensive and more so the longer this is dragged out. My gold Sov is worth \u00a3800 ish, but should I choose to grind it into tiny fragments, placing each fragment in a lump of rock, and scatter those rocks over acres and bury it under tons more debris, I doubt you would give me a pound for the license to find it, despite 'certainty it is out there' especially if you had to jump through lengthy hoops to obtain permission and to gain the funds from others when more interested parties to extract the wealth can pull strings harder. I guess if the new skin is because the board feel certain or more confident funding is coming soon, then we will all be happy and singing from the same hymn sheet, juries out until then from me. Re posted as at the time, when I questioned the motive of the board buying more, I was just insulted so seems I was right, their skin in the game counts for nothing.  Likely the Americans will snap it up on the cheap after toying with the dim limey's, who in turn have used shareholders cash to ensure a good few years of lucrative salaries and perhaps more invisible earnings.",

I\u2019ve been calling for the CFO to go for a long time - probably around September 2024 when he hid NIU hadn\u2019t allowed them to draw down the bonds as per the schedule they\u2019d communicated halfway down the interims. Then did an interview post market saying there was no problem with bond investor and that he saw this as a billion pound company. Likewise the Chairman should\u2019ve fallen on his sword long ago, it\u2019s been clear he\u2019s not had the contacts/competence to sell these bonds to anyone other than NIU who mugged him here and at his other gig at CRTM. This was on the telegram group which i\u2019m no longer a member of but i\u2019m sure someone can vouch. So no i\u2019d have got rid ages ago, and it\u2019s not come as a surprise they\u2019re alleged of being bent however it\u2019s too little too late at 1p and \u00a32.7m market cap. To answer your question what\u2019s changed in the last month: - It became clear that it took them 6 weeks to notify Indigo had converted at 1.48p. - That the board potentially bought shares so Indigo had volume to convert and sell into. The SP then pumped to 3p on the back of director buys. - It became apparent that the clowns in charge paid off Riverfort with the Indigo CLN without checking the terms of it and now may have a prepayment penalty liability of $109k (which they don\u2019t have) - The two in charge of finance are being investigated for being corrupt. - Gold up 10% - Copper price flat - PXC down 65% That\u2019s what\u2019s changed. I\u2019ve answered your question so perhaps you can answer all the ones in my previous post? Cheers.",

Enjoy: Strategic Report: Phoenix Copper (PXC.L) Liquidity Assessment The investment case for Phoenix Copper is now in a state of terminal duress following the suspension of its Executive Chairman and CFO on February 9, 2026. With the share price collapsing to 0.95p, the market is pricing in a high probability of insolvency or a dilutive restructuring that will effectively wipe out current equity holders. Break-Up Value & Assets The theoretical \"Break-Up\" value is based on the Empire Mine (8,434 acres in Idaho). The 2024 Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS) estimated a pre-tax Net Present Value (NPV) of $252 million, implying an asset-backed value of roughly 24p per share. However, in a distressed liquidation, this paper value serves as a ceiling for creditors, not a floor for shareholders. Secured lenders, led by Riverfort Global Opportunities, would likely seize the physical assets (land and equipment already staged in Idaho). For common shareholders, the recovery value in a fire sale is estimated at near-zero. Likelihood of Funding & Investors The probability of securing the proposed $75 million corporate bond has fallen to 15%. The ongoing \"conduct investigation\" makes the company un-investable for new institutional capital. The most likely source of survival capital is a \"predatory\" bridge loan from Riverfort or a distress-focused investor like NIU Invest (~45% probability). These investors typically utilize \"death spiral\" financing, converting debt into equity at massive discounts, which would further crush the share price. Rating: SELL / DURESS The stock is a \"Value Trap.\" While the land is worth 24p, the 8-week cash runway and management vacuum suggest a total loss of capital is the most probable outcome.",

That's to keep the lights on... NIU have security over the Empire mine... they can't sell it to pay them their $5m back, it goes to NIU if they default. How do they pay any fees associated with selling the $75m worth of bonds needed -  advisers, finders fees etc.? Confetti, and lots of it. That's if it doesn't go into admin which is the most likely scenario imo.",

In a copper, gold and silver boom, unlike any other, a US asset in all of this with the way the world is, it's incredible pxc has only been going down. Surely fortune has to flip.

Pretty much, ever since the NIU Bond deal went sour, and Cu and Au prices have continued to appreciate in value, we have been asking that very same question throughout that time. For me, there has to be a valid reason why PXC is still in the same hands today as it was 12 months ago.  I just don\u2019t think that the BOD\u2019s have been straight-up about the reason, but we are getting to the point where news will (have to) break, especially with this latest news coming out of the Company that puts its corporate governance credentials well and truly under the microscope.  If the external professional appointments sense there\u2019s something that should\u2019ve been disclosable that hasn\u2019t been, you\u2019ll see RNS\u2019s follow in short order to rectify the position in accordance with governance rules, or a resignation of the professional advisors if the Company refuses to rectify the disclosures required.

These two were destroying s/h value by doing side deals etc. Good riddance, Extremely positive. Second, mkt cap is below 3m now - very low based on asset values and commodity prices. Thirdly, nothing has changes with respect to financing position since last month when SP was 2.5p - this is intact and discussions on going, Simply - Oversold.   Knee Jerk reaction - happens.

The RNS on 23rd January 2026 states the most up-to-date sum of outstanding shares in the Company at a figure of 287,995,114. \u201cFurther to the announcement on 4 December 2025, the Company confirms that the CLN holder, Indigo, has converted $536,000 at 1.483 pence per share into 26,981,814 new ordinary shares of no par value in the Company (\"New Ordinary Shares\"). Application has been made for the New Ordinary Shares to be admitted to trading on AIM (\"Admission\"). It is expected that Admission will become effective and dealings will commence at 8:00 am on or around 26 January 2026. The Company has been informed that Indigo has entered into agreements to divest 24,181,814 of the New Ordinary Shares to various equity funds and family offices in Europe and elsewhere, as soon as practicable following Admission. Following Admission, the Company will have 287,995,114 ordinary shares outstanding. Shareholders may use this number as the denominator for the calculation by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change in their interest in, the issued share capital of the Company.\u201d",

In the context of early-stage startup financing, prepayment is a highly sensitive and often restricted term for the following reasons: 1. Investor Resistance Loss of Upside: Investors generally oppose prepayment clauses because they want the option to convert their debt into high-value equity. If a company prepays the loan just before a major funding round or exit, the investor loses the \"upside\" of converting at a discount or under a valuation cap. \"No Prepayment\" Clauses: Most standard startup term sheets explicitly state that the company cannot prepay the notes without the prior written consent of the noteholders. 2. Strategic Use for Founders Avoiding Dilution: Founders may seek the right to prepay if the company becomes unexpectedly profitable or has access to cheaper capital. By repaying the loan in cash, they avoid the \"unfavorable terms\" of conversion that would dilute their ownership. Clean-Up: Prepayment can be used to \"clean up\" a cap table by removing small debt holders before a new institutional investor comes on board. 3. Automatic Repayment Events Prepayment can sometimes be triggered automatically by specific \"Events of Default\" or corporate changes, rather than a voluntary choice by the company: Insolvency: Legal requirements may force repayment if the company enters bankruptcy. Change of Control: If the company is acquired, notes may be paid off immediately in cash rather than converted, depending on the agreed terms. Material Breach: Failure to follow the agreed-upon negative covenants can trigger immediate repayment. 4. Valuation Implications In financial modeling, the \"callability\" (the issuer's right to prepay) reduces the fair value of the note for the investor. If a note is \"called\" for prepayment, the holder usually has a final window to choose between accepting the cash prepayment or exercising their conversion right to shares.",

Small data centres use from 5k to 15kt ... So how many data centres are being built globally? Analysts project massive global expansion, with some expecting over 2,000 new data centers built by 2030. The the mid point of 10-15kt and that's around 25mt of copper required just for data centres over the next 4-5 years. Escondido the world's largest copper mine - by orders of magnitude - produces 1.4mt annually - it's like 2x bigger than the next top 10 mines (all about 0.5mt each) add up to around 6-7 mt per annum - production... Global copper production was around 23 million metric tons (MT) in 2024, with Chile leading by far (5.3 MT, 23%) Never mind the electricity gap... But what about the copper gap? Planned hyper scale and global data centres alone will use circa 10-20% of global copper supply. What about everything else? EV - is the biggest rising demand , extending replacing ageing power grid networks, general construction wiring, military demand, developing world - ie virgin demand - in Africa, India and booming South East Asia It's like trying to squeeze the contents of the Hoover dam through a garden hose.

          "content": "MT\u2026 so a topic of conversation on this and other BB\u2019s at the time that NIU bond deal went sour, was the question of whether PXC could use Bond capital to pay down the coupon.  In usual circumstances, where capital is raised as development capital (which in this case, it was) there will invariably be a clause in the contract prohibiting the use of the capital for P and L expenditure, which, by its definition, includes the servicing of the coupon.  The prohibition on coupon servicing will probably have been specific in the contract aswell.  Given where the NAV for Empire is, give NIU any opportunity to foreclose on it for the \u00a35m it is in for, and it will take it, no question.  Any breach of duty, contract or performance under the terms of the NIU deal will automatically be terminal for PXC. The LOI was specifically a non-binding LOI, so no legal standing.  Plus I highly doubt that Indigo has anything to do with the Investor.  The situation is that in 2024, PXC entered into its original arrangement with Riverfort to provide working capital for PXC in a deal that was very favourable to PXC, but contingent on PXC securing at least $25m from a bond raise, for PXC to benefit from those favourable terms.  With the NIU deal in 2024, it appeared to everyone that PXC had pulled it off and delivered on the Riverfort condition, only then for NIU to pull out.  It left PXC in 2025 having to draw down additional funds on the Riverfort deal, but the cash costs and fees were just too punitive to continue with Riverfort on that basis whilst they waited for the bond deal to arrive, which of course it hasn\u2019t. The Indigo deal at the end of 2025 was concluded because it was cheaper to service month to month, which matters when you\u2019re trying to survive to the next funding event, but it has come with a greater dilutive effect upon shareholders.  It was probably the right thing to do.  It\u2019s possible that the Directors that are now suspended may have \u201ctaken one for the team\u201d by doing what they have done, although at this stage it\u2019s difficult to say with any certainty whether that is the situation. The most sensible solution for the Company right now will be to get into a room with Indigo, to establish how it can structure something around a settlement with Riverfort, and that will ensure that the Company does not default on the payment of the Coupon to NIU.  That is going to come at a cost to shareholders.  Sub-1p incoming I envisage. GLA GLA.",

Took a 40% loss in September on the ones I bought after the LOI was signed in June, after it turned out the \"complete late this month early next\"  and signed subject to site visit was bs. Then took an 85% loss on my original investment from 2021 after that CLN was announced in December. Thankfully already made my money back and more on the 40% and on the way to with the 85% with the places I invested it, glad I sold when I did considering this continues to go down and wouldn't have made my money back with what's to come here if I held. Might dip back in if Ryan sorts it out and they have some cash flow but definitely not as it stands right now. What's your loss and do you honestly think you'll get it back here with what we know?

Couple that with the all the issues that have come to light in the past moth and even the bucket shops won't want to take it on. No chance Riverfort are handing back $1.5m . \"The terms of the CLN suggest PXC hope to have finance sorted by end of April 2026.\" - Hope being the important word - and who negotiated the CLN? Go figure. They've always said they hoped it'd be sorted soon as far back as 2021 and it never has. Their negotiating position gets weaker by the day. \"Hopefully PXC withheld some of the $5m NIU bond to pay the coupon \" - To pay the coupon maybe, but they defo didn't hold anything back for a prepayment penalty. \" An LOI has some legal context to it \" - It's a non-binding LOI, the legal context is it isn't worth the paper it's written on. Nothing is enforceable. \"if it is withdrawn PXC would have to RNS im sure\" - see earlier post on governance. I don't think there's even any legal requirement to officially \"withdraw\" it as such, they could just walk away without withdrawing it in a formal sense. \"IMO PXC isn't going into administration any time soon.

          "content": "MTSparky Three fundamentals here to unpack\u2026 First is the position of Indigo Capital.  Did the Company make misrepresentations to Indigo in securing funding in December 2025? If it did, Indigo could claim that it never would have made the funding in the first place had it known of the Company\u2019s actual state of affairs.  Solid grounds for rescission? Probably Indigo\u2019s strongest claim, which will also give them options in how they feature in where this goes from here. Second, is the position of Riverfort, and the early repayment of the Riverfort Debt.  The legality of that is challengable on all sorts of different levels.  On one of those, Riverfort has fought its way back into the picture, alongside Indigo, on a contractual point regarding prepayment.  Riverfort might have grounds to argue the opposite of Indigo, that it intended to exercise the CLN\u2019s and would have done had PXC given prior notice of its intention to prepay.   I\u2019m also not sure that the Company was in a position to repay Riverfort the whole sum due. Given the indebtedness of the Company,  given the Company\u2019s known solvency position at the time that it repaid the sum, there\u2019s a fair argument to say that a repayment in full to Riverfort was disproportionate and the repayment constituted a preference, when the Company was trading insolvently. Third, is the position of NIU.  NIU\u2019s \u00a35m debt is secured over the Empire assets.  Is PXC maintaining its coupon payments to NIU or is PXC in breach?  I can only assume (and hope) that the coupon payments are being properly maintained.  The moment that they are not, NIU will have the power to foreclose on the Empire assets, assuming that Konnex Resources Inc, is included in the schedule of \u2018Group\u2019 Companies on which NIU took security from PXC.  At this juncture, it appears that NIU is in the box seats IMO.  It has options at its disposal in the event of a default of PXC\u2019s payment of the coupon.  It also has a potential claim regarding repayment to Riverfort being a \u2018preference\u2019, if it chooses not to/can\u2019t foreclose. It\u2019s game over for Riverfort, Indigo (and of course PXC) if NIU foreclose on Empire, so it is in the interests of Riverfort and Indigo to get into dialogue with PXC in how it can ensure that PXC stays alive.  It could be the golden ticket that PXC can use to buy itself a lifeline from either/both Riverfort/Indigo to get out of the mess PXC finds itself in. Fourth, any new institutional money coming in to salvage PXC is highly unlikely; PXC is a red flag unless or until the decks are cleared governance-wise and that\u2019s not going to happen in the time that it will take before PXC\u2019s cash runs dry. Fifth is the undisclosed investor.  If he is savvy enough and well-advised as I think, he would be doing exactly what he\u2019s done: he\u2019s got close enough to the action to find out what\u2019s going on, and has held off long enough to allow all the excrement from the PXC barrel to float to the surface. Let\u2019s  see how th",

The point regarding running two CLN\u2019s at the same time, I\u2019m not sure I follow that argument.  Whilst it seems clear to me (brought about by the action of Riverfort potentially claiming prepayment fees from PXC for early redemption of Riverfort CLN\u2019s) that Riverfort was not consulted, or even aware of, the early redemption of the Riverfort CLN\u2019s, it does appear that PXC used the funds incoming from Indigo to prepay the Riverfort CLN\u2019s, in which case, there would not have been two separate CLN\u2019s (one from Riverfort and the other from Indigo) running in tandem at the same time. I do think, however, that the claim that NIU and/or Indigo might have against PXC for paying Riverfort as a preference in a situation where PXC was knowingly operating insolvently, has some legs.  Even if the case is weak, what it does do is block any additional sources of funding coming in to the business, and gives Indigo and NIU the whip hand at the negotiating table. GLA",

We don't even know the true number of shares that have been issued because they already had form for late reporting and now any claim originating from CFO is under deep scrutiny. I don't know how anyone could unpick this to arrive at a valuation above zero. I am amazed the Nomad has allowed this to continue to trade.

          "content": "Well said Forcella regarding these rampers, namely Latino and Magmanus_49.  Like vultures picking on the scraps.  Neither of them care about the complexities that PXC has to face ahead of it, just a quick buck in and out and they don\u2019t care if they pump and dump and leave you holding the baby when this goes further down. Unlike Forcella, I\u2019m really not convinced that Indigo will convert any more CLN\u2019s now knowing that there are Governance, solvency and management issues at PXC.  Is it worth the risk of damaging its reputation with its clients any more than it already has done on PXC, by converting potentially up to another $500,000 worth of CLN\u2019s at a VWAP of say 1p, for stock that could be worth $0 at some point in time in the near future, and most importantly, with no sign of development funding or cash runway beyond end Q2 on the table? Rightly so, there\u2019ll be a serious amount of concern and no doubt, scrutiny at Indigo Capital over the validity of the representations made by PXC when this funding was put in place in December 2025.

It\u2019s highly doubtful that converting more CLN\u2019s at this stage makes any sense to them.  Converting a quarter of the value of its CLN\u2019s on 23rd January 2026 at 1.48p, less than two weeks ago, and subsequently having sold those converted shares to Private Equity/family office clients at a margin on 1.48p has already blown up in their face, with PXC, within two weeks of those deals, announcing financial irregularities and a whole host of governance issues that will lead off the back of it.

          "content": "Magmanus_49\u2026 \u201cThe focus now shifts to execution: appointing a new CFO, securing short- and long-term financing, and stabilising operations. Importantly, these financing discussions were already referenced in the January 2025 update, when the share price was around 2\u20133p \u2014 a level that already appeared oversold at the time.\u201d Some of what the new CFO will be challenged with early on in this process include: Indigo Capital will undoubtedly be looking closely at what and when certain things occurred in the time leading up to Indigo confirming funding to PXC, and asking questions as to whether any misrepresentation to Indigo occurred.  Did PXC know, or reasonably ought to have known of the misconduct, or any other disclosable matter before December 2025; and if so, would Indigo have invested at all if it had known of the misconduct prior to lending? Payment to Riverfort deemed as a \u2018preference\u2019.  There has to be a question from Indigo Capital, and on the same basis, NIU, regarding the context and timing of the raising of the funds by PXC from Indigo, and the repayment/prepayment of Riverfort with those funds raised from Indigo.  At the time of the payment to Riverfort, was PXC knowingly trading in cash flow insolvency? If Indigo and/or NIU can argue that PXC was technically insolvent at the time that it repaid Riverfort, either or both of them would have good grounds to argue that PXC has given preference to Riverfort in its payment to it as a creditor. These factors are material issues to PXC as BOD\u2019s, and to any potential future funder/investors at this time.  Of course Indigo and NIU are going to be asking these questions of PXC at this time, looking for ways to secure their positions as best they can.  It would be naive of anyone investing in PXC not to consider this is the situation. The ramifications are that it: (a) slows any new funding down essentially to a halt, unless or until questions including misreps and preference questions have been satisfactorily answered to the positive; and (b) open the question that if Indigo were misrepresented by PXC, will Indigo rescind the current financing; and (c) opens the question that if Indigo and/or NIU can argue that PXC was technically insolvent at the time that it repaid/prepaid Riverfort whether that payment be recalled to PXC, as it was deemed to be paid in preference over other creditors?

The company can then have a clean slate to progress the larger financing. It\u2019s almost certain that previous finance discussions have fallen by the wayside because Wilkins and Edwards-Jones were perceived as untrustworthy sheisters. Ryan McDermott comes across as different, and anyone that\u2019s met him at AGM\u2019s would say the same. It\u2019s just not been his company to run all these years despite being CEO because everything went through Wilkins. He\u2019s now the proper frontman. They\u2019ll be no more wild statements or speculation in RNS\u2019s, which is why he likely didn\u2019t mention the US investor today. It happens when it happens, and then we\u2019ll be told. There\u2019s still a viable company here, and while we\u2019re likely to suffer dilution to clear the vultures out, I\u2019d expect a far more sensible finance package to be put in place and the bonds finally kicked to the curb.",

The point regarding running two CLN\u2019s at the same time, I\u2019m not sure I follow that argument.  Whilst it seems clear to me (brought about by the action of Riverfort potentially claiming prepayment fees from PXC for early redemption of Riverfort CLN\u2019s) that Riverfort was not consulted, or even aware of, the early redemption of the Riverfort CLN\u2019s, it does appear that PXC used the funds incoming from Indigo to prepay the Riverfort CLN\u2019s, in which case, there would not have been two separate CLN\u2019s (one from Riverfort and the other from Indigo) running in tandem at the same time. I do think, however, that the claim that NIU and/or Indigo might have against PXC for paying Riverfort as a preference in a situation where PXC was knowingly operating insolvently, has some legs.  Even if the case is weak, what it does do is block any additional sources of funding coming in to the business, and gives Indigo and NIU the whip hand at the negotiating table. GLA",

It would be bad enough if there was just one CLN but that there were two effectively running concurrently, with both creditors apparently unaware of the extent of the others lending. We don't even know the true number of shares that have been issued because they already had form for late reporting and now any claim originating from CFO is under deep scrutiny. I don't know how anyone could unpick this to arrive at a valuation above zero. I am amazed the Nomad has allowed this to continue to trade.

Unlike Forcella, I\u2019m really not convinced that Indigo will convert any more CLN\u2019s now knowing that there are Governance, solvency and management issues at PXC.  Is it worth the risk of damaging its reputation with its clients any more than it already has done on PXC, by converting potentially up to another $500,000 worth of CLN\u2019s at a VWAP of say 1p, for stock that could be worth $0 at some point in time in the near future, and most importantly, with no sign of development funding or cash runway beyond end Q2 on the table? Rightly so, there\u2019ll be a serious amount of concern and no doubt, scrutiny at Indigo Capital over the validity of the representations made by PXC when this funding was put in place in December 2025.

It\u2019s highly doubtful that converting more CLN\u2019s at this stage makes any sense to them.

          "content": "Magmanus_49\u2026 \u201cThe focus now shifts to execution: appointing a new CFO, securing short- and long-term financing, and stabilising operations. Importantly, these financing discussions were already referenced in the January 2025 update, when the share price was around 2\u20133p \u2014 a level that already appeared oversold at the time.\u201d Some of what the new CFO will be challenged with early on in this process include: Indigo Capital will undoubtedly be looking closely at what and when certain things occurred in the time leading up to Indigo confirming funding to PXC, and asking questions as to whether any misrepresentation to Indigo occurred.  Did PXC know, or reasonably ought to have known of the misconduct, or any other disclosable matter before December 2025; and if so, would Indigo have invested at all if it had known of the misconduct prior to lending? Payment to Riverfort deemed as a \u2018preference\u2019.  There has to be a question from Indigo Capital, and on the same basis, NIU, regarding the context and timing of the raising of the funds by PXC from Indigo, and the repayment/prepayment of Riverfort with those funds raised from Indigo.  At the time of the payment to Riverfort, was PXC knowingly trading in cash flow insolvency? If Indigo and/or NIU can argue that PXC was technically insolvent at the time that it repaid Riverfort, either or both of them would have good grounds to argue that PXC has given preference to Riverfort in its payment to it as a creditor. These factors are material issues to PXC as BOD\u2019s, and to any potential future funder/investors at this time.  Of course Indigo and NIU are going to be asking these questions of PXC at this time, looking for ways to secure their positions as best they can.  It would be naive of anyone investing in PXC not to consider this is the situation. The ramifications are that it: (a) slows any new funding down essentially to a halt, unless or until questions including misreps and preference questions have been satisfactorily answered to the positive; and (b) open the question that if Indigo were misrepresented by PXC, will Indigo rescind the current financing; and (c) opens the question that if Indigo and/or NIU can argue that PXC was technically insolvent at the time that it repaid/prepaid Riverfort whether that payment be recalled to PXC, as it was deemed to be paid in preference over other creditors?

There\u2019s going to be a short period of having to unpick the mess we\u2019ve been left in, and then shake the vultures off. No doubt this will come at a price, but it\u2019s survivable. The company can then have a clean slate to progress the larger financing. It\u2019s almost certain that previous finance discussions have fallen by the wayside because Wilkins and Edwards-Jones were perceived as untrustworthy sheisters. Ryan McDermott comes across as different, and anyone that\u2019s met him at AGM\u2019s would say the same. It\u2019s just not been his company to run all these years despite being CEO because everything went through Wilkins. He\u2019s now the proper frontman. They\u2019ll be no more wild statements or speculation in RNS\u2019s, which is why he likely didn\u2019t mention the US investor today. It happens when it happens, and then we\u2019ll be told. There\u2019s still a viable company here, and while we\u2019re likely to suffer dilution to clear the vultures out, I\u2019d expect a far more sensible finance package to be put in place and the bonds finally kicked to the curb.",

          "content": "Thanks \u2014 yes, I meant the CFO and Chairman. The removal of two senior executives should be viewed in context. Given the company\u2019s underlying assets, it\u2019s difficult to justify a market cap below \u00a33m, yet that\u2019s where the stock is currently trading. This disconnect highlights just how oversold the situation has become. The shares were already heavily de-rated from around 6p at the start of the year, so the additional ~50% drop following decisive board action feels excessive rather than fundamental. In reality, markets tend to reward strong governance and transparency, especially when issues are confronted rather than ignored. Existing shareholders \u2014 and new buyers \u2014 generally value that approach. It\u2019s also worth noting that there are AIM shell companies with no meaningful assets trading at valuations above \u00a33m. Against that backdrop, PXC\u2019s valuation looks increasingly disconnected from reality. The focus now shifts to execution: appointing a new CFO, securing short- and long-term financing, and stabilising operations. Importantly, these financing discussions were already referenced in the January 2025 update, when the share price was around 2\u20133p \u2014 a level that already appeared oversold at the time. With hindsight, it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the board changes announced recently had been in progress for some time, potentially explaining the prolonged weakness in the share price. With those issues now addressed, the stock finally has a chance to reset and re-rate from deeply depressed levels. In short, this looks less like a business impairment and more like capitulation pricing driven by uncertainty \u2014 uncertainty that is now being actively resolved.",

If you or I were on the board, adding a little more skin may give confidence and also draw in more or keep others from abandoning the ship. Perhaps directors would also be aware such an action will then ensure a very lucrative salary by dragging this out for a few more years, then if such. it would be money well spent. Also, seems odd that a British group have discovered what is deemed significant wealth in the USA that was oblivious to the Americans. This seems unlikely and open to questions as to why they never researched the potential themselves being hardly short of hi tech, local knowledge, money etc. Also, should the Brits have discovered what was under the Americans noses, then I wonder that if it is a good as they say it is, the Americans will throw as many obstacles in the way to ensue that they pressure the group to breaking point and keep all profits for themselves, by hampering loans, by imposing rules and laws to ensure that extraction is as costly and long winded as feasible to then get the company bought out for a song as they run out of money waiting. So I hope that all the above is just irrational fear, but after seeing the share price plunge from many multiples of it's current price, still wonder if my gut feeling was correct. Whilst PM's and Copper may have risen dramatically, unless having any to sell, not in tiny fragments buried withing millions of tons of rock and earth, then the costs are growing but the income is still non existent. Debt is expensive and more so the longer this is dragged out. My gold Sov is worth \u00a3800 ish, but should I choose to grind it into tiny fragments, placing each fragment in a lump of rock, and scatter those rocks over acres and bury it under tons more debris, I doubt you would give me a pound for the license to find it, despite 'certainty it is out there' especially if you had to jump through lengthy hoops to obtain permission and to gain the funds from others when more interested parties to extract the wealth can pull strings harder. I guess if the new skin is because the board feel certain or more confident funding is coming soon, then we will all be happy and singing from the same hymn sheet, juries out until then from me. Re posted as at the time, when I questioned the motive of the board buying more, I was just insulted so seems I was right, their skin in the game counts for nothing.  Likely the Americans will snap it up on the cheap after toying with the dim limey's, who in turn have used shareholders cash to ensure a good few years of lucrative salaries and perhaps more invisible earnings.",

I\u2019ve been calling for the CFO to go for a long time - probably around September 2024 when he hid NIU hadn\u2019t allowed them to draw down the bonds as per the schedule they\u2019d communicated halfway down the interims. Then did an interview post market saying there was no problem with bond investor and that he saw this as a billion pound company. Likewise the Chairman should\u2019ve fallen on his sword long ago, it\u2019s been clear he\u2019s not had the contacts/competence to sell these bonds to anyone other than NIU who mugged him here and at his other gig at CRTM. This was on the telegram group which i\u2019m no longer a member of but i\u2019m sure someone can vouch. So no i\u2019d have got rid ages ago, and it\u2019s not come as a surprise they\u2019re alleged of being bent however it\u2019s too little too late at 1p and \u00a32.7m market cap. To answer your question what\u2019s changed in the last month: - It became clear that it took them 6 weeks to notify Indigo had converted at 1.48p. - That the board potentially bought shares so Indigo had volume to convert and sell into. The SP then pumped to 3p on the back of director buys. - It became apparent that the clowns in charge paid off Riverfort with the Indigo CLN without checking the terms of it and now may have a prepayment penalty liability of $109k (which they don\u2019t have) - The two in charge of finance are being investigated for being corrupt. - Gold up 10% - Copper price flat - PXC down 65% That\u2019s what\u2019s changed. I\u2019ve answered your question so perhaps you can answer all the ones in my previous post? Cheers.",

          "content": "Hey BritishPec , I did my research and many thanks. Enjoy: Strategic Report: Phoenix Copper (PXC.L) Liquidity Assessment The investment case for Phoenix Copper is now in a state of terminal duress following the suspension of its Executive Chairman and CFO on February 9, 2026. With the share price collapsing to 0.95p, the market is pricing in a high probability of insolvency or a dilutive restructuring that will effectively wipe out current equity holders. Break-Up Value & Assets The theoretical \"Break-Up\" value is based on the Empire Mine (8,434 acres in Idaho). The 2024 Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS) estimated a pre-tax Net Present Value (NPV) of $252 million, implying an asset-backed value of roughly 24p per share. However, in a distressed liquidation, this paper value serves as a ceiling for creditors, not a floor for shareholders. Secured lenders, led by Riverfort Global Opportunities, would likely seize the physical assets (land and equipment already staged in Idaho). For common shareholders, the recovery value in a fire sale is estimated at near-zero. Likelihood of Funding & Investors The probability of securing the proposed $75 million corporate bond has fallen to 15%. The ongoing \"conduct investigation\" makes the company un-investable for new institutional capital. The most likely source of survival capital is a \"predatory\" bridge loan from Riverfort or a distress-focused investor like NIU Invest (~45% probability). These investors typically utilize \"death spiral\" financing, converting debt into equity at massive discounts, which would further crush the share price. Rating: SELL / DURESS The stock is a \"Value Trap.\" While the land is worth 24p, the 8-week cash runway and management vacuum suggest a total loss of capital is the most probable outcome.",

          "content": "Strategic Report: Phoenix Copper (PXC.L) Liquidity Assessment The investment case for Phoenix Copper is now in a state of terminal duress following the suspension of its Executive Chairman and CFO on February 9, 2026. With the share price collapsing to 0.95p, the market is pricing in a high probability of insolvency or a dilutive restructuring that will effectively wipe out current equity holders. Break-Up Value & Assets The theoretical \"Break-Up\" value is based on the Empire Mine (8,434 acres in Idaho). The 2024 Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS) estimated a pre-tax Net Present Value (NPV) of $252 million, implying an asset-backed value of roughly 24p per share. However, in a distressed liquidation, this paper value serves as a ceiling for creditors, not a floor for shareholders. Secured lenders, led by Riverfort Global Opportunities, would likely seize the physical assets (land and equipment already staged in Idaho). For common shareholders, the recovery value in a fire sale is estimated at near-zero. Likelihood of Funding & Investors The probability of securing the proposed $75 million corporate bond has fallen to 15%. The ongoing \"conduct investigation\" makes the company un-investable for new institutional capital. The most likely source of survival capital is a \"predatory\" bridge loan from Riverfort or a distress-focused investor like NIU Invest (~45% probability). These investors typically utilize \"death spiral\" financing, converting debt into equity at massive discounts, which would further crush the share price. Rating: SELL / DURESS The stock is a \"Value Trap.\" While the land is worth 24p, the 8-week cash runway and management vacuum suggest a total loss of capital is the most probable outcome.",

          "content": "Thanks \u2014 yes, I meant the CFO and Chairman. The removal of two senior executives should be viewed in context. Given the company\u2019s underlying assets, it\u2019s difficult to justify a market cap below \u00a33m, yet that\u2019s where the stock is currently trading. This disconnect highlights just how oversold the situation has become. The shares were already heavily de-rated from around 6p at the start of the year, so the additional ~50% drop following decisive board action feels excessive rather than fundamental. In reality, markets tend to reward strong governance and transparency, especially when issues are confronted rather than ignored. Existing shareholders \u2014 and new buyers \u2014 generally value that approach. It\u2019s also worth noting that there are AIM shell companies with no meaningful assets trading at valuations above \u00a33m. Against that backdrop, PXC\u2019s valuation looks increasingly disconnected from reality. The focus now shifts to execution: appointing a new CFO, securing short- and long-term financing, and stabilising operations. Importantly, these financing discussions were already referenced in the January 2025 update, when the share price was around 2\u20133p \u2014 a level that already appeared oversold at the time. With hindsight, it\u2019s reasonable to assume that the board changes announced recently had been in progress for some time, potentially explaining the prolonged weakness in the share price. With those issues now addressed, the stock finally has a chance to reset and re-rate from deeply depressed levels. In short, this looks less like a business impairment and more like capitulation pricing driven by uncertainty \u2014 uncertainty that is now being actively resolved.",

If you or I were on the board, adding a little more skin may give confidence and also draw in more or keep others from abandoning the ship. Perhaps directors would also be aware such an action will then ensure a very lucrative salary by dragging this out for a few more years, then if such. it would be money well spent. Also, seems odd that a British group have discovered what is deemed significant wealth in the USA that was oblivious to the Americans. This seems unlikely and open to questions as to why they never researched the potential themselves being hardly short of hi tech, local knowledge, money etc. Also, should the Brits have discovered what was under the Americans noses, then I wonder that if it is a good as they say it is, the Americans will throw as many obstacles in the way to ensue that they pressure the group to breaking point and keep all profits for themselves, by hampering loans, by imposing rules and laws to ensure that extraction is as costly and long winded as feasible to then get the company bought out for a song as they run out of money waiting. So I hope that all the above is just irrational fear, but after seeing the share price plunge from many multiples of it's current price, still wonder if my gut feeling was correct. Whilst PM's and Copper may have risen dramatically, unless having any to sell, not in tiny fragments buried withing millions of tons of rock and earth, then the costs are growing but the income is still non existent. Debt is expensive and more so the longer this is dragged out. My gold Sov is worth \u00a3800 ish, but should I choose to grind it into tiny fragments, placing each fragment in a lump of rock, and scatter those rocks over acres and bury it under tons more debris, I doubt you would give me a pound for the license to find it, despite 'certainty it is out there' especially if you had to jump through lengthy hoops to obtain permission and to gain the funds from others when more interested parties to extract the wealth can pull strings harder. I guess if the new skin is because the board feel certain or more confident funding is coming soon, then we will all be happy and singing from the same hymn sheet, juries out until then from me. Re posted as at the time, when I questioned the motive of the board buying more, I was just insulted so seems I was right, their skin in the game counts for nothing.  Likely the Americans will snap it up on the cheap after toying with the dim limey's, who in turn have used shareholders cash to ensure a good few years of lucrative salaries and perhaps more invisible earnings.",

I\u2019ve been calling for the CFO to go for a long time - probably around September 2024 when he hid NIU hadn\u2019t allowed them to draw down the bonds as per the schedule they\u2019d communicated halfway down the interims. Then did an interview post market saying there was no problem with bond investor and that he saw this as a billion pound company. Likewise the Chairman should\u2019ve fallen on his sword long ago, it\u2019s been clear he\u2019s not had the contacts/competence to sell these bonds to anyone other than NIU who mugged him here and at his other gig at CRTM. This was on the telegram group which i\u2019m no longer a member of but i\u2019m sure someone can vouch. So no i\u2019d have got rid ages ago, and it\u2019s not come as a surprise they\u2019re alleged of being bent however it\u2019s too little too late at 1p and \u00a32.7m market cap. To answer your question what\u2019s changed in the last month: - It became clear that it took them 6 weeks to notify Indigo had converted at 1.48p. - That the board potentially bought shares so Indigo had volume to convert and sell into. The SP then pumped to 3p on the back of director buys. - It became apparent that the clowns in charge paid off Riverfort with the Indigo CLN without checking the terms of it and now may have a prepayment penalty liability of $109k (which they don\u2019t have) - The two in charge of finance are being investigated for being corrupt. - Gold up 10% - Copper price flat - PXC down 65% That\u2019s what\u2019s changed. I\u2019ve answered your question so perhaps you can answer all the ones in my previous post? Cheers.",

          "content": "Hey BritishPec , I did my research and many thanks. Enjoy: Strategic Report: Phoenix Copper (PXC.L) Liquidity Assessment The investment case for Phoenix Copper is now in a state of terminal duress following the suspension of its Executive Chairman and CFO on February 9, 2026. With the share price collapsing to 0.95p, the market is pricing in a high probability of insolvency or a dilutive restructuring that will effectively wipe out current equity holders. Break-Up Value & Assets The theoretical \"Break-Up\" value is based on the Empire Mine (8,434 acres in Idaho). The 2024 Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS) estimated a pre-tax Net Present Value (NPV) of $252 million, implying an asset-backed value of roughly 24p per share. However, in a distressed liquidation, this paper value serves as a ceiling for creditors, not a floor for shareholders. Secured lenders, led by Riverfort Global Opportunities, would likely seize the physical assets (land and equipment already staged in Idaho). For common shareholders, the recovery value in a fire sale is estimated at near-zero. Likelihood of Funding & Investors The probability of securing the proposed $75 million corporate bond has fallen to 15%. The ongoing \"conduct investigation\" makes the company un-investable for new institutional capital. The most likely source of survival capital is a \"predatory\" bridge loan from Riverfort or a distress-focused investor like NIU Invest (~45% probability). These investors typically utilize \"death spiral\" financing, converting debt into equity at massive discounts, which would further crush the share price. Rating: SELL / DURESS The stock is a \"Value Trap.\" While the land is worth 24p, the 8-week cash runway and management vacuum suggest a total loss of capital is the most probable outcome.",

Go on, i'll humour you: How do they finance this without diluting shareholders into oblivion at this price level: - Indigo have $483k worth of shares to convert at a 20% discount to vwap - Pay $109k to Riverfort as a prepayment penalty - Pay the NIU coupon - Pay an interim CFO - Fund investigation into the 2 suspended directors and any subsequent legal action - Secure cash run away beyond early Q2 to be signed off as a going concern. That's to keep the lights on... NIU have security over the Empire mine... they can't sell it to pay them their $5m back, it goes to NIU if they default. How do they pay any fees associated with selling the $75m worth of bonds needed -  advisers, finders fees etc.? Confetti, and lots of it. That's if it doesn't go into admin which is the most likely scenario imo.",

          "content": "Strategic Report: Phoenix Copper (PXC.L) Liquidity Assessment The investment case for Phoenix Copper is now in a state of terminal duress following the suspension of its Executive Chairman and CFO on February 9, 2026. With the share price collapsing to 0.95p, the market is pricing in a high probability of insolvency or a dilutive restructuring that will effectively wipe out current equity holders. Break-Up Value & Assets The theoretical \"Break-Up\" value is based on the Empire Mine (8,434 acres in Idaho). The 2024 Pre-Feasibility Study (PFS) estimated a pre-tax Net Present Value (NPV) of $252 million, implying an asset-backed value of roughly 24p per share. However, in a distressed liquidation, this paper value serves as a ceiling for creditors, not a floor for shareholders. Secured lenders, led by Riverfort Global Opportunities, would likely seize the physical assets (land and equipment already staged in Idaho). For common shareholders, the recovery value in a fire sale is estimated at near-zero. Likelihood of Funding & Investors The probability of securing the proposed $75 million corporate bond has fallen to 15%. The ongoing \"conduct investigation\" makes the company un-investable for new institutional capital. The most likely source of survival capital is a \"predatory\" bridge loan from Riverfort or a distress-focused investor like NIU Invest (~45% probability). These investors typically utilize \"death spiral\" financing, converting debt into equity at massive discounts, which would further crush the share price. Rating: SELL / DURESS The stock is a \"Value Trap.\" While the land is worth 24p, the 8-week cash runway and management vacuum suggest a total loss of capital is the most probable outcome.",

Application has been made for the New Ordinary Shares to be admitted to trading on AIM (\"Admission\"). It is expected that Admission will become effective and dealings will commence at 8:00 am on or around 26 January 2026. The Company has been informed that Indigo has entered into agreements to divest 24,181,814 of the New Ordinary Shares to various equity funds and family offices in Europe and elsewhere, as soon as practicable following Admission. Following Admission, the Company will have 287,995,114 ordinary shares outstanding. Shareholders may use this number as the denominator for the calculation by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change in their interest in, the issued share capital of the Company.\u201d",

In the context of early-stage startup financing, prepayment is a highly sensitive and often restricted term for the following reasons: 1. Investor Resistance Loss of Upside: Investors generally oppose prepayment clauses because they want the option to convert their debt into high-value equity. If a company prepays the loan just before a major funding round or exit, the investor loses the \"upside\" of converting at a discount or under a valuation cap. \"No Prepayment\" Clauses: Most standard startup term sheets explicitly state that the company cannot prepay the notes without the prior written consent of the noteholders. 2. Strategic Use for Founders Avoiding Dilution: Founders may seek the right to prepay if the company becomes unexpectedly profitable or has access to cheaper capital. By repaying the loan in cash, they avoid the \"unfavorable terms\" of conversion that would dilute their ownership. Clean-Up: Prepayment can be used to \"clean up\" a cap table by removing small debt holders before a new institutional investor comes on board. 3. Automatic Repayment Events Prepayment can sometimes be triggered automatically by specific \"Events of Default\" or corporate changes, rather than a voluntary choice by the company: Insolvency: Legal requirements may force repayment if the company enters bankruptcy. Change of Control: If the company is acquired, notes may be paid off immediately in cash rather than converted, depending on the agreed terms. Material Breach: Failure to follow the agreed-upon negative covenants can trigger immediate repayment. 4. Valuation Implications In financial modeling, the \"callability\" (the issuer's right to prepay) reduces the fair value of the note for the investor. If a note is \"called\" for prepayment, the holder usually has a final window to choose between accepting the cash prepayment or exercising their conversion right to shares.",

Small data centres use from 5k to 15kt ... So how many data centres are being built globally? Analysts project massive global expansion, with some expecting over 2,000 new data centers built by 2030. The the mid point of 10-15kt and that's around 25mt of copper required just for data centres over the next 4-5 years. Escondido the world's largest copper mine - by orders of magnitude - produces 1.4mt annually - it's like 2x bigger than the next top 10 mines (all about 0.5mt each) add up to around 6-7 mt per annum - production... Global copper production was around 23 million metric tons (MT) in 2024, with Chile leading by far (5.3 MT, 23%) Never mind the electricity gap... But what about the copper gap? Planned hyper scale and global data centres alone will use circa 10-20% of global copper supply. What about everything else? EV - is the biggest rising demand , extending replacing ageing power grid networks, general construction wiring, military demand, developing world - ie virgin demand - in Africa, India and booming South East Asia It's like trying to squeeze the contents of the Hoover dam through a garden hose. We need to find and build another 5-8 Escondidas in the next 6 years. OR / AND price has to rise a lot.\u201c Trek",

      "what_they_do": "Phoenix Copper Limited is an Australian exploration and development company that focuses on copper deposits.  It aims to bring a copper mine to production and sell copper concentrate to the global market.",
      "why_they_matter": "Copper is a cornerstone of the electric\u2011vehicle and renewable\u2011energy boom.  Phoenix\u2019s project sits on a high\u2011grade deposit in a resource\u2011rich region, giving it a chance to tap into the growing demand for clean\u2011energy metals.",
      "current_state": "The firm is in a severe cash\u2011burn phase.  Directors have been suspended, the company has no recent funding, and its share price sits at just over one penny, a fraction of the price it once traded at.  The stock now trades as a distressed shell with no clear path to profitability."
    },
    "whats_happening_now": {
      "rns_narrative": [
        "The company is still trying to secure working capital, but no new funding has materialised.  Management changes and regulatory scrutiny have added to uncertainty.",
        "There are no recent project milestones or positive updates \u2013 the focus remains on survival rather than growth.",
        "Overall, the narrative is one of survival and potential restructuring, with no clear sign of a turnaround yet."
      ],
      "crowd_tape": {
        "dominant_theme": "Quiet desperation \u2013 investors are silent but wary, with a few hopeful voices about a possible rescue.",
        "bull_narrative": "No bullish chatter has surfaced; the market sees Phoenix as a distressed asset with no immediate upside.",
        "bear_narrative": "Bears point to the suspended directors, the lack of funding, and the risk of delisting.  They see the company as a potential dead\u2011weight.",
        "sentiment_shift": "The mood remains flat; no new optimism has emerged, and the community continues to stay quiet."
      },
      "attention_check": "Google Trends are flat \u2013 there is no public buzz, which is a good sign for a contrarian play."
    },
    "expect_next": {
      "near_term_catalysts": [
        "A successful bridge\u2011loan or equity raise before the end of Q2 would inject cash and restore confidence.",
        "If copper spot prices rise above $10 per pound, the economics of Phoenix\u2019s project improve dramatically and could spark a rally.",
        "A positive feasibility study or a new board appointment could signal a turnaround and lift the stock."
      ],
      "watch_for": "Look for a funding announcement, a new shareholder or board change, or a sudden spike in trading volume around 1.1\u20131.3p.  Also keep an eye on copper price movements; a rally could be a catalyst.",
      "timing_regime": "The shares are deep in a crash.  The APEX score indicates tight compression, so the mean\u2011reversion window is likely short.  A catalyst is needed to move the price out of the capitulation zone."
    },
    "buy_vs_sell": {
      "lean": "Contrarian Bullish",
      "bull_case": "If the price recovers to about 2.4p \u2013 roughly double the current level \u2013 that\u2019s a 100\u202f% upside.  A 150\u202f% gain is possible if it climbs to 3.5p.  Because the stock is already 70\u2011plus percent down, a bounce is asymmetric: the potential reward far exceeds the limited downside if a stop is set at 0.5p.",
      "bear_case": "If Phoenix fails to raise capital, the company could be delisted or collapse, driving the price to zero.  The worst\u2011case loss is 100\u202f% of the investment.",
      "risk_reward": "Potential upside 100\u2011150\u202f% versus a 50\u2011100\u202f% downside if you protect with a stop at 0.5p.  The risk\u2011reward ratio is roughly 1:2, favouring a contrarian stance."
    },
    "playbook": {
      "if_bullish": "Enter when the price bounces above 1.25p with volume 200\u202f% of the 20\u2011day average.  Size the position at 10\u202f% of your portfolio and place a stop at 0.5p to cap losses.  Consider a trailing stop once the price passes 2.0p.",
      "if_watching": "Wait for a funding announcement, a new board appointment, or a copper price lift above $10/lb.  A clear catalyst is required before committing capital.",
      "if_passing": "None \u2013 there are no imminent bankruptcy filings or delisting notices, so the setup remains viable."
    },
    "bottom_line": "Phoenix Copper is a deep\u2011crashed, cash\u2011starved miner with no current sentiment but clear potential catalysts; if a funding round or copper price surge materialises, the upside could double the price with a limited downside if a stop is set.",
