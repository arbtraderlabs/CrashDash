The objective of the DD campaign was to enhance the confidence in Mila's deposit model for Yarrol and to test for continuation of mineralised structures at depth.\nHighlights:\n\u00b7\nThe results from the first of six holes validates the exploration model and reinforces our belief that gold mineralisation at Yarrol has both scale and grade.\n\u00b7\nSignificant gold intercepts returned from the first diamond drill hole MYADD0205, including:\no\n5 m @ 2.78 g/t from 183 m\n\u25aa\nincluding\n1 m @ 6.89 g/t\nAu\n\u25aa\nand including\n1m @ 6.39 g/t Au\no\n2.19 m @ 1.1 g/t from 170.44 m\no\nAllowing for greater dilution of lower grade material between intercepts returns an interval of\n14 m @ 1.14 g/t from 178 m\n\u00b7\nHole MYADD0205 has now enabled the team to trace the mineralisation envelope through multiple drill intercepts from surface to approximately 200m depth, indicating a large, well-developed mineralised system that continues to be open at depth.\n\u00b7\nThe hole lies in an area of mineralisation outside the historic resource where Mila's initial RC drilling in Q1 2025 returned excellent intersections in several holes including 15m @ 1.76g/t Au from 101m in hole MYARC0204.\n\u00b7\nDetailed review of the core in relation to the high-grade assay results (>5 g/t) have enabled the team to begin evaluating the controlling features and will assist the understanding of grade distribution, which will ultimately lead into resource estimation work.\nTechnical Overview\nThe mineralisation intersected in this hole MYADD0205 is hosted in an easterly dipping sheeted vein system and within altered diorites, matching observations from RC drilling and confirming the continuation of mineralised structures to depth. This achieves a key aim of diamond drilling with the first set of results.\nThe data from the diamond drilling alongside assays from the lab are already validating and enhancing Mila\n'\ns deposit model for Yarrol, giving confidence that a large mineralised system is present with potential to deliver a significant resource. The new data will be applied immediately to the upcoming and fully funded RC drilling programme in early 2026.\nThe Company now awaits additional assays pending from the next five diamond holes drilled during the DD campaign in October 2025.\nMark Stephenson, Executive Chairman, commented:\n\"\nWe wanted evidence to show that the system could continue to grow at depth, and results from this first hole could not have asked for a more encouraging start to this drilling programme. Gold mineralisation is evident precisely where the team predicted and is being traced from surface, cross existing holes and down to over 200 metres, clearly demonstrating vertical continuity in the system.\nEqually important are core observations of sheeted veins and altered diorite correlating to the broad mineralised halo we are seeing. This points to a large-scale hydrothermal footprint capable of supporting both high-grade shoots and bulk tonnage potential. This first set of results, already give us the confidence to start on the pathway to commercial study work.\nThe team's field observations and structural predictions have correlated exceptionally well with the assay data. Confidence is high, and we are rapidly improving our understanding of grade distribution at Yarrol. Geostatistical analysis is still needed to understand variation in grade, but the presence of gold and knowledge attained from the drilling, will be invaluable as we push forward with the next phase of drilling and resource definition work.\"\nTable\n1\n.

Centurion is being kept aware of Mila's activities so as to initiate the campaign shortly after the campaign design has been finalised.\nMonal & Mt Steadman Drilling target work\n\u00b7\nFirst-phase exploration at Monal and Mt Steadman is scheduled for early Q1 2026, expanding the pipeline of drill ready targets across the broader Queensland portfolio.\no\nAt Monal, an Induced Polarisation (\"IP\") geophysical survey will be conducted around historic gold workings of the Monal Target, where gold mineralisation has been defined along a ~2km trend.\no\nAt Mt Steadman, targeted geophysical surveys will look to define and structure infill and step-out targets out from the known historic and non-compliant resource at the Fitzroy prospect where mineralisation from surface down to ~100m has intercepted grades of 23m @ 1.04g/t and 19m @ 1.21g/t gold.\no\nMapping and sampling will also take place to better define targets along the ~8km Perry Fault at Mt Steadman and target the London and Venus prospects where high grade intercepts included 2m @ 110g/t gold.\n\u00b7\nThese combined activities are designed to bring these targets up to a drill ready stage and expand the resource to be defined across the entire Queensland portfolio, leveraging the strong technical success already demonstrated at Yarrol.\nMark Stephenson, Executive Chairman, commented:\n\"The completion of our diamond drilling programme at Yarrol in early Q4 marked an important milestone for Mila as we accelerate towards the development of an MRE. Initial visual inspections of the core reinforced our confidence in our preliminary geological interpretations and as a result, we made the decision to increase the amount of samples to assay so that we can fully understand the newly defined mineralisation observed in the core.\n\"We now eagerly await the assay results, the first of which we expect imminently, so that we can further refine the project's geological model and finalise drill targets for the RC drilling programme which is now scheduled to commence following the seasonal holiday period. Drilling is the most capital-intensive part of our business, and we are taking the prudent decision schedule the RC programme once the team as adequate time to analyse the DD assays, to ensure a methodical approach to maximise drilling success. Our next objective is to target the higher-grade zones with greater precision, and in turn support the definition of an MRE.\n\"Alongside this, given the success we have had at Yarrol, we are now looking to develop our resource potential across the licence package by developing drill targets at the adjacent properties of Mt Steadman and Monal properties. With existing drilling and historic mining having occurred, the team see a clear pathway to bringing targets on these properties up to a similar stage of technical readiness as Yarrol. We look forward to sharing further updates on these planned work programmes and the Yarrol assay results in due course.\"\n**ENDS**\nFor more information visit www.milaresources.com or contact:\nMark Stephenson\nMila Resources Plc\ninfo@milaresources.com\nJonathan Evans\nTavira Securities Limited\n+44 (0) 20 7100 5100\nNick Emerson\nSI Capital\n+44 (0) 20 3143 0600\nSusie Geliher / Will Turner\nSt Brides Partners Limited\n+44 (0) 20 7236 1177\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
