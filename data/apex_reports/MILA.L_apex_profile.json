The programme successfully demonstrated the continuity of gold-bearing structures, with intercepts of ~5g/t gold traced from surface to ~230 metres depth and provided critical insight into the structural architecture of the system. These results, which did not deliver the grades anticipated at depth, has allowed the technical team to further refine the Company's geological model for Yarrol.\nWhile depth extensions along the Yarrol Fault corridor warrant further work over the medium term, the most compelling and capital efficient near-term opportunity lies in testing shallow targets along strike across the Yarrol, Monal and Mt Steadman licences. The Company remains fully funded and on track to commence RC drilling at Yarrol in Q1 2026.\nOverview\n\u00b7\nDiamond drilling, chosen to define structure, has confirmed continuity of gold-bearing features from surface to ~300m depth, though high-grade intercepts were less consistent at depth than in shallow zones.\n\u00b7\nThe programme successfully intercepted gold structures throughout the tested depth range and confirmed grades of up to 5 g/t gold at depth, validating the mineralised system's scale, however, mineralisation between 230m and 300m was lower grade and/or sporadic in holes MYDD207, MYDD208, MYD209 and MYDD210.\n\u00b7\nHole MYDD205 confirmed northern extension to gold mineralisation beyond the historic resource area, building upon the earlier RC drilling.\n\u00b7\nThe Gold-bearing structures have been confirmed to be continuous and repetitive along strike, increasing confidence in the scale of the system.\n\u00b7\nMila will now pursue additional near surface targets alongside historical resources with the objective of generating multiple shallow (to a depth of 150m) prospects featuring broad gold zones that can be efficiently tested and advanced towards potential production.\nMark Stephenson, Managing Director of Mila Resources, commented:\n\"The recent diamond drilling programme has given us highly valuable information regarding the continuity of our gold system at depth which will help us understand structures controlling gold mineralisation, and provide the data needed to make informed decisions about our next exploration programme. The grades were lower than anticipated albeit they confirmed that gold structures extend well below surface, with grades of 5 g/t still present at depth; an important validation of the system's scale.\n\"Following the DD programme, the most compelling near-term opportunity for the Company is to drill shallow targets along strike across the Yarrol, Monal and Mt Steadman licences. These include multiple high-quality untested targets alongside historical resources that can be tested in a low-risk and capital-efficient manner.\n\"We've only just started to explore this licence package, and we are not reliant on a single target or orebody but a portfolio of targets at Yarrol. We continue to systematically test a highly prospective district with proven gold endowment, and we are focussed on building a mineral resource of scale to move to development. The geological insights from this programme will strengthen our targeting as we move forward to the RC drilling programme that is scheduled to begin next month and more generally our resource expansion programme this year.\"\nFurther Information\nThe Company's maiden DD programme was designed to target potential extensions at depth of known mineralisation at Yarrol Central and Ridge, covering approximately 2km of the 20km Yarrol Fault corridor.\nThe diamond drilling programme successfully intercepted gold structures throughout the tested depth range and confirmed grades of up to 6.8 g/t gold at depth, demonstrating that the gold system remains active below the shallow oxide zone.\nThe high-grade intercepts became less frequent at depth compared to the Company's earlier shallow reverse circulation (RC) drilling results. To investigate whether this reflected true geological variation or a sampling issue, the Company deployed advanced photon assay technology on selected samples. While photon assays showed modest grade improvements in some intervals, results confirmed that gold distribution does change with depth, most likely reflecting natural geological zonation, structural complexity, or the transition from bulk RC sampling to narrow diamond core in a nuggety gold system.\nDrill Hole\nIntercept\nMYADD205\n1m @ 6.8 g/t Au from 183 m\n1m @ 6.3 g/t Au from 187m\n1.2m @ 1.1 g/t Au from 229.8m\nMYADD206\n1m @ 6 g/t Au from 143 m\n1m @ 1.2 g/t Au from 160 m\nMYADD207\n0.8m 1.33 g/t Au from 264.2\nMYADD208\nAwaiting return of all samples from drill hole.\nMYADD209\n1m @ 5.05 g/t Au from 195m, partial results still\nMYADD210\nAwaiting return of all samples from drill hole.\nMap of Q4 2025 Diamond Drilling completed at targets Ridge and Yarrol Central, part of the Yarrol property.\nThe broader intercepts from hole 205 are located in the northern extension zone beyond the historical resource boundary, confirming approximately 200m of strike continuity with high-grade intercepts of up to 16 g/t and 13 g/t gold previously recorded in shallow RC drilling (MYARC204). The upcoming RC campaign will target the Starlight and Ext-S zones to test for additional shallow ounces beyond the existing resource footprint.\nStrategic Implications\nThe DD programme has delivered important geological information, and the Company now intends to pursue targets at Yarrol that are near surface (to a depth of 150 metres), where broader zones of gold can be efficiently tested and potentially developed. This conclusion is supported by:\n\u00b7\nConfirmation that gold-bearing structures are continuous and repetitive along strike, increasing confidence in the scale of the system\n\u00b7\nMultiple untested high-grade targets along the 20km Yarrol Fault and at the Monal and Mt Steadman licences, several with historical resources and surrounded by satellite targets\n\u00b7\nThe opportunity to prioritise drill programmes that can deliver less risk and more capital efficient returns\nThe Company is now integrating the detailed structural and geochemical data from this programme with its extensive shallow RC drilling, geophysical surveys, and historical data to refine its geological model. This work will inform any future deeper drilling campaigns and ensure they are appropriately targeted.\nNext Steps\nMila is now focusing its capital and technical resources on the following priorities:\n\u00b7\nQ1 RC drilling programme:\nFully funded programme ready to commence, targeting resource growth along the Yarrol Fault. Future targets at Monal and Mt Steadman are also being considered, where historical intercepts and non-compliant resources offer strong exploration upside\n\u00b7\nGeological modelling:\nIntegrating the diamond drill dataset with RC drilling and geophysical data to better understand structural controls and gold distribution, including potential plunging high-grade shoots\n\u00b7\nProject ranking:\nApplying a disciplined capital allocation framework to prioritise targets offering the highest risk-adjusted returns across the Company's portfolio\nTechnical Background\nDiamond drilling was selected to obtain oriented core samples, enabling the team to assess structural controls on mineralisation, including vein orientation, faulting, and lithological boundaries, critical factors in understanding gold distribution that cannot be determined from RC drilling alone.\nThe programme tested extensions of mineralisation outside the historical resource areas. While diamond core provides unparalleled geological insight, the narrower sample volume can introduce greater variability in grade for a structurally complex, nuggety gold system compared to the larger sample volumes collected during RC drilling.\nThree geological interpretations are being evaluated:\n1.\nNatural zonation:\nHigher grades may be concentrated in the upper portions of the hydrothermal system, with lower grades at depth reflecting vertical geochemical gradients\n2.\nStructural complexity:\nHigh-grade gold shoots may plunge or repeat along strike rather than continuing uniformly down-dip, supporting the potential for multiple discrete high-value targets across the system\n3.\nSampling methodology:\nThe transition from high-density, large-volume RC sampling in shallow areas to lower-density, narrow diamond core at depth may be affecting the representativeness of assays in a nuggety mineralised environment\nThe data generated from this programme significantly enhances the Company's geological understanding and will directly inform future targeting, capital allocation and drill design.\n**ENDS**\nFor more information visit www.milaresources.com or contact:\nMark Stephenson\nMila Resources Plc\ninfo@milaresources.com\nJonathan Evans\nTavira Financial Limited\n+44 (0) 20 7100 5100\nNick Emerson\nSI Capital\n+44 (0) 20 3143 0600\nDamon Heath\nShard Capital Partners LLP\n+44 (0) 20 3971 7000\nSusie Geliher / Will Turner\nSt Brides Partners Limited\n+44 (0) 20 7236 1177\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The objective of the DD campaign was to enhance the confidence in Mila's deposit model for Yarrol and to test for continuation of mineralised structures at depth.\nHighlights:\n\u00b7\nThe results from the first of six holes validates the exploration model and reinforces our belief that gold mineralisation at Yarrol has both scale and grade.\n\u00b7\nSignificant gold intercepts returned from the first diamond drill hole MYADD0205, including:\no\n5 m @ 2.78 g/t from 183 m\n\u25aa\nincluding\n1 m @ 6.89 g/t\nAu\n\u25aa\nand including\n1m @ 6.39 g/t Au\no\n2.19 m @ 1.1 g/t from 170.44 m\no\nAllowing for greater dilution of lower grade material between intercepts returns an interval of\n14 m @ 1.14 g/t from 178 m\n\u00b7\nHole MYADD0205 has now enabled the team to trace the mineralisation envelope through multiple drill intercepts from surface to approximately 200m depth, indicating a large, well-developed mineralised system that continues to be open at depth.\n\u00b7\nThe hole lies in an area of mineralisation outside the historic resource where Mila's initial RC drilling in Q1 2025 returned excellent intersections in several holes including 15m @ 1.76g/t Au from 101m in hole MYARC0204.\n\u00b7\nDetailed review of the core in relation to the high-grade assay results (>5 g/t) have enabled the team to begin evaluating the controlling features and will assist the understanding of grade distribution, which will ultimately lead into resource estimation work.\nTechnical Overview\nThe mineralisation intersected in this hole MYADD0205 is hosted in an easterly dipping sheeted vein system and within altered diorites, matching observations from RC drilling and confirming the continuation of mineralised structures to depth. This achieves a key aim of diamond drilling with the first set of results.\nThe data from the diamond drilling alongside assays from the lab are already validating and enhancing Mila\n'\ns deposit model for Yarrol, giving confidence that a large mineralised system is present with potential to deliver a significant resource. The new data will be applied immediately to the upcoming and fully funded RC drilling programme in early 2026.\nThe Company now awaits additional assays pending from the next five diamond holes drilled during the DD campaign in October 2025.\nMark Stephenson, Executive Chairman, commented:\n\"\nWe wanted evidence to show that the system could continue to grow at depth, and results from this first hole could not have asked for a more encouraging start to this drilling programme. Gold mineralisation is evident precisely where the team predicted and is being traced from surface, cross existing holes and down to over 200 metres, clearly demonstrating vertical continuity in the system.\nEqually important are core observations of sheeted veins and altered diorite correlating to the broad mineralised halo we are seeing. This points to a large-scale hydrothermal footprint capable of supporting both high-grade shoots and bulk tonnage potential. This first set of results, already give us the confidence to start on the pathway to commercial study work.\nThe team's field observations and structural predictions have correlated exceptionally well with the assay data. Confidence is high, and we are rapidly improving our understanding of grade distribution at Yarrol. Geostatistical analysis is still needed to understand variation in grade, but the presence of gold and knowledge attained from the drilling, will be invaluable as we push forward with the next phase of drilling and resource definition work.\"\nTable\n1\n.

Centurion is being kept aware of Mila's activities so as to initiate the campaign shortly after the campaign design has been finalised.\nMonal & Mt Steadman Drilling target work\n\u00b7\nFirst-phase exploration at Monal and Mt Steadman is scheduled for early Q1 2026, expanding the pipeline of drill ready targets across the broader Queensland portfolio.\no\nAt Monal, an Induced Polarisation (\"IP\") geophysical survey will be conducted around historic gold workings of the Monal Target, where gold mineralisation has been defined along a ~2km trend.\no\nAt Mt Steadman, targeted geophysical surveys will look to define and structure infill and step-out targets out from the known historic and non-compliant resource at the Fitzroy prospect where mineralisation from surface down to ~100m has intercepted grades of 23m @ 1.04g/t and 19m @ 1.21g/t gold.\no\nMapping and sampling will also take place to better define targets along the ~8km Perry Fault at Mt Steadman and target the London and Venus prospects where high grade intercepts included 2m @ 110g/t gold.\n\u00b7\nThese combined activities are designed to bring these targets up to a drill ready stage and expand the resource to be defined across the entire Queensland portfolio, leveraging the strong technical success already demonstrated at Yarrol.\nMark Stephenson, Executive Chairman, commented:\n\"The completion of our diamond drilling programme at Yarrol in early Q4 marked an important milestone for Mila as we accelerate towards the development of an MRE. Initial visual inspections of the core reinforced our confidence in our preliminary geological interpretations and as a result, we made the decision to increase the amount of samples to assay so that we can fully understand the newly defined mineralisation observed in the core.\n\"We now eagerly await the assay results, the first of which we expect imminently, so that we can further refine the project's geological model and finalise drill targets for the RC drilling programme which is now scheduled to commence following the seasonal holiday period. Drilling is the most capital-intensive part of our business, and we are taking the prudent decision schedule the RC programme once the team as adequate time to analyse the DD assays, to ensure a methodical approach to maximise drilling success. Our next objective is to target the higher-grade zones with greater precision, and in turn support the definition of an MRE.\n\"Alongside this, given the success we have had at Yarrol, we are now looking to develop our resource potential across the licence package by developing drill targets at the adjacent properties of Mt Steadman and Monal properties. With existing drilling and historic mining having occurred, the team see a clear pathway to bringing targets on these properties up to a similar stage of technical readiness as Yarrol. We look forward to sharing further updates on these planned work programmes and the Yarrol assay results in due course.\"\n**ENDS**\nFor more information visit www.milaresources.com or contact:\nMark Stephenson\nMila Re",

Following this transaction, we commenced first phase drilling in April 2025 at the Yarrol gold project (\"Yarrol\") and the results proved to be immensely successful, surpassing our expectations with highlights including results of 11m @ 2.91g/t from near surface and 17m @ 5.46g/t from 42m. In light of these highly encouraging results at Yarrol, the Company has notified EMX of its intention to exercise the EMX Option before 31 October 2025 to acquire the licences in Queensland. The Company will be issuing \u00a3110,000 of new ordinary shares to EMX, valued by reference to the volume-weighted average price of the shares during the thirty consecutive trading days prior to the date of issue.\nAs a result of the first phase drilling results at Yarrol, the Company raised further capital to fast-track exploration at Yarrol and begin to explore the wider package of licences in the vicinity. In June 2025, we completed a capital raise of \u00a3776,000 (gross) that was subsequently admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange in July 2025, following the approval of shareholders at a general meeting. We received substantial interest in the capital raise from targeted investors, and our second phase of drilling and exploration at Yarrol is now underway with results anticipated during Q4 2025. Also, we have taken the decision to move away from an \"external consultant\" led exploration model and have invested in our own \"in-house\" exploration team with the recent appointment of Alastair Goodship as Chief Operating Officer and the hiring of a team of geologists in Queensland which will allow us to move faster and efficiently whilst developing more intellectual property in-house.\nTurning to Kathleen Valley (\"KV\"), we continue to see significant potential in the licences for both gold and lithium albeit we have prioritised Yarrol in 2025. KV is located in a highly strategic location with an abundance of gold and lithium infrastructure nearby and we are now evaluating several options on developing KV further. Regrettably, Liontown Resources elected to terminate their option agreement with regard to the lithium exploration in January 2025 against the backdrop of a softer lithium market. We have since received several inbound enquiries for both the gold and lithium potential of these licences, which we are now reviewing. We are confident that KV will unlock value and will update the market once the preferred route is determined.\nWe continue to focus on gold and copper due to the favourable climate for such projects and the level of investor interest for such commodities. Post year-end, gold has traded over $4,300, an all-time high, whilst copper is now nearing $5/lb, approaching its five-year high. We have seen a ",

The new shares will be issued credited as fully paid at a price equal to the volume weighted average price of Mila's ordinary shares during thirty consecutive trading days ending on the day before the share issue.

The encouraging results from our technical team at Yarrol, Mount Steadman and Mount Weary have given us the confidence to exercise the option now and take full ownership. With this in place, we can move ahead with greater flexibility and focus, accelerating our plans to unlock the region's significant gold potential.

DD provides continuous core, enabling the geological team to collect detailed structural, lithological, and alteration data, critical for refining the geological model and improving future drill targeting.\nThe samples from this DD programme are now being prepared for dispatch to an independent laboratory for gold and multi-element analysis. The results will be incorporated into an updated geological model and used to design the forthcoming RC drilling campaign, which is expected to commence before the end of 2025. The RC programme, which uses a larger diameter drill, will provide data focused on defining grade continuity and more cost effectively define ounces contained within the area tested and advance the Company towards defining an updated Mineral Resource Estimate at Yarrol.\nAll activities remain on schedule and within the budget allocated for Phase Two exploration at Yarrol.\nMark Stephenson, Chairman of Mila Resources, commented:\n\"The completion of this diamond drilling campaign marks a significant step forward for Mila at Yarrol. The programme has given us crucial structural data that sharpens our understanding of the mineralisation controls and positions us to target higher-grade zones with greater precision in the next round of drilling. With assays now pending, we look forward to sharing results with our investors and stakeholders in the forthcoming weeks and to advancing swiftly into the RC campaign later this year which is fully funded from our capital raise earlier this year.\"\n**ENDS**\nFor more information visit\nwww.milaresources.com\nor contact:\nMark Stephenson\nMila Resources Plc\ninfo@milaresources.com\nJonathan Evans\nTavira Financial Limited\n+44 (0) 20 7100 5100\nNick Emerson\nSI Capital\n+44 (0) 20 3143 0600\nDamon Heath\nShard Capital Partners LLP\n+44 (0) 20 3971 7000\nSusie Geliher / Will Turner\nSt Brides Partners Limited\n+44 (0) 20 7236 1177\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

These data are intended to inform Mila's understanding of the mineralised system and lay the groundwork for future step-out drilling. Historical scout holes within the southern extension area have already intersected gold mineralisation, extending the system ~2km further to the south; however, systematic exploration is required to \"fill in the gaps\" to package all the targets for the next stage of project development, and unlock the broader strike potential;\nFig.1. Map of Yarrol Project showing the extensions of the ground magnetic survey to the south, and gold intercepts from drilling completed in Stage 1 campaign in 2025.\nii) Review of historical dataset - The Company appointed RSC Mining and Mineral Exploration (\"RSC\"), a leading mining and mineral exploration consultancy, to complete a comprehensive review of historical datasets, interpreted geophysical data, and the results from Mila's successful Phase 1 programme. RSC's work has provided a robust geological framework to guide Mila's systematic, staged exploration strategy, ensuring that Phase 2 drilling maximises resource definition potential and informs subsequent campaigns;\niii) Secured land agreements with stakeholders;\niv) The Company is now finalising drill pad construction and drilling contracts to mobilise rigs to site; and\nv) The Company plans to update the market on results of the recently completed ground geophysics testing the southern extension of Yarrol, the commencement of first-phase exploration activities at the Monal and Mt Steadman properties and progress made in unlocking value across the broader Queensland portfolio.\nMark Stephenson, Executive Chairman, commented:\n\"We have been particularly active in recent months following our successful capital raise in May that will fund the continued drilling and de-risking of Yarrol into 2026. The team at Mila is highly encouraged by the results of the recent geophysical campaign, which has not only generated new targets but also highlighted the potential to expand scale well beyond the areas drilled to date. We are now building a much more detailed picture of the geological model which will help guide and focus the next drilling programme.\n\"In parallel, we have been working closely with RSC to ensure our exploration strategy is both optimised and aligned with building a strong framework for a maiden Mineral Resource Estimate, which we believe will confirm Yarrol's position as an exciting new gold development opportunity to the market.\n\"The next phase is a pivotal step forward as we build on the outstanding success of our initial programme. We are grateful for the continued support of our shareholders and are confident that the capital deployed will build value as we advance and establish Yarrol as a robust gold project.\"\n**ENDS**\nFor more information visit www.milaresources.com or contact:\nMark Stephenson\nMila Resources Plc\ninfo@milaresources.com\nJonathan Evans\nTavira Financial Limited\n+44 (0) 20 7100 5100\nNick Emerson\nSI Capital\n+44 (0) 20 3143 0600\nDamon Heath\nShard Capital Partners LLP\n+44 (0) 20 3971 7000\nSusie Geliher / Will Turner\nSt Brides Partners Limited\n+44 (0) 20 7236 1177\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

We look forward to sharing further updates on our exploration work in due course.\"\nGeophysical studies and structural work\nThe Company has now engaged a geophysical contractor and is scheduled to mobilise on site this week.\nThis work stream will commence with a detailed ground magnetic survey focusing on the southern extension of the Yarrol project. The area includes known mineralisation and historic drill intercepts of 20g/t Au over 12m, within a corridor that remains untested along strike.\nAlso, the Company has engaged a highly experienced resource and structural geology consultancy to undertake a comprehensive review of the historical and recent data sets from Phase 1 exploration. This work will underpin the design of the next drilling campaigns in H2, ensuring a data-driven, technically robust approach.\nOther Work to be completed in H2 2025\nFollowing the completion of the geophysical studies and structural work the Company will be able to commence diamond drilling in Q3 with the aim of understanding the controls on mineralisation at Yarrol, particularly the high grade zones.\nThe Company will also undertake further RC drilling in Q4 to step-out and infill holes at Yarrol. Detailed studies and fieldwork will also be undertaken at the Mt Steadman and Monal licences to advance drill targets. Whilst the immediate focus is to derisk the team's geological model and to continue to achieve strong results from the drill programme, all the drilling from Phase 1 and 2 will contribute towards the maiden mineral resource estimate,\n**ENDS**\nFor more information visit www.milaresources.com or contact:\nMark Stephenson\nMila Resources Plc\ninfo@milaresources.com\nJonathan Evans\nTavira Financial Limited\n+44 (0) 20 7100 5100\nNick Emerson\nSI Capital\n+44 (0) 20 3143 0600\nDamon Heath\nShard Capital Partners LLP\n+44 (0) 20 3971 7000\nSusie Geliher / Will Turner\nSt Brides Partners Limited\n+44 (0) 20 7236 1177\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

This includes step-out holes that extend known zones along strike and at depth and infill holes that confirm historical grades and continuity.\nSome standout intercepts from the campaign include:\n\u00b7\nMYARC0195\n:\n- 2m @ 6.44g/t Au from 124m\n- 1m @ 5.19g/t Au from 117m\n\u00b7\nMYARC0196:\n- 5m @ 2.68g/t Au from 69m- 5m @ 2.53g/t Au from 76m\n\u00b7\nMYARC0197\n:\n- 11m @ 2.91g/t Au from 11m, incl. 1m @ 16.45g/t Au\n- 1m @ 39.10g/t Au from 32m\n- 17m @ 5.46g/t Au from 42m, incl.\n8m @ 9.76g/t Au with 1m @ 47.40g/t Au\n\u00b7\nMYARC0204\n:\n- 15m @ 1.76g/t Au from 101m, incl. 1m @ 16.05g/t Au\n- 4m @ 3.54g/t Au from 133m, incl.\n1m @ 13.05g/t Au\u2003- 6m @ 1.19g/t Au from 152m\nFor further information on these results please refer Mila Resources News releases of 21/05/25 [RNS Number: 5654J] and 06/06/25 [RNS Number: 4878L]\nThese are significant results that speak to the system's scale and its potential to host several high-grade shoots.\nImportantly, many holes intersected multiple mineralised zones at similar depths highlighting strong vertical and lateral continuity, a key feature that demonstrates the potential large-scale of the deposit. The high-grade intercepts in both this drilling campaign and the historic drilling point to a valuable core to the system.\nMila will now undertake detailed structural and technical analysis to pinpoint the controls of the high-grade gold. The updated model from this work will be tested with a targeted diamond drilling, before further drilling is undertaken to complete a maiden JORC-compliant resource.\nNext Phase of Work\nAs a first step, the Company is commissioning a specialist resource geology team to complete a comprehensive review of the existing dataset including recent drilling results. The insights gained will guide the design of the next phase of drilling, with the objective of progressing Yarrol towards a maiden JORC-compliant resource.\nIn parallel, the technical team is ad",

The Placing is conditional on the passing of shareholder resolutions relating to a proposed subdivision of ordinary shares at the General Meeting outlined below.\nUse of Proceeds\nThe proceeds will be applied to accelerate exploration at Yarrol\nfollowing the successful validation of historic data through the H1 2025 drilling program. The Directors intend to extend ground magnetics across approximately 4km of strike. This will inform a detailed structural review before targeted diamond drilling to add detail to our geological model of the deposit.. Also, further work will now be undertaken at the Monal and Mt Steadman properties in order to define drill targets. Moreover, the Company intends to develop its own local subsidiary and geological team to reduce exploration costs and streamline operations generally.\nThe next phase of exploration aims to provide the basis for a de-risked resource drilling programme at Yarrol, while simultaneously progressing drill-ready targets at Mt Steadman and Monal. The mid-term aim is to grow the resource potential as quickly as possible to demonstrate the value of the assets in Queensland.\nMark Sephenson, Executive Director of Mila Resources commented:\n\"We are delighted with strong demand for this fundraise from both existing and new shareholders. We have reported some excellent results from the initial 4 assays at Yarrol and this fundraise will allow us to fast track exploration during H2 2025. This capital will also allow us to begin exploration across the entire package of licences over a strike of 20km. We will be reporting a further 6 assays at Yarrol in the weeks ahead as they return from the laboratories and look forward to moving the project forward.\"\nProposed Subdivision of Ordinary Shares and General Meeting\nThe Companies Act 2006 prohibits the Company from issuing shares at a price below their nominal value. A circular convening a General Meeting will be sent to shareholders in the coming days asking Shareholders to approve resolutions to the following effect:\n(a) that each of the existing Ordinary Shares of 1p be sub-divided into one New Ordinary Share of 0.1p and one Deferred Share of 0.9p; and\n(b) to amend the Company's articles of association to include the rights attaching to the Deferred Shares.\nThe Deferred Shares will not entitle their holders to receive notice of or to attend or vote at any general meeting of the Company, or to receive any dividend or other distribution. On a return of capital on a winding up or dissolution of the Company, the holders of the Deferred Shares shall be entitled to receive an amount equal to the nominal amount paid up thereon, but only after the holders of Ordinary Shares have received \u00a3100,000 per Ordinary Share. The Company shall have the right to purchase the Deferred Shares at any time for no consideration. As such, the Deferred Shares effectively have no value.\nNotice of a General Meeting of the Company, to be held on Monday 7 July 2025 at 10.00 a.m. at Level 1, Devonshire House, 1 Mayfair Place, London W1J 8AJ will be set out in the circular.\nOnce published, the circular will be available to download from the Company's website at www.milaresources.com. It is important that Shareholders lodge their votes electronically in advance of the General Meeting through submission of their proxy votes via the MUFG Investor Centre.\nShareholders are reminded that because the Placing is conditional on the passing of the resolutions to be proposed at the General Meeting. Should the resolutions not be passed, these will not proceed.\nAdmission and Total Voting Rights\nThe Company will seek admission of the Placing Shares to trading on the Equity Shares (Transition) category of the official list and the main market of the London Stock Exchange conditional on the passing of resolutions at the GM. and it is expected that admission will become effective and that dealings in the Placing Shares will commence at 8.00 a.m. on or around 8 July 2025 (\"Admission\").\nFollowing Admission, the total issued share capital of the Company will consist of 649,977,974 Ordinary Shares each with one voting right.

These results bring the total reported to four holes out of ten drilled in the current campaign.\nThe programme is designed to test extensions at depth and along strike of the historic resource envelope in the southern area of the licence, as well as to investigate mineralisation below known intercepts and step out into previously untested parallel zones in the northern area of the licence.\nThe results from holes 3 and 4 continue to build on the initial success at Yarrol (Table 1 and Appendix 1), with these latest intercepts delivering higher grades than historically reported neighbouring holes. The latest results have confirmed multiple mineralised zones and importantly have intercepted mineralisation outside the historical drilled area reinforcing the potential for resource growth at depth (Figures 2 and 3).\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nMYARC0196\nIntercepted:\no\n16m @ 1.83g/t Au from 87m\n\u00a7\nincluding\n5m @ 2.68g/t\nAu which contains\n1m @ 7.17g/t Au\n\u00a7\nand including\n5m @ 2.53g/t Au\n\u00b7\nMYARC0204\nintercepted:\no\n2m @ 0.63g/t Au from 32m\no\n15m @ 1.76g/t Au from 101m\n\u00a7\nIncluding\n1m @ 16.05g/t Au\no\n4m @ 3.54g/t Au from 133m\n\u00a7\nIncluding\n1m @ 13.05g/t Au\no\n6m @ 1.19g/t Au from 152m\n\u00a7\nIncluding\n1m @ 2.01g/t Au\nCut-off grade of 0.3g/t Au and 2m internal dilution applied to intercepts.\nThese results follow the two holes previously announced (21 May 2025) and mark four holes out of ten drilled to date (Figure 1 and Table 2), with assays for the remaining six holes still pending.\nThe programme has already met several key objectives:\n1.\nHigh-grade mineralisation has been intersected in the core of the Yarrol deposit\n, with observations of quartz veining and sulphide rich zones, associated with high grade gold, giving the team further confidence to focus on structural controls as a key vectoring tool for resource growth.\n2.\nHistorical wide intercepts are being replicated\n, providing further validation of the inherited data, including regional scout holes, and supporting the geological model of continuity of mineralisation both along strike and down dip.\n3.\nGold mineralisation, including high-grade zones, continues at depth beyond historical drilling\n, extending the known system and demonstrating clear growth potential down-dip.\nThe team look forward to receiving further results from the six remaining holes, building into the emerging picture of geological continuity.\nMark Stephenson, Executive Director of Mila Resources, commented:\n\"These results are a major win, as they continue to demonstrate the strength and scale of the Yarrol system. With only four holes reported to date, we are already seeing clear evidence that the mineralisation is continuous and extends beyond the footprint of historical drilling. The intercepts confirm that the core of the system hosts high-grade material, and that continuity at depth is real. With six more holes still to come, we are encouraged by what we're seeing and are confident in Yarrol's potential to deliver a much larger gold system.\"\nNext Steps\nThe remaining six holes are currently at the laboratory, with results expected over the coming weeks. Once all assays are received, the Company will look to incorporate these into an updated geological interpretation and begin defining next-phase exploration targets aimed at expanding the mineralised envelope along the Yarrol fault, a 20km long feature.\nAbout the Yarrol Gold Project\nThe Yarrol Project is located in the highly prospective Yarrol Province in Queensland, an emerging gold district host to several known mineralised systems. Mila's initial focus has been on drilling beneath and along strike from historic shallow gold intercepts. The ongoing drill programme is designed to test the continuity, grade, and scale of the gold system, with a view to defining a maiden JORC resource in due course.\nTable 1: Significant Intersections\nHole ID\nWidth\nFrom\nTo\nAu g/t\nMYARC0195\n2m\n100m\n102m\n1.00\n1m\n117m\n118m\n5.19\n2m\n126m\n128m\n6.44\nMYARC0196\n16m\n69m\n85m\n1.83\nincl\n5m\n69m\n74m\n2.68\nwhich incl's\n1m\n70m\n71m\n7.17\nincl\n5m\n76m\n81m\n2.53\nMYARC0197\n11m\n11m\n22m\n2.91\nincl\n1m\n11m\n12m\n16.45\n1m\n32m\n33m\n39.10\n17m\n42m\n59m\n5.47\nincl\n1m\n42m\n43m\n9.25\nand incl\n8m\n51m\n59m\n9.76\nwhich incl's\n1m\n54m\n55m\n47.40\nMYARC0204\n15m\n101m\n116m\n1.76\nincl\n1m\n109m\n110m\n16.05\n4m\n133m\n137m\n3.54\nincl\n1m\n133m\n134m\n13.05\n6m\n152m\n158m\n1.19\nMYARC0198\nResults pending\nMYARC0199\nResults pending\nMYARC0200\nResults pending\nMYARC0201\nResults pending\nMYARC0202\nResults pending\nMYARC0203\nResults pending\nCut-off grade of 0.3g/t Au and 2m internal dilution applied to i",

Each holds historic workings yet are significantly underexplored and represent clear opportunities for discovery and resource growth. This area of Queensland boasts a rich mining heritage and significant ongoing exploration, and Mila's Queensland Portfolio each consisting of multiple targets of Gold, Copper, and other base-metals, each defined at various stages of development, further adding to the project's appeal.\nThe region, which is parallel to the cost and in proximity to good infrastructure connections, spans from the Cracow and Eidsvold goldfields to major porphyry copper systems like Briggs and Mount Cannindah, with gold, copper, and base metals at the forefront of its mining legacy.\nKey highlights of the region's gold mining history include:\n\u00b7\nCracow Gold Mine\n: Operated by Aeris Resources, the high-grade underground operation is known for its consistent output.\n\u00b7\nMount Rawdon\n: A bulk-tonnage open-pit gold mine, operated by Evolution Mining.\n\u00b7\nMount Morgan\n: One of Australia's most historically significant mines, with over eight million ounces of gold and more than 400k tonnes of copper produced to date. The mine, now on C&M is owned by Meritage Minerals who are looking to re-start production in the coming year.\nAt Yarrol a historic, non-JORC resource of circa 100 k oz Gold at 1.5 g/t (un-cut) was defined but only to shallow depths (< 80 m) despite intersections of mineralised structures past 150m and further mineralised bands drilled along strike. Since 1994, gold has surged from US$384/oz to US$3,000/oz, delivering a 6.8% CAGR, far outpacing Australia's 2.5% annual inflation. In this new price environment, and with modern processing technology enabling the recovery of lower-grade mineralisation surrounding the high-grade veins, Yarrol now sits in a fundamentally different economic landscape. What was once considered marginal could now be overlooked value. Small scout drilling programmes took place in the early 2000s. The previous operators drilled a handful of exploration holes before their focus shifted toward a novel cobalt discovery within the license. The gold has been repeatedly overlooked, requiring systematic exploration work and detailed structural integration of the existing data sets, to extrapolating the model down dip and along strike to provide critical scale, ultimately unlocking the full value of the property.\nMt Steadman\nTargeting gold revival as Mila aims to uncover extensive orebody beyond historic mines Mined from the 1920s-1940s with multiple small underground operations.\nMined from the 1920s-1940s with multiple small underground operations.

The use of RC drilling allows for cost-efficient operations whilst delivering large sample volumes, critical for accurately characterising the nuggety nature of gold mineralisation at Yarrol.\nThe rig has now moved north to complete additional holes to test below the known mineralisation and step out into previously untested parallel zones to the historic resource envelope.\nThe Company has sent samples from the initial three holes to the independent laboratory and now awaits the assay results which shall be reported in due course.\nThe Company will update further as the drilling campaign progresses.\nMark Stephenson, Director of Mila Resources:\n\"This initial campaign is the start of a systematic approach to unlocking the Yarrol district. We believe the historic work significantly underestimates the scale of the opportunity here, not only in the high-grade veins, but in the broader halo of mineralisation that could support commercial tonnage. The Yarrol deposit is just the start of a much larger trend that we are only just starting to evaluate. We expect to receive assay results in the coming weeks and progress drilling, and I look forward to reporting these when appropriate.\"\n**ENDS**\nFor more information visit www.milaresources.com or contact:\nMark Stephenson\nMila Resources Plc\ninfo@milaresources.com\nJonathan Evans\nTavira Financial Limited\n+44 (0) 20 7100 5100\nNick Emerson\nSI Capital\n+44 (0) 20 3143 0600\nDamon Heath\nShard Capital Partners LLP\n+44 (0) 20 3971 7000\nSusie Geliher / Charlotte Page\nSt Brides Partners Limited\n+44 (0) 20 7236 1177\nFigure\n1\n.

The drilling campaign has been designed following the completion of a detailed ground magnetic survey, the integration of digitised historic data, and an extensive data interrogation process.\nDrilling contractors are now preparing to mobilise rigs by the end of this month with drill pads expected to be completed in the coming weeks. The Company have been advised that drilling is scheduled to commence in early April notwithstanding any adverse weather conditions that have recently affected the area. The Company expects to receive assay results in mid-Q2 2024.\nExploration Objectives\nThe Company is targeting key geological questions that will shape the future of the Yarrol Project, including:\n1.\nExpansion of Existing Gold Mineralisation:\nAssessing the potential for significant growth in the known gold resource, particularly the continuation of high-grade gold veins at depth below the historically drilled zone (~60m). Additionally, the team is investigating whether the existing low-grade gold halo has been underestimated due to assay methodology limitations. Alternative assaying techniques are being explored to determine whether gold values have historically been understated.\n2.\nGeological Vectoring for Gold Exploration:\nDeveloping a refined geological model to identify gold mineralisation along the full length of the Yarrol Fault. This work is expected to enhance exploration efficiency across the Company's broader portfolio, reducing costs and accelerating resource growth.\nLive Company Presentation\nAdditionally, the Company plans to present an in-depth update on the Yarrol Gold Project and the upcoming drilling campaign via Investor Meet Company on Wednesday 26 March 2025 at 17:00 GMT.\nThe presentation is open to all existing and potential shareholders. Questions can be submitted pre-event via the Investor Meet Company dashboard up until 25 March 2025, 09:00 GMT, or at any time during the live presentation.\nInvestors can sign up to Investor Meet Company for free and add to meet Mila via:\nhttps://www.investormeetcompany.com/mila-resources-plc/register-investor\nInvestors who already follow Mila on the Investor Meet Company platform will automatically be invited.\nMila Resources remains committed to unlocking the full potential of the Yarrol Gold Project and looks forward to updating shareholders as the drill programme progresses.\nMark Stephenson, Director of Mila Resources:\n\"We are delighted to have now got to the phase where we are ready to drill at Yarrol. Our team has worked hard on reviewing and evaluating the data, both new and old, ahead of this drill programme and we are highly encouraged with the geological model thus far. We now look forward to completing the drilling in April and following up with assays.\"\nFigure\n1\n.

The Option must be exercised within 12 months. However, any further payments are subject to exploration and development success.\n\u00b7\nMila has defined a targeted development strategy which is initially focussed on Yarrol; the project hosts a non-JORC compliant gold resource and has been historically under-explored.\n\u00b7\nGeophysics studies have provided valuable insight into key mineralised features along a 2km section of the ~20km-long Yarrol Fault.\n\u00b7\nTargeted drilling campaign planned to commence in Q2 to test priority areas at Yarrol.\n\u00b7\nAcquisition complements existing interest in the Kathleen Valley Gold Project in Western Australia.\n\u00b7\nCash position of \u00a3951,845 as at 31 December\n2024.\n\u00b7\nLoss for the six-month period ended 31 December of \u00a3360,727 (2023:\n\u00a3\n321,436\n).\nChairman\nStatement\nMila's strategy has been focused on targeting mining projects with robust geological potential in proven mining regions, which we can then advance and ultimately build value. During the six months ended 31 December 2024, the Company identified an opportunity and entered into an option agreement to explore three highly prospective gold and copper projects in Queensland to complement our existing interest in the Kathleen Valley Gold Project ('Kathleen Valley') in Western Australia.\nThis acquisition was carefully structured to minimise upfront costs for Mila, so that our investment was focussed on exploration whilst milestone acquisition payments are linked to subsequent geological success and development.\nThe new projects in Queensland, Yarrol, Mt Steadman and Monal, provide Mila are gold and copper led projects. Yarrol is currently our primary focus and has a non-JORC compliant gold resource. We are particularly drawn to the significant upside potential along the ~20km-long Yarrol Fault that is believed to be associated with a larger gold mineralising system and accordingly we are now focusing our exploration activity on this area. Historical geophysical data covering a 2km section of this fault has been reviewed and analysed by our technical team, and priority drilling targets are now being confirmed for Q2 this year. The upcoming Phase 1 drill programme at Yarrol is fully funded from existing cash resources.\nOn a wider corporate level, we have undertaken a review of our cost base and since the beginning of 2025 our cost base has been reduced materially. We are fully funded to progress the EMX Option (see RNS dated 31 October 2024) and will continue to update shareholders as exploration activity unfolds in Queensland.\nPost period end, as shareholders will be aware, we received notification that Liontown Resources Limited is no longer pursuing the lithium rights at our Kathleen Valley Project. Whilst this news was understandably disappointing, they have provided us with a significant amount of information and data, which we are in the process of evaluating and will be of great value as we determine best next steps at the project. Kathleen Valley has proven gold occurrences, offers promising lithium and tantalum grades, and is located in the tier-one Wiluna-Norseman gold belt surrounded by major mining operators.\nLooking ahead, the upcoming months are set to be increasingly active as we commence drilling at Yarrol. We have worked hard to ensure our Company has strong foundations for growth and with our multi-commodity portfolio, targeted development approach and solid cash position we are now ready to deliver results and build value. I look forward to sharing our progress with you and would like to take this opportunity to thank our shareholders for their continued support.\nFinance and\nCorporate\nResults\nThe interim results for the six months to 31 December 2024 show a loss of \u00a3360,727 (2023:\n\u00a3\n321,436\n).\nCash\nPosition\nAt 31 December 2024, cash and cash equivalents amounted to \u00a3951,845 (2023: \u00a31,684,073).\nDirectors\nMark Stephenson\nNeil Hutchison\nJonathan Evans (appointed 19 December 2024)\nLee Daniels (resigned 5 November 2024)\nLindsay Mair (resigned 19 December 2024)\nCorporate\nGovernance\nThe UK Corporate Governance Code (September 2014) (\"the Code\"), as appended to the Listing Rules, sets out the Principles of Good Corporate Governance a",

Mila's team interprets this as evidence that mineralising fluids have altered the host rock, reducing its magnetic signature, providing a valuable exploration vector. While some high-grade gold intercepts occur outside these zones, further investigation is planned to understand their significance.\nNext Steps: Focused Drilling Campaign\nMila is now designing a targeted drilling campaign to:\n\u00b7\nExtend grade continuity within the historical resource area. Mineralised structures were identified during previous drilling but not further tested along strike or at depth;\n\u00b7\nExpand the footprint by initially focusing on the Yarrol North and Central targets, before stepping out and testing new targets of gold mineralisation along the Yarrol Fault; and\n\u00b7\nLeverage new geological insights as any discovery will be a key to unlocking a step-change in the gold resource potential.\nMila is well-positioned to advance Yarrol and unlock the broader gold potential of its Queensland Portfolio with a refined exploration model and a clear path to earning into 100% ownership.\nMark Stephenson, Director of Mila Resources:\n\"Initial findings at Yarrol are encouraging and we are confident that this property has significant gold resource potential over and above that declared historically.

With promising lithium and tantalum grades in grab samples in addition to known gold occurrences in the north of the property, the Mila team will begin evaluating the wider strategy for the Kathleen Valley project. The Company is now undertaking a busy period completing geophysical surveys over the Yarrol Property, leading up to a infill and step out drilling programme with the objective of upgrading the historic resource to JORC compliance and testing extensions to known mineralisation. Desktop reviews are also underway on the Mt Steadman and Monal properties, building up to larger regional surveys and exploration campaigns in the coming year.\nMark Stephenson, Director of Mila Resources:\n\"While today's news is understandably disappointing, we now need time to review the options at Kathleen Valley. We are pursuing a multi asset portfolio for these reasons, to mitigate risk particularly for early-stage exploration projects. We remain highly optimistic about our broader portfolio, which now encompasses four distinct exploration properties. In particular, our work at Yarrol is showing promising early results, and we look forward to updating the market with further developments in the weeks and months ahead.\"\n**ENDS**\nFor more information visit www.milaresources.com or contact:\nMark Stephenson\nMila Resources Plc\ninfo@milaresources.com\nJonathan Evans\nTavira Financial Limited\n+44 (0) 20 7100 5100\nNick Emerson\nSI Capital\n+44 (0) 20 3143 0600\nDamon Heath\nShard Capital Partners LLP\n+44 (0) 20 3971 7000\nSusie Geliher / Charlotte Page\nSt Brides Partners Limited\n+44 (0) 20 7236 1177\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

This review identified priority targets of gold, copper and other base metals, which have been ranked for follow-up exploration.\nThe team subsequently conducted a site visit in November 2024 to assess ground access and initiate communications with local stakeholders. Notably, the Yarrol property has emerged as the most advanced target within the portfolio. Historic drilling across approximately 4 km of strike includes a 2 km section incorporated into a non-JORC-compliant historic resource. The target contains multiple, near surface drill intercepts including:\n\u00b7\n12m @ 20g/t gold\n\u00b7\n44m @ 2.34g/t gold\n\u00b7\n40m @ 2.80g/t gold\nThe Mila team sees immediate value in:\n\u00b7\nUpgrading targets to a drill ready stage with detailed geophysical surveys.\n\u00b7\nInfill drilling to upgrade the historic resource to JORC compliance.\n\u00b7\nStep-out drilling to test the prospective ~7 km of geochemically defined anomalies within a broader ~20 km geologically prospective strike.\nGround Magnetic Survey at Yarrol\nIn December 2024, the Company commissioned a ground magnetic survey at the Yarrol property, improving the definition of structural features associated with the gold mineralisation of the Yarrol target. This survey, currently ongoing, is expected to be completed in the coming weeks. The results will form the foundation for Mila's maiden drilling campaign on the property.\nThe Company is also completing the digitisation and detailed interrogation of historic data from Yarrol. This comprehensive analysis, combined with the interpretation of geophysical survey results, will guide efforts to target extensions to the known mineralisation and identify additional prospective zones.\nMt Steadman and Monal\nAt Mt Steadman and Monal, ongoing desktop studies are reviewing historic data, including previous shallow mine workings, drilling, soil sampling, and grab samples, which highlight zones of high potential. However, being these properties are less advanced, development campaign work be deferred in line with the Company's capital allocation and value creation strategy.\nKathleen Valley Gold and Lithium Projects\nExploration at Kathleen Valley is being advanced through an earn-in arrangement with Liontown Resources. In late 2024, Liontown conducted a scouting exploration campaign in collaboration with the Tjiwarl people, the Traditional Owners of the land.\nKey highlights from this campaign include:\n\u00b7\nIdentification of zones prospective for lithium, tin, and tantalum.\n\u00b7\nConfirmation of mineral zonation indicative of LCT-pegmatite systems.\nThe Mila team is reviewing these results and remains in close communication with Liontown as further exploration progresses. Gold targets within the Kathleen Valley license remain secondary to the ongoing work on lithium prospects and are not allocated capital in the near term as per Mila's capital allocation and value appreciation strategy.\nMark Stephenson, Director of Mila Resources:\n\"Our disciplined and methodical approach ensures that capital invested is directed toward de-risking assets and enhancing shareholder value. With a focus on advanced exploration targets like Yarrol and strategic partnerships like Liontown, Mila is poised to deliver tangible results while adhering to best practices in sustainability and capital allocation.\"\n**ENDS**\nFor more information visit www.milaresources.com or contact:\nMark Stephenson\nMila Resources Plc\ninfo@milaresources.com\nJonathan Evans\nTavira Financial Limited\n+44 (0) 20 7100 5100\nNick Emerson\nSI Capital\n+44 (0) 20 3143 0600\nDamon Heath\nShard Capital Partne",

A total of 15 samples were taken of in-situ pegmatite veins\nby joint venture partner, Liontown, with results pending.\nThe programme was completed alongside the Tjiwarl people following extensive communication and engagement with the Tjiwarl Aboriginal Corporation. Through close collaboration, Liontown identified areas where geological sampling could proceed while protecting culturally sensitive zones.\nThe results of the sampling programme are expected to bolster results from previous exploration work undertaken by Liontown and previous operators, which has included mapping, soil sampling and aerial image surveying, in order to refine the geological model for Kathleen Valley and determine the most prospective targets for future exploration.\nMark Stephenson, Director of Mila Resources:\n\"We are delighted to receive this positive update from Liontown, both that their communication and relationship with the Tjiwarl peoples is good, having allowed the team to take samples, and to see their exploration plans for our licence to take shape. We continue to stay in close contact with Liontown as they focus in on defining the southern extension of the Kathaleen Valley pegmatite belt, revealing the potential of the pegmatite swarms hosted on our land package.

These results highlight significant gold and copper mineralisation across multiple targets, highlighting the mineralised potential of Mila's expanded portfolio.\nHighlights:\n\u2022\nMonal Target\n(Monal Licence)\n:\nRock chip sampling of copper-sulphide ore returned a peak value of 26.8 g/t Au and 0.88% Cu, underscoring the high-grade gold and copper potential at Monal.\n\u2022\nRawlins Target\n(Monal Licence)\n:\nSampling of a haematite breccia at the Rawlins Target produced a remarkable result of 24.6 g/t Au and 5.48% Cu, indicating the potential for high-grade polymetallic mineralisation at this target.\n\u2022\nYarrol Target\n(Yarrol Licence)\n:\nSampling efforts returned peak values of 6.49 g/t Au and 2.69% Cu within the historic resource area, with additional sampling outside the main historic resource area yielding 0.68 g/t Au and 1.95% Cu-an encouraging sign of further resource potential in surrounding areas.\nFurther Information\nThe rock chips reported today were collected during recent site visit as part of the due diligence process and relationship building between Mila and local stakeholders.\nThis field visit, led by Exploration Manager Alastair Goodship, formed a critical component of Mila's due diligence process, providing essential \"ground truthing\" and validation of existing exploration data. The Mila team is currently developing and testing various geological models across the licences, which are essential to understanding the full value of the properties. Site visits also enabled the team to assess the physical topography firsthand, revealing good access to the properties via main roadways and existing tracks. This level of access is an important logistical advantage for Mila's future exploration activities.\nIn addition to technical assessments, Mila's team engaged with local stakeholders, including landowners, to build the relationships necessary to advance its work programmes in Queensland responsibly. Open communication and stakeholder engagement remain central to Mila's commitment to a community-oriented approach to project development.\nNext Steps:\nMila Resources is now tendering with geophysical consultants to conduct a ground survey across key targets within its Queensland Projects. These surveys will provide deeper insights into the subsurface structure and mineralised potential, supporting Mila's systematic approach to defining high-priority targets. Mila aims to commence these surveys as soon as possible and will update the market accordingly.\nMark Stephenson, Director of Mila Resources:\n\"I am delighted to report our first exploration update from our new projects, little over a week after signing the option agreement to acquire them. This demonstrates both our commitment to moving quickly with our work programmes in Queensland, and also our confidence in our ability to rapidly build tangible value across our expanded portfolio of interests.\n\"Today's findings, along with the ground truthing and geological models we are developing, confirm the substantial potential of these projects. As we continue to engage with local stakeholders and expand our understanding of the properties, we are well-positioned to advance our exploration programmes and unlock the value of these high-grade gold and copper assets. This is an exciting time for Mila as we move towards the next phase of development and exploration in Queensland.\"\nAlastair Goodship, Exploration Manager:\n\"While these rock chip samples were selective and taken from known pits, so the presence of gold wasn't a surprise, it was very encouraging to see the clear extension of the existing resource and shallow mine workings. This validates our geological models and supports our belief in the significant potential of these projects. Additionally, the easy access to the land was a real positive, providing a solid foundation for efficient exploration. We are excited to continue building relationships with local stakeholders as we systematically develop the properties and advance our work programmes in the region.\"\nFig.1.

Mark has already made reference to this in the video interview he gave in May and is conscious of MILA be bought on the cheap. Hence why they are working very hard to get a maiden Jorc resource early this year established and deliver shareholder value on that front, so that if bids do start coming in we receive fair value.

Here\u2019s a straight, evidence-based assessment of the December 8, 2025 diamond drill results from MILA\u2019s Yarrol Project \u2014 and whether they represent a meaningful step-out from earlier drilling. \u2e3b \ud83d\udccc Summary of the December 2025 RNS results MILA released its first assays from the six-hole diamond drilling campaign completed in October 2025 at Yarrol. These are from hole MYADD0205, the first of the six.  \ufffc Key intercepts from hole MYADD0205: \u2022\t5 m @ 2.78 g/t Au from 183 m \u2022\tIncludes 1 m @ 6.89 g/t Au \u2022\tAnd 1 m @ 6.39 g/t Au \u2022\t2.19 m @ 1.10 g/t Au from 170.44 m \u2022\tIf you account for lower-grade zones between higher ones, the hole returns: \u2022\t14 m @ ~1.14 g/t Au (cut-off 0.2 g/t)  \ufffc These intercepts extend mineralisation below and beyond the earlier, mostly RC drilling footprint.  \ufffc \u2e3b \ud83d\udccc Were these step-outs meaningful? Yes \u2014 from the context of earlier drilling: \ud83d\udd39 Different hole type + depth \u2022\tThe earlier drilling in 2025 was largely RC (reverse circulation) testing shallow and intermediate targets on/near the historic zone and along strike.  \ufffc \u2022\tThe diamond programme was designed to test depth continuity and structure in three dimensions \u2014 something RC alone does poorly.  \ufffc This first diamond hole shows: \u2022\tMineralisation continues to ~200 m vertical depth \u2022\tMineralised structures persist outside the historic shallow envelope \u2022\tDiamond core provides geological confirmation of vein geometry, not just assays That is exactly the purpose of diamond drilling before an MRE \u2014 to confirm the continuity and geometry of the ore system.  \ufffc \ud83d\udd39 Step-out context The RNS explicitly states the hole lies outside the historic resource and beyond where RC drilling had been done.  \ufffc So it is a step-out confirmation \u2014 not simply an infill \u2014 and it traced mineralisation continuously from surface through multiple intercepts to ~200 m depth.  \ufffc \u2e3b \ud83d\udccc Grade interpretation The results show two types of evidence: \ud83d\udc4d High-grade spikes \u2022\t1 m @ 6.89 g/t \u2022\t1 m @ 6.39 g/t These are narrow but meaningful high-grade \u201cshoots\u201d \u2014 typical for orogenic/intrusion-related gold and important for economics.  \ufffc \ud83d\udccf Broader mineralised interval \u2022\t14 m @ ~1.14 g/t Au (0.2 g/t cut-off) This indicates a significant bulk halo of mineralisation, which helps add tonnage potential beyond narrow veins.  \ufffc Both styles (narrow high grade + broader moderate grade) are good signs for building a resource that has both shape and scale. \u2e3b \ud83d\udccc Why these results matter geologically 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Vertical continuity The RNS highlights that the mineralisation can be traced from surface to ~200 m depth and is not a shallow \u201ccap.\u201d  \ufffc That\u2019s crucial for resource confidence",

Reasons for Delays The delays are generally caused by a combination of factors affecting the entire Australian gold sector, not just Queensland: High Demand: A surge in gold exploration and new projects across Australia has increased the volume of samples sent to laboratories. Skills and Labour Shortages: The industry has experienced a lack of skilled labour, from drilling operators to laboratory technicians, which slows down the entire process. Supply Chain and Cost Pressures: General inflationary pressures on input costs and supply chain issues can affect laboratory operations and efficiency. Traditional Methods: Conventional fire assay, while an industry standard, is a multi-step process that can take days or weeks for results, especially with high volumes.",

          "content": "Yes, fire assay backlogs for gold explorers in Queensland are affected by high demand from the broader mining industry which includes explorers for other minerals, as well as general issues like labor shortages. The fire assay method is the industry standard for determining concentrations of not just gold, but also other valuable platinum group elements (PGEs) like platinum, palladium, iridium, osmium, and ruthenium. Therefore, the overall high volume of exploration and mining activities across various commodities, including base metals and critical minerals (many of which are found in Queensland), contributes to the backlog in assay laboratories. Key factors contributing to assay backlogs include: High overall exploration activity: Surges in exploration across all minerals, driven by global demand and prices, put immense pressure on lab capacity. Labor shortages: Post-COVID labour shortages have significantly impacted the ability of labs to process samples quickly. Time-consuming process: The traditional fire assay method is a complex and lengthy process involving high heat and hazardous chemicals, making it difficult to ramp up capacity quickly. Supply chain issues: Tangled supply chains for necessary lab equipment and chemicals can also cause delays. The high volume of samples from all types of mining operations means that the backlog is a shared challenge across the entire mining industry, not exclusive to gold miners. Some labs are turning to newer technologies like PhotonAssay to help alleviate these delays. GLA",

There will be capex for access drives on the hanging wall side, I would have progressed from proceeds as each section is mined.

The programme successfully demonstrated the continuity of gold-bearing structures, with intercepts of ~5g/t gold traced from surface to ~230 metres depth and provided critical insight into the structural architecture of the system. These results, which did not deliver the grades anticipated at depth, has allowed the technical team to further refine the Company's geological model for Yarrol.\nWhile depth extensions along the Yarrol Fault corridor warrant further work over the medium term, the most compelling and capital efficient near-term opportunity lies in testing shallow targets along strike across the Yarrol, Monal and Mt Steadman licences. The Company remains fully funded and on track to commence RC drilling at Yarrol in Q1 2026.\nOverview\n\u00b7\nDiamond drilling, chosen to define structure, has confirmed continuity of gold-bearing features from surface to ~300m depth, though high-grade intercepts were less consistent at depth than in shallow zones.\n\u00b7\nThe programme successfully intercepted gold structures throughout the tested depth range and confirmed grades of up to 5 g/t gold at depth, validating the mineralised system's scale, however, mineralisation between 230m and 300m was lower grade and/or sporadic in holes MYDD207, MYDD208, MYD209 and MYDD210.\n\u00b7\nHole MYDD205 confirmed northern extension to gold mineralisation beyond the historic resource area, building upon the earlier RC drilling.\n\u00b7\nThe Gold-bearing structures have been confirmed to be continuous and repetitive along strike, increasing confidence in the scale of the system.\n\u00b7\nMila will now pursue additional near surface targets alongside historical resources with the objective of generating multiple shallow (to a depth of 150m) prospects featuring broad gold zones that can be efficiently tested and advanced towards potential production.\nMark Stephenson, Managing Director of Mila Resources, commented:\n\"The recent diamond drilling programme has given us highly valuable information regarding the continuity of our gold system at depth which will help us understand structures controlling gold mineralisation, and provide the data needed to make informed decisions about our next exploration programme. The grades were lower than anticipated albeit they confirmed that gold structures extend well below surface, with grades of 5 g/t still present at depth; an important validation of the system's scale.\n\"Following the DD programme, the most compelling near-term opportunity for the Company is to drill shallow targets along strike across the Yarrol, Monal and Mt Steadman licences. These include multiple high-quality untested targets alongside historical resources that can be tested in a low-risk and capital-efficient manner.\n\"We've only just started to explore this licence package, and we are not reliant on a single target or orebody but a portfolio of targets at Yarrol. We continue to systematically test a highly prospective district with proven gold endowment, and we are focussed on building a mineral resource of scale to move to development. The geological insights from this programme will strengthen our targeting as we move forward to the RC drilling programme that is scheduled to begin next month and more generally our resource expansion programme this year.\"\nFurther Information\nThe Company's maiden DD programme was designed to target potential extensions at depth of known mineralisation at Yarrol Central and Ridge, covering approximately 2km of the 20km Yarrol Fault corridor.\nThe diamond drilling programme successfully intercepted gold structures throughout the tested depth range and confirmed grades of up to 6.8 g/t gold at depth, demonstrating that the gold system remains active below the shallow oxide zone.\nThe high-grade intercepts became less frequent at depth compared to the Company's earlier shallow reverse circulation (RC) drilling results. To investigate whether this reflected true geological variation or a sampling issue, the Company deployed advanced photon assay technology on selected samples. While photon assays showed modest grade improvements in some intervals, results confirmed that gold distribution does change with depth, most likely reflecting natural geological zonation, structural complexity, or the transition from bulk RC sampling to narrow diamond core in a nuggety gold system.\nDrill Hole\nIntercept\nMYADD205\n1m @ 6.8 g/t Au from 183 m\n1m @ 6.3 g/t Au from 187m\n1.2m @ 1.1 g/t Au from",

Even 100k oz you could argue should be worth at least \u00a310m but I just don\u2019t see how it could be such a low resource with current results. And then MILA is not just about Yarrol they have Mt Monal and Kathleen valley.

For a small company they've spent money on exploring what was below the oxides. 2 types of drilling RC and DD, the first one mixes up the ore so the geological makeup is lost, the definitive geological modelling will come from the DD. We have oxide in the shallow zones and \"nuggetty\" geology at depth, so there's 2 separate processing requirements. It makes sense therefore to concentrate on the shallower targets before going deeper when more cash will be at hand. Overall I'm optimistic for the potential.",

Something like blast stoping for this part of the ore body. It's looks to be a long mineralised fault line possibly 10m wide at the top to about 30m wide at 100m depth before carrying on downwards. There will be capex for access drives on the hanging wall side, I would have progressed from proceeds as each section is mined. All hypothetical at the moment for me as there's not enough information published yet but enough for them to have some idea in the mine plan.",

Not a reason to hold them back so am confident this is not the case. The suggestion yesterday they will release good and bad ones together is more likely imo. The explanation that the delays are because there is a backlog AND we are behind much bigger operators is also entirely plausible too.",

The base case which they hope to expand on is: Yarrol 100k oz Mt Steadman 35k oz Monal 20k oz Kathleen valley (30% owned of 21k oz) = 7k oz So base case is around 160k oz treating the current Yarrol results as if they didn\u2019t exist. So the current mcap is not compatible with 160k oz of gold already. Just market shenanigans.",

I think that means the really hard bear case is 200k oz MRE at absolute worst. Even that should justify an mcap of around \u00a320m which is 3x from here. Even 100k oz you could argue should be worth at least \u00a310m but I just don\u2019t see how it could be such a low resource with current results. And then MILA is not just about Yarrol they have Mt Monal and Kathleen valley. Even if they could get just a measly 50k oz from each we\u2019re back to a \u00a320m mcap as a real ultra hard bear case.",

We have oxide in the shallow zones and \"nuggetty\" geology at depth, so there's 2 separate processing requirements. It makes sense therefore to concentrate on the shallower targets before going deeper when more cash will be at hand. Overall I'm optimistic for the potential.",

There will be capex for access drives on the hanging wall side, I would have progressed from proceeds as each section is mined.

Even 100k oz you could argue should be worth at least \u00a310m but I just don\u2019t see how it could be such a low resource with current results. And then MILA is not just about Yarrol they have Mt Monal and Kathleen valley.

For a small company they've spent money on exploring what was below the oxides. 2 types of drilling RC and DD, the first one mixes up the ore so the geological makeup is lost, the definitive geological modelling will come from the DD. We have oxide in the shallow zones and \"nuggetty\" geology at depth, so there's 2 separate processing requirements. It makes sense therefore to concentrate on the shallower targets before going deeper when more cash will be at hand. Overall I'm optimistic for the potential.",

There will be capex for access drives on the hanging wall side, I would have progressed from proceeds as each section is mined.

And two more even further extensions have been identified, Ext-S and Starlight. The deep DD results add a minimum of 50k oz on top based on current results.

Even 100k oz you could argue should be worth at least \u00a310m but I just don\u2019t see how it could be such a low resource with current results. And then MILA is not just about Yarrol they have Mt Monal and Kathleen valley.

For a small company they've spent money on exploring what was below the oxides. 2 types of drilling RC and DD, the first one mixes up the ore so the geological makeup is lost, the definitive geological modelling will come from the DD. We have oxide in the shallow zones and \"nuggetty\" geology at depth, so there's 2 separate processing requirements. It makes sense therefore to concentrate on the shallower targets before going deeper when more cash will be at hand. Overall I'm optimistic for the potential.",
