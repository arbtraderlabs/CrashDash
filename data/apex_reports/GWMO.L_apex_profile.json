This work followed anomalous soil sampling results reported in October and the Company considers that these trench samples have strong potential to confirm zones of broad and consistent tungsten mineralisation.\nInitial observations from the trenching programme are highly encouraging and the samples have been dispatched to a laboratory for assay. The results are expected during January and could be used in the design of an early drill programme.\nDevelopment of a tungsten asset is aligned with US demand for secure domestic supplies of critical and strategic minerals.\nCommenting on the year, Brian Hall,\u00a0Executive Chairman\u00a0of Great Western Mining, said:\n\"2025 was a year of solid exploration progress for Great Western, involving copper, precious metals and tungsten. Our drilling campaigns at the West Huntoon copper prospect and the Rhyolite Dome gold prospect were completed as planned, with laboratory assays currently awaited. At West Huntoon and Defender-Pine Crow we have conducted extensive surface sampling and the recent machine-cut channel samples taken at Defender-Pine Crow in December will greatly add to our understanding of the tungsten potential there, which we expect will confirm zones of tungsten mineralisation. We have effectively strengthened our exposure to the minerals that are becoming increasingly important to domestic US supply chains, and we are eager to see the Pine Crow-Defender assay results.\n\"We will enter the new year well positioned to build on this momentum and unlock value across the portfolio.\"\n**ENDS**\nFor further information visit www.greatwesternmining.com or contact:\nGreat Western Mining Corporation PLC\nBrian Hall,\u00a0Chairman\nc/o St Brides\nMax Williams, Finance Director\ngreatwesternmining@stbridespartners.co.uk\nDavy\nNominated Adviser,\u00a0Euronext Growth Adviser & Joint Broker\nBrian Garrahy\n+353 (0)1 679 6363\nShard Capital Partners\nJoint Broker\nAndrew Gutmann / Erik\u00a0Woolgar\n+44 (0)20 7186 9008\nSt\u00a0Brides\u00a0Partners\nFinancial PR\nSusie\u00a0Geliher\u00a0/ Isabel de Salis\u00a0/ Will Turner\ngreatwesternmining@stbridespartners.co.uk\nNotes\nGreat Western Mining Corporation PLC\n(AIM: GWMO\u00a0/\u00a0Euronext Growth: 8GW) is a diversified exploration and development company focused on strategic\u00a0minerals\u00a0across\u00a0several\u00a0100%-owned claim groups in Mineral County, Nevada,\u00a0one of the world's most prolific and mining-friendly\u00a0jurisdictions.

These results are particularly encouraging, revealing a clear geochemical link between the outcropping tungsten-rich Defender and Pine Crow workings and our established copper resource at M2. The consistency and scale of these anomalies suggest the presence of a significantly larger mineralised system than previously recognised. We will now initiate targeted geological fieldwork and follow-up sampling to delineate the extent of tungsten, copper and zinc mineralisation, with the aim of advancing these zones towards a new drilling campaign.\nBACKGROUND\nThe Defender and Pine Crow skarns, which are thought to have produced tungsten during World War II, lie approximately 2 km northeast of and on trend with the Company's M2 skarn copper resource. These outcropping skarns occur at the contact zones of Cretaceous granitic intrusions with limestones of the Jurassic Dunlap Formation. Earlier field mapping and rock chip sampling confirmed scheelite-bearing skarns at both Defender and Pine Crow, with rock chip samples recording up to 1.75% tungsten trioxide (WO3) (see RNS dated 16 June 2025).\nThe purpose of the summer 2025 soil sampling campaign was to test for extensions of mineralisation in the vicinity of the previously mined Pine Crow/Defender tungsten skarn workings and the Company's nearby copper resource at the M2 skarn.\n98 soil samples were collected across 198 acres (0.8 km2) between Defender/Pine Crow and the Company's previous soil sample grid at M2. Elevated tungsten (W), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) in soil results were traced for approximately 1.4 km along the granite-limestone contact zone. Five samples from the contact zone were greater than 75 ppm Cu, with one sample containing 385 ppm Cu. Zn in soil is elevated up to 81 ppm Zn in the contact zone compared to <40 ppm away from the contact. W in soil is elevated up to 6 ppm in the contact zone, compared to background values of <1 ppm W in soil away from the contact zone. Due to its refractory nature, W concentration is also likely to have been under-represented by the aqua regia digest method used in the lab analysis. When correlating trends with the Company's historically reported soil sample grid in the M2 area, elevated W, Cu and Zn in soils can be traced for over 2.8 km in strike length, from south of the M2 resource to Pine Crow.\nThe spatial extent of these results highlights the potential scale of the mineralising system and indicates correlation between the M2 copper skarn resource and the tungsten rich skarns in the Pine Crow/Defender area. In the short term, the Company will follow up with infill soil sampling analysis together with detailed geological mapping for a better evaluation of further skarn-mineralisation in the area and to delineate areas for geophysical surveys and channel sampling. The results of this work will guide the generation of drill targets.\nFigure 1: Map of the\u00a0Pine Crow/Defender area showing\u00a0W (ppm) in soil samples, from this sampling campaign\u00a0and previous sampling campaigns from the M2 area, and previously reported W (ppm) in rock chip samples.\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nAll soil samples were processed by ALS laboratories, Reno, Nevada. Samples were screened to -80 mesh and analysed by method AuME-TL43, aqua regia digest with ICP-MS finish. Quality control samples were inserted by the Company and results reviewed prior to release.\nQUALIFIED PERSON STATEMENT\nThe information in this announcement that relates to exploration results is based on information reviewed by Dr Lawrence Carter MSc PhD MAusIMM who is an Independent Geological Consultant.
