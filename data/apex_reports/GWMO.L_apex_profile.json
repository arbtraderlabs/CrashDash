Our next round of exploration activities will be guided by the assay results from our drilling at West Huntoon and Rhyolite Dome, which we will be receiving in the coming weeks. In the meantime, we are aiming to maintain momentum at our tungsten prospects following highly encouraging anomalous soil sample results released last month. Always subject to weather conditions in the field, we aim to conduct initial trench sampling before year-end and are funded for this work.

These results are particularly encouraging, revealing a clear geochemical link between the outcropping tungsten-rich Defender and Pine Crow workings and our established copper resource at M2. The consistency and scale of these anomalies suggest the presence of a significantly larger mineralised system than previously recognised. We will now initiate targeted geological fieldwork and follow-up sampling to delineate the extent of tungsten, copper and zinc mineralisation, with the aim of advancing these zones towards a new drilling campaign.\nBACKGROUND\nThe Defender and Pine Crow skarns, which are thought to have produced tungsten during World War II, lie approximately 2 km northeast of and on trend with the Company's M2 skarn copper resource. These outcropping skarns occur at the contact zones of Cretaceous granitic intrusions with limestones of the Jurassic Dunlap Formation. Earlier field mapping and rock chip sampling confirmed scheelite-bearing skarns at both Defender and Pine Crow, with rock chip samples recording up to 1.75% tungsten trioxide (WO3) (see RNS dated 16 June 2025).\nThe purpose of the summer 2025 soil sampling campaign was to test for extensions of mineralisation in the vicinity of the previously mined Pine Crow/Defender tungsten skarn workings and the Company's nearby copper resource at the M2 skarn.\n98 soil samples were collected across 198 acres (0.8 km2) between Defender/Pine Crow and the Company's previous soil sample grid at M2. Elevated tungsten (W), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) in soil results were traced for approximately 1.4 km along the granite-limestone contact zone. Five samples from the contact zone were greater than 75 ppm Cu, with one sample containing 385 ppm Cu. Zn in soil is elevated up to 81 ppm Zn in the contact zone compared to <40 ppm away from the contact. W in soil is elevated up to 6 ppm in the contact zone, compared to background values of <1 ppm W in soil away from the contact zone. Due to its refractory nature, W concentration is also likely to have been under-represented by the aqua regia digest method used in the lab analysis. When correlating trends with the Company's historically reported soil sample grid in the M2 area, elevated W, Cu and Zn in soils can be traced for over 2.8 km in strike length, from south of the M2 resource to Pine Crow.\nThe spatial extent of these results highlights the potential scale of the mineralising system and indicates correlation between the M2 copper skarn resource and the tungsten rich skarns in the Pine Crow/Defender area. In the short term, the Company will follow up with infill soil sampling analysis together with detailed geological mapping for a better evaluation of further skarn-mineralisation in the area and to delineate areas for geophysical surveys and channel sampling. The results of this work will guide the generation of drill targets.\nFigure 1: Map of the\u00a0Pine Crow/Defender area showing\u00a0W (ppm) in soil samples, from this sampling campaign\u00a0and previous sampling campaigns from the M2 area, and previously reported W (ppm) in rock chip samples.\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nAll soil samples were processed by ALS laboratories, Reno, Nevada. Samples were screened to -80 mesh and analysed by method AuME-TL43, aqua regia digest with ICP-MS finish. Quality control samples were inserted by the Company and results reviewed prior to release.\nQUALIFIED PERSON STATEMENT\nThe information in this announcement that relates to exploration results is based on information reviewed by Dr Lawrence Carter MSc PhD MAusIMM who is an Independent Geological Consultant.

West Huntoon lies within a richly mineralised valley system that hosts multiple copper prospects within a 6 km radius, underscoring the broader potential of this emerging copper district. Samples from all holes are being dispatched for laboratory assay, with results expected in the coming weeks.\nFollowing completion of the West Huntoon phase, the drill rig has been mobilised to the high-priority Rhyolite Dome target, a large, previously undrilled, silica-flooded system displaying strong epithermal indicators at the Olympic Gold Project. The six-hole programme now underway is designed to test several shallow anomalies identified by a recent induced polarisation (\"IP\") geophysical survey and is expected to conclude during October.\nBrian Hall, Chairman of Great Western Mining, commented:\n\"Our exploration campaign in the Walker Lane Belt continues to gather real momentum. Completing the West Huntoon programme represents another significant milestone as we systematically test a pipeline of highly prospective targets across our Nevada portfolio. Mobilising immediately to Rhyolite Dome keeps our field operations moving at pace and we are excited by the potential of this previously undrilled system.
