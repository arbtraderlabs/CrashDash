However, the decision by our JV partner FAU to withdraw from all international activities provides the opportunity for Hamak to resume 100% ownership of the highly prospective Nimba gold project, for zero cost, at a time of record gold prices, and it undoubtedly enhances our differentiated gold and bitcoin strategy.\n\"We will now restructure the Nimba project, against a backdrop of a 68% increase in the spot gold price since the creation of the FAU JV last year, whilst also actively pursuing the due diligence on the high priority Akoko gold project in Ghana, which we look forward to providing further updates on in due course.\n\"As a result of the rapid and intendend build-up of our activities, we are also formulating a new board and management team to take the business strategy forward, and will announce these changes in the near future.\"\nNimba Project\nHamak and ASX listed First Au Limited (ASX:FAU) have mutually agreed to terminate the Nimba JV agreement entered into in May 2025, and Hamak will re-acquire 100% of the project with immediate effect, for nil initial payment,. FAU has announced, earlier today, its intention to exclusively focus its efforts on domestic, Western Australia activities and has therefore made the strategic decision to withdraw from all its overseas projects, including the Nimba project in Liberia.\nDuring the initial nine months of the JV, FAU has significantly advanced the understanding of the structural geology of the Nimba project, through geological mapping, sampling and the drilling of eleven holes for 1,570 metres. The first two holes drilled intersected wide zones of gold mineralisation of 29m at 1g/t Au and 8m at 2.6g/t Au*, which supported Hamak's previous best intersection of 20m at 7g/t Au. Subsequent holes targeting certain structural features have however failed to intersect any meaningful mineralsation with low tenure gold returns only. The defined 5km x 1km strong gold in soil anomaly remains to be explained by the limited drilling undertaken to date and further work is required. Detailed geochemical soil sampling is ongoing by Hamak over the area of interest to better define future drill targets.\nDuring the JV, FAU has expended over A$600,000 on the project. In addition, Hamak has received 100m shares in FAU as well as A$250,000 in cash, in return for issuing FAU a 35% interest in the Nimba project. Both Hamak and FAU have agreed that the 35% interest in Nimba will be returned to Hamak in return for a future Net Smelter Royalty of 2%, which Hamak can repurchase at the production stage for US$1 million for each percentage. Hamak has agreed to sell its 100m shares in FAU off market for A$750,000, being a 17% discount to the 15 day VWAP of the FAU share price. Hamak wil receive the full A$750,000 cash receipts when shares are released from escrow on the 26 February 2026.\nHamak is currently in advanced discussions with a potential new joint venture partner to further advance the Nimba project and updates will be announced on this in the near future.\n*refer to announcement dated 8 October 2025\nAkoko Gold Project; Ghana\nAfter a successful site visit to the Akoko project in early January by executive Director Karl Smithson, the due diligence process has progressed well and should conclude in the near future. This includes engagement of an independent legal firm to confirm the validity of the licence tenure. Furthermore, following meetings with a number of drilling companies, Hamak is in the process of appointing an experienced drilling company to undertake a planned 4,250m of reverse circulation drillilng to not only confirm but also enhance the confidence in the geological resource, which is currently declared at in excess of 250,000 ounces gold near surface, and which it is believed is amenable to a potential low-cost low-strip ratio open pit heap leach mining operation.\nPresently a detailed topographical survey is being conducted across the main areas of gold interest and engagements with the local communities and chiefdoms are ongoing, all in advance of the onset of drilling operations should the due diligence be successfully concluded.\nBoard and Management Changes\nDuring January the Company has been actively working towards implementing numerous appointments and changes to its board, advisory board and management team to provide a coherent and effective team to drive the corporate strategy over the coming months and years. These appointments and changes will be announced to the market in the near future.\nFor the purposes of UK MAR, the person responsible for arranging release of this announcement on behalf of Hamak is Karl Smithson, Executive Director.\nFor further information on Hamak you are invited to view the company's website at\nhttps://hamakstrategy.com/\nor please contact:\nHamak Strategy Limited\nKarl Smithson\nk.smithson@hamakstrategy.com\nAlbR Capital Limited (Corporate Broker)\nYellow Jersey PR\nAnnabelle Wills\n+44 (0) 20 7469 0930\n+44 (0) 20 3004 9512\nAbout Hamak Strategy Limited\nHamak Strategy Limited (LSE: HAMA / OTCQB: HASTF) is a UK listed company focussed on gold exploration in Africa and with a strategy of pursuing an appropriate and compliant BTC/ crypto treasury management policy.\nImportant Notice\nThe Company maintains some of its treasury reserves and surplus cash in Bitcoin, a form of cryptocurrency.

(LSE: HAMA / OTCQB: HASTF), a company combining traditional gold exploration in Africa with a Digital Asset Treasury Management strategy, is pleased to announce that it has entered into a Binding Term Sheet (\"Term Sheet\") with UK registered private company, CAA Mining Limited (\"CAA\"), which holds a purchase option with a private Ghanian company, Topago Mining Limited (\"Topago\"), to acquire the highly prospective Akoko gold licence in Ghana (\"Akoko\"). Significant historical work on Akoko led to the definition of an Inferred gold resource of 276,500 ounces, much of which is hosted in surficial and highly weathered oxide material that may be amenable to low-cost open pit mining and heap leach gold recovery.\nHighlights:\n\u00b7\nHistorical work by CAA and others has identified an Inferred gold resource at Akoko of 276,500 ounces of contained gold at a grade of 1.6 grammes per tonne (\"g/t\").\n\u00b7\nInitial due diligence conducted by Hamak, based upon the CAA data room, has returned very positive results, even using a more conservative modelling approach, to define a robust, indicated gold resource of 252,659 ounces of contained gold at an average grade of 0.58g/t.\n\u00b7\nHamak will pay CAA \u00a320,000 for a 120-day exclusivity period to conclude technical and legal due diligence on Akoko.\n\u00b7\nSubject to a successful outcome of the due diligence, Hamak will commit to spend a minimum of \u00a3500,000 on further exploration and confirmatory work at Akoko during 2026 with the objective to define, with enhanced confidence and potentially increase, the gold resource at Akoko, and conduct an economic scoping study for an open pit, heap-leach gold mining operation.\n\u00b7\nSubject to satisfactory confirmatory work, Hamak will have the right to exercise its option any time prior to 14 December 2026 to purchase the Akoko licence via the CAA option with Topago through;\no\nPayment of \u00a350,000 cash to CAA\no\nIssue of \u00a31 million of new Hamak shares to CAA or its nominees\n\u00a7\nSuch issued shares subject to a six-month escrow period\n\u00a7\nShares issued at a 10% premium to the 30-day VWAP prior to the notice of exercise\no\nPayment of US$1.9 million to Topago.\n\u00b7\nCAA will have the right to appoint its CEO and seasoned gold executive Douglas Chikohora to the Board of Hamak once Hamak has exercised its option to purchase Akoko and has issued the shares to CAA.\n\u00b7\nOn completion of the acquisition and on entering commercial production, CAA will be awarded the following Net Smelter Royalty (\"NSR\");\no\n0.5% on gold production up to 250,000 ounces\no\n1.0% on gold production from 250,000 ounces to 1 million ounces, capped\n\u00b7\nHamak will have the first right of refusal to purchase the NSR from CAA.\n\u00b7\nProposed acquisition price of cash and shares equates to US$8 to 10 per ounce of gold.\nExecutive Director Karl Smithson commented:\n\u200b\n\"Hamak has secured the binding rights to acquire a high potential gold project in the heart of one of the most prolific gold areas in West Africa. The current Akoko gold resource of over 250,000 ounces provides a great opportunity for Hamak to quickly assess the economic viability of a low-cost open pit mining operation. Furthermore, based on the historical data and results, we see the potential for a much larger gold resource in the Akoko licence.\n\"The relative acquisition cost of US$8 to 10 per ounce of gold, we believe, provides shareholders with a significant value accretive transaction opportunity, particularly considering the current strong and positive outlook for the gold price.\n\"We look forward to providing further updates as the final stages of due diligence are completed in the first quarter of 2026.\"\nAkoko Project Location and Regional Geology\nThe Akoko Project is situated 25km south of Tarkwa in the Ashanti greenstone belt of Ghana (Figure 1) centred approximately 45km west northwest of Takoradi, Ghana's second port and primary locus for the import and fabrication of mining equipment and approximately a three-hour drive from the capital Accra. It lies close to the primary mining centres at Tarkwa and Obuasi where major equipment suppliers and internationally accredited laboratory services are readily available.\nThe Ashanti belt of Ghana is the most significant area of gold mineralization in the Paleoproterozoic terrane of West Africa. The area, located in southwest Ghana, is covered by lithologies of the volcanic-sedimentary Birimian Supergroup and the overlying clastic sedimentary Tarkwaian Group.\nBot",

The Yorkville Group and ATM deal stood out as a win for both the Company and our investors as it provides Hamak with funding flexibility for us to pursue our strategy on a managed basis.\n\"We look forward to a long partnership with the Yorkville Group and believe that it can further assist us in the US and with the activation of our OTC strategy.\n\"We will also announce further material developments in regard to our Treasury policy shortly, where the market will be able to see our commitment to our dual gold/bitcoin strategy to grow shareholder value.\"\nConvertible Loan Note (\"CLN\")\nThe principal amount of the CLN is \u00a35 million which will be drawn down, net of fees.\nThe CLN is conditional inter alia on certain conditions precedent (\"Conditions Precedent\"), which shall be satisfied within 30 days, including:\n(i) the passing of a shareholder resolution (\"Waiver Resolution\") to be proposed at a general meeting of the Company to be held on 3 November 2025 at 11.30 (\"General Meeting\") to waive all and any pre-emption rights in respect of the issue of (a) shares to cover repayment should YA exercise its conversion rights and (b) any shares to be issued pursuant to the ATM;\n(ii) the establishment of certain security arrangements to support the CLN; and\n(iii) the execution of the ATM.\nThe CLN can be converted into new Hamak shares by YA at a 20% premium to the lower of:\n(i) the Closing Price of the Shares at the end of the trading day immediately prior to the Completion Date (being the date on which all conditions precedent to drawdown of the funds are met); and\n(ii) the average of the VWAP over the five trading days ended on the trading day immediately preceding the Completion Date.\nRepayment of the loan will be amortised at a rate of \u00a3500,000 (plus any accrued interest) per month over one year after the first sixty days from draw down, unless YA has previously exercised its conversion rights. The loan attracts a modest 5% coupon which will begin to accrue from the first drawdown after Completion Date. The Company has the option to repay the CLN early, and proceeds received from the ATM will first be used to repay the CLN.\nAt the Market (\"ATM\") Facility\nThe Company is also pleased to announce that it has provisionally agreed to enter into an ATM facility of up to \u00a330 million with its broker AlbR Capital. The purpose of the ATM is to provide the Company with a controlled mechanism to issue new shares in the future to raise capital to fund the progression of the Company's ambitious gold and bitcoin treasury management growth plans and to repay the amortisation of the YA CLN.\nThe Company will be fully in control of the use of the ATM including setting a variable floor price and volume of shares to be traded, as well as when to trade shares. This ensures an orderly market of its shares to meet future demand and ensures the maintenance of an orderly market in the Company's shares at all times.\nEntering into the full formal ATM agreement is expected to be achieved prior to the General Meeting, at which time a further announcement will be made. As with the CLN issuance, the use of the ATM facility is, de-facto, subject to shareholder approval to issue new shares.\nGeneral Meeting\nThe CLN has been signed with drawdown of the CLN and issuance of new shares via the ATM being conditional on (inter alia) the Waiver Resolution being passed at the General Meeting.\nA notice of meeting circular and voting proxy forms are expected to be posted to shareholders on or about 17th October 2025 and the General Meeting is scheduled for 3 November at 11am at the offices of AlbR Capital at 80 Cheapside, London, EC2V 6EE.\nThe Company advises that it has secured Irrevocable Undertakings to vote in favour of the Waiver Resolution, primarily from its Board and management as wel",

(LSE: HAMA / OTCQB: HASTF), a company combining traditional gold exploration in Africa with a Digital Asset Treasury Management strategy, is pleased to announce the first drilling results from its joint venture (JV) with First Au Limited (ASX: FAU) on its 65% owned Nimba gold project.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nHole FADD25-001 intersected a wide mineralised zone of\n29m at 0.97g/t Au\nfrom 49m to 78m\no\nIncluding\n23m at 1.15g/t Au\nfrom 49m to 72m depth, with individual high-grade intersections of 4.1g/t Au, 3.1g/t Au, 2.7g/t Au, 2.3g/t Au and 2.0g/t Au\n\u00b7\nA deeper intersection also yielded\n8m at 2.55g/t Au\nfrom 130m to 138m\no\nIncluding\n2m at 8.37g/t Au\nwith individual intersections of 7.7g/t Au and 9.1g/t Au\n\u00b7\nThese intersections confirm the continuity of mineralisation at depth from the first Hamak drilling that intersected\n20m at 7g/t\nAu closer to surface\n\u00b7\nThe gold mineralisation remains open at depth\n\u00b7\nAssay results for the next two holes, FADD-002 and 003, are expected in the near future\nNick Thurlow, Executive Chairman of Hamak Strategy, commented\n:\n\"We are greatly encouraged by the wide intersections of gold mineralisation returned from the first hole assay results, which confirm the depth extensions to the high-grade discovery made by Hamak. We look forward to advancing the drilling programme and reporting further assay results, in partnership with and funded by our JV partners, First Au Limited.\"\nNimba Drilling and Results Update\nHamak's joint venture partner, FAU (35% project owner), is fully funding exploration work at Nimba to include an initial 3,000m drilling programme at the Ziatoyah gold discovery. Drilling is currently ongoing with five holes for 948.90 metres having been completed to date. The objective of the drilling to confirm the original high-grade drilling results of Hamak has been successfully achieved, and further drilling is ongoing to determine the continuity and structural control of the gold mineralisation.\nThe first hole drilled, FADD25-001, was oriented with the objective to prove the depth extensions of Hamak's near-surface and high-grade intersection of 20m at 7g/t Au (hole NZ22-001). The assay results confirm a wider intersection of 29m at 0.97g/t Au, which included a higher grade zone of 23m at 1.15g/t Au. A second deeper zone returning 8m at 2.55g/t Au was also intersected, confirming the widening of a narrower zone intersected by Hamak's drilling of 2m at 1.2g/t Au (Tables 1 and 2 and Figure 1).\nTable 1: Drill Hole Information for Current Programme and Hamak Strategy's Discovery Hole\nHole\nEasting\nNorthing\nElevation (m)\nAzimuth (degrees)\nInclination (degrees)\nEnd of Hole (m)\nFADD-001\n562032\n744094\n243.26\n293\n-50\n240.0\nFADD-002\n562074\n744139\n241.50\n293\n-60\n280.5\nFADD-003\n562069\n744238\n240.60\n293\n-62\n264.5\nFADD-004\n562129\n744238\n241.50\n293\n-60\n99.7\nFADD-005\n561803\n744897\n246.17\n305\n-55\n102.20\nNZ22-001\n562015\n744095\n244.30\n292\n-45\n117.7\nTable 2: Significant Downhole Intercepts of FADD25-001 and NZ22-001\nHole\nFrom (m)\nTo (m)\nDownhole Length (m)\nGrade (g/t AU)\nFADD-001\n49\n78\n29\n0.97\nincluding\n49\n72\n23\n1.15\n130\n137\n8\n2.55\nincluding\n130\n135\n5\n3.91\nand including\n131\n133\n2\n8.73\nNZ22-001\n29\n49\n20\n6.98\nincluding\n35\n40\n5\n21.73\n85\n87\n2\n1.19\nFigure 1: Section of Drilling and Mineralisation at Holes NZ22-001 and FADD25-001\nA number of high-grade intersections were made in the wider mineralised zone of hole FADD-001 (Table 2) and repeat assays show variability in some results, which is indicative of coarse native gold. Visible gold was observed in both FAU's hole FADD25-001 (Figure 2) and Hamak's hole NZ22-001.\nFigure 2:\nVisible gold (circled in red) captured at 51m (a), 60.95m (b) and 132m (c) from hole FADD25-001\nScreen fire assays are currently underway to verify the potential presence of larger gold particles that may have been under-represented in the initial crushed pulp assays.\nDrill holes FADD-002 (280.50m) and FADD-003 (264.50m) have been completed and assays are pending. Drill hole FADD-004 was abandoned at 99.7m due to ground conditions.\nHoles FADD-005 (100.20m) and FADD-006 (in progress) and 007 are located some 500m to the north of the Ziatoyah discovery and are testing a new area where artisanal gold mining coincides with strong geochemical soil anomalies and a surface rock sample assay that returned a grade of 6.13g/t Au (Figure 3).\nFurther updates on progress will be announced in due course.\nFigure 3: Drill Hole Location and Geochemical Gold in Soil Anomalies\n",

Following a satisfactory due diligence exercise, the first stage payment of A$250,000 cash and 100 million FAU shares have been received by the Company in return for a 35% interest in the Nimba project. A second stage payment of 200 million FAU shares will be made to Hamak Gold within 9 months of the Stage-1 payment and in return for a further 35% interest in Nimba. At FAU's option a third stage payment of A$600,000 in FAU shares at a market determined VWAP may be made to fully acquire the Nimba project. Thereafter certain Nimba resource-based milestone payments may be made to Hamak Gold in FAU shares totalling A$2 million.\nNimba Exploration\nA detailed structural geological mapping exercise was completed across priority areas of the strong 5km x 1km gold in soil anomaly and in proximity to the high-grade Ziatoyah gold discovery as a pre-curser to a FAU funded 3,000m drilling programme during 2025. This drilling is aimed at further delineating the gold mineralisation identified by Hamak Gold at the Ziatoyah discovery.\nTwo drill rigs were mobilised to Liberia by FAU and cleared through customs. A 3,000m drilling commenced at the Ziatoyah prospect shortly after the post period to test further mineralised extensions to the significant 20m at 7g/t discovery hole.

This hybrid strategy is intended to deliver low correlation to conventional equity market cycles while offering potential upside from long-term structural trends.\nThe initiative forms part of a more comprehensive treasury framework designed to incorporate strategic reserves, liquidity tools, and non-dilutive value protection mechanisms for shareholders.\nNick Thurlow, Executive Chairman of Hamak Gold Ltd, commented:\n\"We are pleased to be delivering on the initial plan we announced to the market just a few weeks ago. We're excited to partner with Archax, the premier UK-regulated crypto trading and custody firm. We will also continue to strengthen our team through making further high-level appointments that will bring the necessary expertise for us to execute our corporate strategy and further enhance shareholder value.\"\nGraham Rodford, CEO and Co-Founder of Archax, commented:\n\"We are pleased to be supporting Hamak Gold in their new strategic direction and digital asset activities.\nBitcoin's fixed supply of 21 million units is often cited as a distinguishing feature by market participants seeking alternatives to inflation-prone fiat currencies-complementing gold's long-standing role as a store of value.

In return, Hamak Gold will issue FAU a 35% interest in its subsidiary company 79 Resources Inc that holds the Nimba licence.\nNick Thurlow, Chairman of Hamak Gold Ltd, commented:\n\"The FAU announcement, and the very marked increase in FAU's share price over recent weeks, means that Hamak is now due to receive double the value in new FAU shares it was initially due.

Firstly, maximising our existing gold exploration and development opportunities and secondly, seizing the transformative opportunity as a Main Market listed company to lead the UK in bitcoin treasury management.\nWe aim to provide institutional and professional investors with structured, professionally managed exposure to both gold and the wider digital asset space. This strategy will be underpinned by a substantial Bitcoin asset base, offering transparency, institutional-grade security, and governance oversight through our listing on the London Stock Exchange's Main Market.\nOur Main Market listing subjects us to the UK's highest standards of disclosure and market conduct, further differentiating the Company from its peers listed on other UK exchanges.\"\nPlacing and Subscription\nThe Company has raised gross proceeds of \u00a32,467,000 at a price of\n\u00a3\n0.008 per share through the issue of 308,375,000 new shares to new investors, introduced by the new Directors and Peterhouse Capital.

Inter-alia, under the Agreement, FAU will be responsible for funding further ongoing exploration work and drilling at Nimba. As consideration First Au has agreed to issue new FAU shares to Hamak Gold through a progressive earn-in schedule.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nFAU to fully fund the exploration programme at Nimba, including a minimum of 2,500 meters of diamond drilling and assays during 2025 to further define the extent of the high-grade gold discovery at Ziatoyah\n\u00b7\nTwo new diamond drill rigs, including two year's worth of critical spares, have been shipped and received in Liberia to undertake the drilling programme for 2025, and beyond\n\u00b7\nFAU will progressively increase its interest in the Nimba project through funding the exploration as well as issuing shares in FAU to Hamak Gold\n\u00b7\nSubject to resource development milestones being achieved, further FAU shares will be awarded to Hamak Gold\nKarl Smithson, Executive Director of Hamak Gold commented:\n\"We are delighted to form this partnership with First Au Limited so we can rapidly advance the development of the Nimba exploration programme through efficient, cost-effective owner operated drilling.\n\"FAU has an excellent technical team that can lead the programme with the objective of further defining the extent of the high-grade Ziatoyah gold discovery with the ultimate aim of progressing towards a maiden resource declaration. The exploration expenditure will be fully funded by FAU, whilst Hamak Gold will simultaneously accrue value through the progressive issue of FAU shares over the next 12 months. The Company will also have possible future value accretion events in the event of a resource declaration at Nimba.\n\"The Board of Hamak Gold believes that, considering the persistently poor capital markets for small-cap resource companies, this deal with FAU represents value for shareholders both in the immediate and longer term.\n\"We also believe that this Agreement will be beneficial to Liberia, which actively seeks foreign direct investment, particularly in the resources sector, to bring to account its potential mineral wealth for the benefit of the country. Indeed Hamak Gold is a majority Liberian-owned business led by major shareholder and Chairman Amara Kamara, who is also the President of the Chamber of Mines of Liberia, and is instrumental in attracting investment in the wider resources sector in Liberia.\n\"As a Company, Hamak Gold will continue to seek additional projects and corporate strategies in the metals and resources space that we believe can provide further value opportunities.\"\nFigure 1: Nimba Exploration Licence Location\nFirst Au Limited and Hamak Gold Limited Joint Venture Partnership\nHamak Gold and First Au Limited have entered into a binding terms sheet dated 15 May 2025. The terms give the right for FAU to progressively earn up to a 70% interest in 79 Resources Inc, the 100% owned subsidiary of Hamak Gold which directly holds the Nimba licence, through funding exploration work at Nimba as well as issuing up to \u00a3627,473 (A$1.3 million) of FAU shares (or combination of cash/shares) to Hamak Gold Limited over the next nine months. FAU will then have the option to further increase its interest to full ownership in the project should results justify, in return for continued project expenditure and the issue of a further \u00a3289,603 (A$600,000) shares in FAU, being a possible total consideration of \u00a3917,077 (A$1.9 million). All shares issued by FAU will be subject to a six-month voluntary escrow period from time of issue. Furthermore, subject to resource milestones being achieved, FAU will issue up to \u00a3965,344 (A$2 million) shares in FAU to Hamak Gold, in two equal tranches of A$1 million each. The first tranche will be issued when a\ncompliant indicated mineral resource estimate of at least 750,000 ounces Au at a grade of >1.1 g/t Au, is declared. The second tranche will be issued when the compliant indicated mineral resource estimate is declared at 1.5 million ounces Au at a grade of >1.1g/t Au, within five years of the date of issue. Figures stated are converted at a current exchange rate of\n\u00a31 to A$2.07.\nCompletion of the agreement remains subject to a 45 day final due diligence period and the receipt of the fully executed Nimba licence doc",

We have elected to follow a systematic exploration programme of detailed mapping and sampling to help guide the selection of priority drill targets to further define and delineate extensions to the high-grade surface and drill intersections we have made at Ziatoyah. Capital markets remain very challenging for the junior mining sector and the Company therefore continues to evaluate opportunities that can generate shareholder value.\"\nFor further information you are invited to view the company's website at\nwww.hamakgold.com\nor please contact:\nHamak Gold Limited\nAmara Kamara\nKarl Smithson\n+231 (0) 77 005 0005\n+44 (0) 77 837 07971\nPeterhouse Capital Limited (Corporate Broker)\nYellow Jersey PR\nAnnabelle Wills\n+44 (0) 20 7469 0930\n+44 (0) 20 3004 9512\nAbout Hamak Gold Limited\nHamak Gold Limited (LSE: HAMA) is a UK listed company focussed on gold exploration of a portfolio of licences in highly prospective areas of Liberia, where significant drilling results have identified a new high-grade gold discovery with the discovery hole returning 20m @ 7g/t Au near surface in its Nimba licence on the border with Ivory Coast which is located in proximity to the commercial Ity Gold Mine.\nINTERIM MANAGEMENT REPORT\nOperating Review\nThe Company's activities during the period continued to focus on its highly prospective Nimba Licence and in particular the high-grade Ziatoyah gold discovery. During the reporting period the Company undertook further detailed mapping together, trenching and rock chip sampling to better understand the geology of the prospect as well as the extent of the mineralisation indicated by the 5.7km x 1km NE trending gold-in-soil anomaly.\nLicence Holdings\nHamak Gold holds two exploration licences, covering a combined area of 1,115.2 square kilometres (\"km\"), known as Nimba and Gozohn. Bedrock gold discoveries, associated with extensive gold in soil anomalies, have been made at both licences. Exploration efforts during the reporting period focussed on the Nimba licence Ziatoyah gold discovery.\nNimba Licence\nThe Nimba Licence (MEL7001518) covers an area of 985.60 square kilometres and is located approximately 120km to the north-east of the Gozohn licence and some 25km west of Endeavour Mining's 5-million-ounce (\"Moz\") Ity Gold Mine in neighbouring Cote D'Ivoire.\nSince the Company's IPO in March 2022, detailed soil, trench/channel and rock chip sampling have been completed with positive results. In late 2022, this culminated in the discovery of an outcropping (at surface) gold mineralized metadolerite unit at a site called Ziatoyah, which was subsequently drilled and returned a best result of 20m at 7g/t Au near surface and under the mineralized outcrop.\nThe associated gold in soil anomaly extends over a 5.7km by 1km northeast trending area, where outcrop is limited. Streams that dissect the anomaly are exploited by artisanal gold miners, suggesting that the extent of the anomaly may be related to an extensive hard rock gold deposit.\nIn 2023, an Induced Polarisation (IP) geophysical survey was completed over a restricted area of the Ziatoyah area in attempt to locate sub-surface sulphide mineralization that could be associated with gold. This was followed by a limited drill programme of 1,000m to test the geophysical anomalies generated, but with limited success. The IP tended not to efficiently penetrate the deep weathering profile and detect the sulphide mineralization at depth.\nTherefor",

The Company is not authorised or regulated by The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Bitcoin investments are generally not subject to regulation by the FCA or otherwise in the United Kingdom. Neither the Company nor investors in the Company's shares are protected by the UK's Financial Ombudsman Service or the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.\nHowever the FCA considers Bitcoin investments to be high-risk. The value of Bitcoin can go up as well as down, leading to fluctuations in the value of the Company's Bitcoin holdings, and the Company may not be able to realise its Bitcoin holdings for the same amount it paid to acquire them, or even for the value the Company currently attributes to its Bitcoin positions.\nThe Company's Board of Directors have identified the following risks in relation to the holding of Bitcoin, which are not exhaustive:\n\u2022 The value of Bitcoin can be highly volatile, with its value falling as quickly as it rises. Investors in Bitcoin must be prepared to lose all money invested.\n\u2022 The Bitcoin market is largely unregulated. There is a risk of losing money due to factors such as cyber-attacks, financial crime, and counterparty failure.\n\u2022 The Company may not be able to sell its Bitcoin at will. The ability to sell Bitcoin depends on various factors, including the supply and demand in the market at the relevant time. Operational failings such as technology outages, cyber-attacks, and comingling of funds could cause unwanted delays.\n\u2022 Cryptoassets carry a perception of fraud, money laundering, and financial crime.\nAn investment in the Company is not an investment in Bitcoin itself, but prospective investors in the Company are encouraged to conduct their own research before investing and should be aware that they will have indirect exposure to the high-risk nature of cryptoassets, including their volatility, and could therefore sustain large or total losses of their investment.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

I know the Sunday Roast are not the most well regarded in the PR space however they do have contacts and are about to have an interview with the company in the near term, the commentator said he met the founder of Hamak last week and suggests there are some exciting things ahead. I have noticed that market size in stock to the buy side has reduced over recent sessions, this suggests underlying demand for the shares, would not be surprised to see a formidable re-rate from current levels shortly. Link to the podcast mention below, Hamak is covered at 1 hour 34 minutes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NASsfp1Dpk&t=4886s",

The communication has much room for improvement. What's happened to the FAU drilling program for example? To my knowledge the last update from FAU was the 7th October which stated they were around 1100m into a 3000m drill program but nothing since. Bizarre and a little worrying. Fingers crossed that new appointments, updates and even the long awaited strategy are released very soon. GLA",

I know the Sunday Roast are not the most well regarded in the PR space however they do have contacts and are about to have an interview with the company in the near term, the commentator said he met the founder of Hamak last week and suggests there are some exciting things ahead. I have noticed that market size in stock to the buy side has reduced over recent sessions, this suggests underlying demand for the shares, would not be surprised to see a formidable re-rate from current levels shortly. Link to the podcast mention below, Hamak is covered at 1 hour 34 minutes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NASsfp1Dpk&t=4886s",

The communication has much room for improvement. What's happened to the FAU drilling program for example? To my knowledge the last update from FAU was the 7th October which stated they were around 1100m into a 3000m drill program but nothing since. Bizarre and a little worrying. Fingers crossed that new appointments, updates and even the long awaited strategy are released very soon. GLA",

The communication has much room for improvement. What's happened to the FAU drilling program for example? To my knowledge the last update from FAU was the 7th October which stated they were around 1100m into a 3000m drill program but nothing since. Bizarre and a little worrying. Fingers crossed that new appointments, updates and even the long awaited strategy are released very soon. GLA",

I know the Sunday Roast are not the most well regarded in the PR space however they do have contacts and are about to have an interview with the company in the near term, the commentator said he met the founder of Hamak last week and suggests there are some exciting things ahead. I have noticed that market size in stock to the buy side has reduced over recent sessions, this suggests underlying demand for the shares, would not be surprised to see a formidable re-rate from current levels shortly.

The communication has much room for improvement. What's happened to the FAU drilling program for example? To my knowledge the last update from FAU was the 7th October which stated they were around 1100m into a 3000m drill program but nothing since. Bizarre and a little worrying. Fingers crossed that new appointments, updates and even the long awaited strategy are released very soon. GLA",

I know the Sunday Roast are not the most well regarded in the PR space however they do have contacts and are about to have an interview with the company in the near term, the commentator said he met the founder of Hamak last week and suggests there are some exciting things ahead. I have noticed that market size in stock to the buy side has reduced over recent sessions, this suggests underlying demand for the shares, would not be surprised to see a formidable re-rate from current levels shortly.

To my knowledge the last update from FAU was the 7th October which stated they were around 1100m into a 3000m drill program but nothing since. Bizarre and a little worrying. Fingers crossed that new appointments, updates and even the long awaited strategy are released very soon. GLA",

I have noticed that market size in stock to the buy side has reduced over recent sessions, this suggests underlying demand for the shares, would not be surprised to see a formidable re-rate from current levels shortly. Link to the podcast mention below, Hamak is covered at 1 hour 34 minutes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NASsfp1Dpk&t=4886s",

To my knowledge the last update from FAU was the 7th October which stated they were around 1100m into a 3000m drill program but nothing since. Bizarre and a little worrying.

The Bitcoin was purchased via its FCA-regulated digital asset exchange broker and custodian, Archax.

The Company is not authorised or regulated by The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Bitcoin investments are generally not subject to regulation by the FCA or otherwise in the United Kingdom. Neither the Company nor investors in the Company's shares are protected by the UK's Financial Ombudsman Service or the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.\nHowever the FCA considers Bitcoin investments to be high-risk. The value of Bitcoin can go up as well as down, leading to fluctuations in the value of the Company's Bitcoin holdings, and the Company may not be able to realise its Bitcoin holdings for the same amount it paid to acquire them, or even for the value the Company currently attributes to its Bitcoin positions.\nThe Company's Board of Directors have identified the following risks in relation to the holding of Bitcoin, which are not exhaustive:\n\u2022 The value of Bitcoin can be highly volatile, with its value falling as quickly as it rises. Investors in Bitcoin must be prepared to lose all money invested.\n\u2022 The Bitcoin market is largely unregulated. There is a risk of losing money due to factors such as cyber-attacks, financial crime, and counterparty failure.\n\u2022 The Company may not be able to sell its Bitcoin at will. The ability to sell Bitcoin depends on various factors, including the supply and demand in the market at the relevant time. Operational failings such as technology outages, cyber-attacks, and comingling of funds could cause unwanted delays.\n\u2022 Cryptoassets carry a perception of fraud, money laundering, and financial crime.\nAn investment in the Company is not an investment in Bitcoin itself, but prospective investors in the Company are encouraged to conduct their own research before investing and should be aware that they will have indirect exposure to the high-risk nature of cryptoassets, including their volatility, and could therefore sustain large or total losses of their investment.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

To my knowledge the last update from FAU was the 7th October which stated they were around 1100m into a 3000m drill program but nothing since. Bizarre and a little worrying. Fingers crossed that new appointments, updates and even the long awaited strategy are released very soon. GLA",

I have noticed that market size in stock to the buy side has reduced over recent sessions, this suggests underlying demand for the shares, would not be surprised to see a formidable re-rate from current levels shortly.

The communication has much room for improvement. What's happened to the FAU drilling program for example? To my knowledge the last update from FAU was the 7th October which stated they were around 1100m into a 3000m drill program but nothing since. Bizarre and a little worrying. Fingers crossed that new appointments, updates and even the long awaited strategy are released very soon. GLA",

I know the Sunday Roast are not the most well regarded in the PR space however they do have contacts and are about to have an interview with the company in the near term, the commentator said he met the founder of Hamak last week and suggests there are some exciting things ahead. I have noticed that market size in stock to the buy side has reduced over recent sessions, this suggests underlying demand for the shares, would not be surprised to see a formidable re-rate from current levels shortly.

However, the decision by our JV partner FAU to withdraw from all international activities provides the opportunity for Hamak to resume 100% ownership of the highly prospective Nimba gold project, for zero cost, at a time of record gold prices, and it undoubtedly enhances our differentiated gold and bitcoin strategy.\n\"We will now restructure the Nimba project, against a backdrop of a 68% increase in the spot gold price since the creation of the FAU JV last year, whilst also actively pursuing the due diligence on the high priority Akoko gold project in Ghana, which we look forward to providing further updates on in due course.\n\"As a result of the rapid and intendend build-up of our activities, we are also formulating a new board and management team to take the business strategy forward, and will announce these changes in the near future.\"\nNimba Project\nHamak and ASX listed First Au Limited (ASX:FAU) have mutually agreed to terminate the Nimba JV agreement entered into in May 2025, and Hamak will re-acquire 100% of the project with immediate effect, for nil initial payment,. FAU has announced, earlier today, its intention to exclusively focus its efforts on domestic, Western Australia activities and has therefore made the strategic decision to withdraw from all its overseas projects, including the Nimba project in Liberia.\nDuring the initial nine months of the JV, FAU has significantly advanced the understanding of the structural geology of the Nimba project, through geological mapping, sampling and the drilling of eleven holes for 1,570 metres. The first two holes drilled intersected wide zones of gold mineralisation of 29m at 1g/t Au and 8m at 2.6g/t Au*, which supported Hamak's previous best intersection of 20m at 7g/t Au. Subsequent holes targeting certain structural features have however failed to intersect any meaningful mineralsation with low tenure gold returns only. The defined 5km x 1km strong gold in soil anomaly remains to be explained by the limited drilling undertaken to date and further work is required. Detailed geochemical soil sampling is ongoing by Hamak over the area of interest to better define future drill targets.\nDuring the JV, FAU has expended over A$600,000 on the project. In addition, Hamak has received 100m shares in FAU as well as A$250,000 in cash, in return for issuing FAU a 35% interest in the Nimba project. Both Hamak and FAU have agreed that the 35% interest in Nimba will be returned to Hamak in return for a future Net Smelter Royalty of 2%, which Hamak can repurchase at the production stage for US$1 million for each percentage. Hamak has agreed to sell its 100m shares in FAU off market for A$750,000, being a 17% discount to the 15 day VWAP of the FAU share price. Hamak wil receive the full A$750,000 cash receipts when shares are released from escrow on the 26 February 2026.\nHamak is currently in advanced discussions with a potential new joint venture partner to further advance the Nimba project and updates will be announced on this in the near future.\n*refer to announcement dated 8 October 2025\nAkoko Gold Project; Ghana\nAfter a successful site visit to the Akoko project in early January by executive Director Karl Smithson, the due diligence process has progressed well and should conclude in the near future. This includes engagement of an independent legal firm to confirm the validity of the licence tenure. Furthermore, following meetings with a number of drilling companies, Hamak is in the process of appointing an experienced drilling company to undertake a planned 4,250m o",

Even if it's just a 'The drilling is now complete and we await assay results' etc I really don't believe that they know 'nothing more' and have no further updates to give. I sure hope something big is brewing as things currently don't feel right. GLA",

To my knowledge the last update from FAU was the 7th October which stated they were around 1100m into a 3000m drill program but nothing since. Bizarre and a little worrying. Fingers crossed that new appointments, updates and even the long awaited strategy are released very soon. GLA",

I have noticed that market size in stock to the buy side has reduced over recent sessions, this suggests underlying demand for the shares, would not be surprised to see a formidable re-rate from current levels shortly.

For every cycle, trend and fad, some closely followed execs tend to find an angle for the small cap investment audience. So it is then, that as gold smashes through $5,000 an ounce and Bitcoin remains 'off the boil', that David Lenigas presents an opportunity and a hedge for shareholders in his vehicle the London BTC Company. London BTC #BTC on Friday announced it had picked up options over gold tenements in Western Australia, giving it a chance to acquire acreage hosting the historic Chance gold mine. At the same time, the small cap firm (valued at around \u00a39.5 million currently) said it would potentially also set up a special purpose vehicle in the US to acquire gold resource assets there too, alongside possible expansions to bitcoin mining operations. 'We like Bitcoin and we like gold, and by linking the two we feel we could create a very exciting platform for growth,' Lenigas explained cogently via RNS. With an eye to future dealmaking, Lenigas added: 'Great gold tenements can be run up the value curve and either developed or sold, and these funds could be used to make us bigger in Bitcoin much quicker.' Evidently, investors following the shares may not have been massively wowed, partly because a move like this had been flagged in November. You can\u2019t make it up . Well you can obviously \ud83d\ude48",

Extract RNS: During the initial nine months of the JV, FAU has significantly advanced the understanding of the structural geology of the Nimba project, through geological mapping, sampling and the drilling of eleven holes for 1,570 metres. The first two holes drilled intersected wide zones of gold mineralisation of 29m at 1g/t Au and 8m at 2.6g/t Au*, which supported Hamak's previous best intersection of 20m at 7g/t Au. Subsequent holes targeting certain structural features have however failed to intersect any meaningful mineralsation with low tenure gold returns only. The defined 5km x 1km strong gold in soil anomaly remains to be explained by the limited drilling undertaken to date and further work is required.  Detailed geochemical soil sampling is ongoing by Hamak over the area of interest to better define future drill targets. During the JV, FAU has expended over A$600,000 on the project. In addition, Hamak has received 100m shares in FAU as well as A$250,000 in cash, in return for issuing FAU a 35% interest in the Nimba project. Both Hamak and FAU have agreed that the 35% interest in Nimba will be returned to Hamak in return for a future Net Smelter Royalty of 2%, which Hamak can repurchase at the production stage for US$1 million for each percentage. Hamak has agreed to sell its 100m shares in FAU off market for A$750,000, being a 17% discount to the 15 day VWAP of the FAU share price. Hamak wil receive the full A$750,000 cash receipts when shares are released from escrow on the 26 February 2026.",

The first two holes drilled intersected wide zones of gold mineralisation of 29m at 1g/t Au and 8m at 2.6g/t Au*, which supported Hamak's previous best intersection of 20m at 7g/t Au. Subsequent holes targeting certain structural features have however failed to intersect any meaningful mineralsation with low tenure gold returns only. The defined 5km x 1km strong gold in soil anomaly remains to be explained by the limited drilling undertaken to date and further work is required.  Detailed geochemical soil sampling is ongoing by Hamak over the area of interest to better define future drill targets. During the JV, FAU has expended over A$600,000 on the project. In addition, Hamak has received 100m shares in FAU as well as A$250,000 in cash, in return for issuing FAU a 35% interest in the Nimba project. Both Hamak and FAU have agreed that the 35% interest in Nimba will be returned to Hamak in return for a future Net Smelter Royalty of 2%, which Hamak can repurchase at the production stage for US$1 million for each percentage. Hamak has agreed to sell its 100m shares in FAU off market for A$750,000, being a 17% discount to the 15 day VWAP of the FAU share price. Hamak wil receive the full A$750,000 cash receipts when shares are released from escrow on the 26 February 2026.",

The communication has much room for improvement. What's happened to the FAU drilling program for example? To my knowledge the last update from FAU was the 7th October which stated they were around 1100m into a 3000m drill program but nothing since. Bizarre and a little worrying. Fingers crossed that new appointments, updates and even the long awaited strategy are released very soon. GLA",

I know the Sunday Roast are not the most well regarded in the PR space however they do have contacts and are about to have an interview with the company in the near term, the commentator said he met the founder of Hamak last week and suggests there are some exciting things ahead. I have noticed that market size in stock to the buy side has reduced over recent sessions, this suggests underlying demand for the shares, would not be surprised to see a formidable re-rate from current levels shortly.

          "content": "SMALL CAP MOVERS: London BTC launches gold hedging strategy There are few storytellers and yarn spinners as deft as the small cap market's perennial dealmakers. For every cycle, trend and fad, some closely followed execs tend to find an angle for the small cap investment audience. So it is then, that as gold smashes through $5,000 an ounce and Bitcoin remains 'off the boil', that David Lenigas presents an opportunity and a hedge for shareholders in his vehicle the London BTC Company. London BTC #BTC on Friday announced it had picked up options over gold tenements in Western Australia, giving it a chance to acquire acreage hosting the historic Chance gold mine. At the same time, the small cap firm (valued at around \u00a39.5 million currently) said it would potentially also set up a special purpose vehicle in the US to acquire gold resource assets there too, alongside possible expansions to bitcoin mining operations. 'We like Bitcoin and we like gold, and by linking the two we feel we could create a very exciting platform for growth,' Lenigas explained cogently via RNS. With an eye to future dealmaking, Lenigas added: 'Great gold tenements can be run up the value curve and either developed or sold, and these funds could be used to make us bigger in Bitcoin much quicker.' Evidently, investors following the shares may not have been massively wowed, partly because a move like this had been flagged in November. You can\u2019t make it up . Well you can obviously \ud83d\ude48",

Extract RNS: During the initial nine months of the JV, FAU has significantly advanced the understanding of the structural geology of the Nimba project, through geological mapping, sampling and the drilling of eleven holes for 1,570 metres. The first two holes drilled intersected wide zones of gold mineralisation of 29m at 1g/t Au and 8m at 2.6g/t Au*, which supported Hamak's previous best intersection of 20m at 7g/t Au. Subsequent holes targeting certain structural features have however failed to intersect any meaningful mineralsation with low tenure gold returns only. The defined 5km x 1km strong gold in soil anomaly remains to be explained by the limited drilling undertaken to date and further work is required.  Detailed geochemical soil sampling is ongoing by Hamak over the area of interest to better define future drill targets. During the JV, FAU has expended over A$600,000 on the project. In addition, Hamak has received 100m shares in FAU as well as A$250,000 in cash, in return for issuing FAU a 35% interest in the Nimba project. Both Hamak and FAU have agreed that the 35% interest in Nimba will be returned to Hamak in return for a future Net Smelter Royalty of 2%, which Hamak can repurchase at the production stage for US$1 million for each percentage. Hamak has agreed to sell its 100m shares in FAU off market for A$750,000, being a 17% discount to the 15 day VWAP of the FAU share price. Hamak wil receive the full A$750,000 cash receipts when shares are released from escrow on the 26 February 2026.",

Extract RNS: During the initial nine months of the JV, FAU has significantly advanced the understanding of the structural geology of the Nimba project, through geological mapping, sampling and the drilling of eleven holes for 1,570 metres. The first two holes drilled intersected wide zones of gold mineralisation of 29m at 1g/t Au and 8m at 2.6g/t Au*, which supported Hamak's previous best intersection of 20m at 7g/t Au. Subsequent holes targeting certain structural features have however failed to intersect any meaningful mineralsation with low tenure gold returns only. The defined 5km x 1km strong gold in soil anomaly remains to be explained by the limited drilling undertaken to date and further work is required.  Detailed geochemical soil sampling is ongoing by Hamak over the area of interest to better define future drill targets. During the JV, FAU has expended over A$600,000 on the project. In addition, Hamak has received 100m shares in FAU as well as A$250,000 in cash, in return for issuing FAU a 35% interest in the Nimba project. Both Hamak and FAU have agreed that the 35% interest in Nimba will be returned to Hamak in return for a future Net Smelter Royalty of 2%, which Hamak can repurchase at the production stage for US$1 million for each percentage. Hamak has agreed to sell its 100m shares in FAU off market for A$750,000, being a 17% discount to the 15 day VWAP of the FAU share price. Hamak wil receive the full A$750,000 cash receipts when shares are released from escrow on the 26 February 2026.",

To my knowledge the last update from FAU was the 7th October which stated they were around 1100m into a 3000m drill program but nothing since. Bizarre and a little worrying. Fingers crossed that new appointments, updates and even the long awaited strategy are released very soon. GLA",

I have noticed that market size in stock to the buy side has reduced over recent sessions, this suggests underlying demand for the shares, would not be surprised to see a formidable re-rate from current levels shortly.

Nick's idea was to sit back and watch the value of investments grow, bitcoin and gold in Liberia (through shares in 'buy in' partner accumulating). Now it seems there is a reversal in Ghana - Hamak spend time and money exploring for increased stake while partner accumulate value in Hamak shares.  Perhaps this is a more honest way of making money and could see Hamak becoming a miner or at least progressing further with that until sale of assets.  I like that",

Typically warrant holders will look for at least a 50% positive price margin upside of the warrant price versus the prevailing share price (I.e. The selling SP needs to typically be at least 1.2p) for it to be considered a worthwhile risk to exercise them to make some money via the delta (SP price - Warrant price). Note that the warrant holders ongoing sell off likely causes downward price pressure for the stock. It\u2019s an interesting potential selling overhang for later in 2026 that the BOD needs to try to mitigate for it with some positive news to generate stock liquidity to support warrants clearing it quickly.

          "content": "SMALL CAP MOVERS: London BTC launches gold hedging strategy There are few storytellers and yarn spinners as deft as the small cap market's perennial dealmakers. For every cycle, trend and fad, some closely followed execs tend to find an angle for the small cap investment audience. So it is then, that as gold smashes through $5,000 an ounce and Bitcoin remains 'off the boil', that David Lenigas presents an opportunity and a hedge for shareholders in his vehicle the London BTC Company. London BTC #BTC on Friday announced it had picked up options over gold tenements in Western Australia, giving it a chance to acquire acreage hosting the historic Chance gold mine. At the same time, the small cap firm (valued at around \u00a39.5 million currently) said it would potentially also set up a special purpose vehicle in the US to acquire gold resource assets there too, alongside possible expansions to bitcoin mining operations. 'We like Bitcoin and we like gold, and by linking the two we feel we could create a very exciting platform for growth,' Lenigas explained cogently via RNS. With an eye to future dealmaking, Lenigas added: 'Great gold tenements can be run up the value curve and either developed or sold, and these funds could be used to make us bigger in Bitcoin much quicker.' Evidently, investors following the shares may not have been massively wowed, partly because a move like this had been flagged in November. You can\u2019t make it up . Well you can obviously \ud83d\ude48",

Extract RNS: During the initial nine months of the JV, FAU has significantly advanced the understanding of the structural geology of the Nimba project, through geological mapping, sampling and the drilling of eleven holes for 1,570 metres. The first two holes drilled intersected wide zones of gold mineralisation of 29m at 1g/t Au and 8m at 2.6g/t Au*, which supported Hamak's previous best intersection of 20m at 7g/t Au. Subsequent holes targeting certain structural features have however failed to intersect any meaningful mineralsation with low tenure gold returns only. The defined 5km x 1km strong gold in soil anomaly remains to be explained by the limited drilling undertaken to date and further work is required.  Detailed geochemical soil sampling is ongoing by Hamak over the area of interest to better define future drill targets. During the JV, FAU has expended over A$600,000 on the project. In addition, Hamak has received 100m shares in FAU as well as A$250,000 in cash, in return for issuing FAU a 35% interest in the Nimba project. Both Hamak and FAU have agreed that the 35% interest in Nimba will be returned to Hamak in return for a future Net Smelter Royalty of 2%, which Hamak can repurchase at the production stage for US$1 million for each percentage. Hamak has agreed to sell its 100m shares in FAU off market for A$750,000, being a 17% discount to the 15 day VWAP of the FAU share price. Hamak wil receive the full A$750,000 cash receipts when shares are released from escrow on the 26 February 2026.",

Extract RNS: During the initial nine months of the JV, FAU has significantly advanced the understanding of the structural geology of the Nimba project, through geological mapping, sampling and the drilling of eleven holes for 1,570 metres. The first two holes drilled intersected wide zones of gold mineralisation of 29m at 1g/t Au and 8m at 2.6g/t Au*, which supported Hamak's previous best intersection of 20m at 7g/t Au. Subsequent holes targeting certain structural features have however failed to intersect any meaningful mineralsation with low tenure gold returns only. The defined 5km x 1km strong gold in soil anomaly remains to be explained by the limited drilling undertaken to date and further work is required.  Detailed geochemical soil sampling is ongoing by Hamak over the area of interest to better define future drill targets. During the JV, FAU has expended over A$600,000 on the project. In addition, Hamak has received 100m shares in FAU as well as A$250,000 in cash, in return for issuing FAU a 35% interest in the Nimba project. Both Hamak and FAU have agreed that the 35% interest in Nimba will be returned to Hamak in return for a future Net Smelter Royalty of 2%, which Hamak can repurchase at the production stage for US$1 million for each percentage. Hamak has agreed to sell its 100m shares in FAU off market for A$750,000, being a 17% discount to the 15 day VWAP of the FAU share price. Hamak wil receive the full A$750,000 cash receipts when shares are released from escrow on the 26 February 2026.",

To my knowledge the last update from FAU was the 7th October which stated they were around 1100m into a 3000m drill program but nothing since. Bizarre and a little worrying. Fingers crossed that new appointments, updates and even the long awaited strategy are released very soon. GLA",

I know the Sunday Roast are not the most well regarded in the PR space however they do have contacts and are about to have an interview with the company in the near term, the commentator said he met the founder of Hamak last week and suggests there are some exciting things ahead. I have noticed that market size in stock to the buy side has reduced over recent sessions, this suggests underlying demand for the shares, would not be surprised to see a formidable re-rate from current levels shortly.

It will cost you 0.8p each to exercise them once the one year lock-in period expires (in circa 6 months time on 3rd July 2026). Typically warrant holders will look for at least a 50% positive price margin upside of the warrant price versus the prevailing share price (I.e. The selling SP needs to typically be at least 1.2p) for it to be considered a worthwhile risk to exercise them to make some money via the delta (SP price - Warrant price). Note that the warrant holders ongoing sell off likely causes downward price pressure for the stock. It\u2019s an interesting potential selling overhang for later in 2026 that the BOD needs to try to mitigate for it with some positive news to generate stock liquidity to support warrants clearing it quickly. Finally, reminder that the funds from exercised warrants are adding to the Hamak kitty which is the main positive aspect of warrants.",

It will cost you 0.8p each to exercise them once the one year lock-in period expires (in circa 6 months time on 3rd July 2026). Typically warrant holders will look for at least a 50% positive price margin upside of the warrant price versus the prevailing share price (I.e. The selling SP needs to typically be at least 1.2p) for it to be considered a worthwhile risk to exercise them to make some money via the delta (SP price - Warrant price). Note that the warrant holders ongoing sell off likely causes downward price pressure for the stock. It\u2019s an interesting potential selling overhang for later in 2026 that the BOD needs to try to mitigate for it with some positive news to generate stock liquidity to support warrants clearing it quickly. Finally, reminder that the funds from exercised warrants are adding to the Hamak kitty which is the main positive aspect of warrants.",

          "content": "SMALL CAP MOVERS: London BTC launches gold hedging strategy There are few storytellers and yarn spinners as deft as the small cap market's perennial dealmakers. For every cycle, trend and fad, some closely followed execs tend to find an angle for the small cap investment audience. So it is then, that as gold smashes through $5,000 an ounce and Bitcoin remains 'off the boil', that David Lenigas presents an opportunity and a hedge for shareholders in his vehicle the London BTC Company. London BTC #BTC on Friday announced it had picked up options over gold tenements in Western Australia, giving it a chance to acquire acreage hosting the historic Chance gold mine. At the same time, the small cap firm (valued at around \u00a39.5 million currently) said it would potentially also set up a special purpose vehicle in the US to acquire gold resource assets there too, alongside possible expansions to bitcoin mining operations. 'We like Bitcoin and we like gold, and by linking the two we feel we could create a very exciting platform for growth,' Lenigas explained cogently via RNS. With an eye to future dealmaking, Lenigas added: 'Great gold tenements can be run up the value curve and either developed or sold, and these funds could be used to make us bigger in Bitcoin much quicker.' Evidently, investors following the shares may not have been massively wowed, partly because a move like this had been flagged in November. You can\u2019t make it up . Well you can obviously \ud83d\ude48",

Extract RNS: During the initial nine months of the JV, FAU has significantly advanced the understanding of the structural geology of the Nimba project, through geological mapping, sampling and the drilling of eleven holes for 1,570 metres. The first two holes drilled intersected wide zones of gold mineralisation of 29m at 1g/t Au and 8m at 2.6g/t Au*, which supported Hamak's previous best intersection of 20m at 7g/t Au. Subsequent holes targeting certain structural features have however failed to intersect any meaningful mineralsation with low tenure gold returns only. The defined 5km x 1km strong gold in soil anomaly remains to be explained by the limited drilling undertaken to date and further work is required.  Detailed geochemical soil sampling is ongoing by Hamak over the area of interest to better define future drill targets. During the JV, FAU has expended over A$600,000 on the project. In addition, Hamak has received 100m shares in FAU as well as A$250,000 in cash, in return for issuing FAU a 35% interest in the Nimba project. Both Hamak and FAU have agreed that the 35% interest in Nimba will be returned to Hamak in return for a future Net Smelter Royalty of 2%, which Hamak can repurchase at the production stage for US$1 million for each percentage. Hamak has agreed to sell its 100m shares in FAU off market for A$750,000, being a 17% discount to the 15 day VWAP of the FAU share price. Hamak wil receive the full A$750,000 cash receipts when shares are released from escrow on the 26 February 2026.",

Extract RNS: During the initial nine months of the JV, FAU has significantly advanced the understanding of the structural geology of the Nimba project, through geological mapping, sampling and the drilling of eleven holes for 1,570 metres. The first two holes drilled intersected wide zones of gold mineralisation of 29m at 1g/t Au and 8m at 2.6g/t Au*, which supported Hamak's previous best intersection of 20m at 7g/t Au. Subsequent holes targeting certain structural features have however failed to intersect any meaningful mineralsation with low tenure gold returns only. The defined 5km x 1km strong gold in soil anomaly remains to be explained by the limited drilling undertaken to date and further work is required.  Detailed geochemical soil sampling is ongoing by Hamak over the area of interest to better define future drill targets. During the JV, FAU has expended over A$600,000 on the project. In addition, Hamak has received 100m shares in FAU as well as A$250,000 in cash, in return for issuing FAU a 35% interest in the Nimba project. Both Hamak and FAU have agreed that the 35% interest in Nimba will be returned to Hamak in return for a future Net Smelter Royalty of 2%, which Hamak can repurchase at the production stage for US$1 million for each percentage. Hamak has agreed to sell its 100m shares in FAU off market for A$750,000, being a 17% discount to the 15 day VWAP of the FAU share price. Hamak wil receive the full A$750,000 cash receipts when shares are released from escrow on the 26 February 2026.",

Even if it's just a 'The drilling is now complete and we await assay results' etc I really don't believe that they know 'nothing more' and have no further updates to give. I sure hope something big is brewing as things currently don't feel right. GLA",

To my knowledge the last update from FAU was the 7th October which stated they were around 1100m into a 3000m drill program but nothing since. Bizarre and a little worrying. Fingers crossed that new appointments, updates and even the long awaited strategy are released very soon. GLA",

I have noticed that market size in stock to the buy side has reduced over recent sessions, this suggests underlying demand for the shares, would not be surprised to see a formidable re-rate from current levels shortly.

          "content": "SMALL CAP MOVERS: London BTC launches gold hedging strategy There are few storytellers and yarn spinners as deft as the small cap market's perennial dealmakers. For every cycle, trend and fad, some closely followed execs tend to find an angle for the small cap investment audience. So it is then, that as gold smashes through $5,000 an ounce and Bitcoin remains 'off the boil', that David Lenigas presents an opportunity and a hedge for shareholders in his vehicle the London BTC Company. London BTC #BTC on Friday announced it had picked up options over gold tenements in Western Australia, giving it a chance to acquire acreage hosting the historic Chance gold mine. At the same time, the small cap firm (valued at around \u00a39.5 million currently) said it would potentially also set up a special purpose vehicle in the US to acquire gold resource assets there too, alongside possible expansions to bitcoin mining operations. 'We like Bitcoin and we like gold, and by linking the two we feel we could create a very exciting platform for growth,' Lenigas explained cogently via RNS. With an eye to future dealmaking, Lenigas added: 'Great gold tenements can be run up the value curve and either developed or sold, and these funds could be used to make us bigger in Bitcoin much quicker.' Evidently, investors following the shares may not have been massively wowed, partly because a move like this had been flagged in November. You can\u2019t make it up . Well you can obviously \ud83d\ude48",

Extract RNS: During the initial nine months of the JV, FAU has significantly advanced the understanding of the structural geology of the Nimba project, through geological mapping, sampling and the drilling of eleven holes for 1,570 metres. The first two holes drilled intersected wide zones of gold mineralisation of 29m at 1g/t Au and 8m at 2.6g/t Au*, which supported Hamak's previous best intersection of 20m at 7g/t Au. Subsequent holes targeting certain structural features have however failed to intersect any meaningful mineralsation with low tenure gold returns only. The defined 5km x 1km strong gold in soil anomaly remains to be explained by the limited drilling undertaken to date and further work is required.  Detailed geochemical soil sampling is ongoing by Hamak over the area of interest to better define future drill targets. During the JV, FAU has expended over A$600,000 on the project. In addition, Hamak has received 100m shares in FAU as well as A$250,000 in cash, in return for issuing FAU a 35% interest in the Nimba project. Both Hamak and FAU have agreed that the 35% interest in Nimba will be returned to Hamak in return for a future Net Smelter Royalty of 2%, which Hamak can repurchase at the production stage for US$1 million for each percentage. Hamak has agreed to sell its 100m shares in FAU off market for A$750,000, being a 17% discount to the 15 day VWAP of the FAU share price. Hamak wil receive the full A$750,000 cash receipts when shares are released from escrow on the 26 February 2026.",

Extract RNS: During the initial nine months of the JV, FAU has significantly advanced the understanding of the structural geology of the Nimba project, through geological mapping, sampling and the drilling of eleven holes for 1,570 metres. The first two holes drilled intersected wide zones of gold mineralisation of 29m at 1g/t Au and 8m at 2.6g/t Au*, which supported Hamak's previous best intersection of 20m at 7g/t Au. Subsequent holes targeting certain structural features have however failed to intersect any meaningful mineralsation with low tenure gold returns only. The defined 5km x 1km strong gold in soil anomaly remains to be explained by the limited drilling undertaken to date and further work is required.  Detailed geochemical soil sampling is ongoing by Hamak over the area of interest to better define future drill targets. During the JV, FAU has expended over A$600,000 on the project. In addition, Hamak has received 100m shares in FAU as well as A$250,000 in cash, in return for issuing FAU a 35% interest in the Nimba project. Both Hamak and FAU have agreed that the 35% interest in Nimba will be returned to Hamak in return for a future Net Smelter Royalty of 2%, which Hamak can repurchase at the production stage for US$1 million for each percentage. Hamak has agreed to sell its 100m shares in FAU off market for A$750,000, being a 17% discount to the 15 day VWAP of the FAU share price. Hamak wil receive the full A$750,000 cash receipts when shares are released from escrow on the 26 February 2026.",

The communication has much room for improvement. What's happened to the FAU drilling program for example? To my knowledge the last update from FAU was the 7th October which stated they were around 1100m into a 3000m drill program but nothing since. Bizarre and a little worrying. Fingers crossed that new appointments, updates and even the long awaited strategy are released very soon. GLA",

I know the Sunday Roast are not the most well regarded in the PR space however they do have contacts and are about to have an interview with the company in the near term, the commentator said he met the founder of Hamak last week and suggests there are some exciting things ahead. I have noticed that market size in stock to the buy side has reduced over recent sessions, this suggests underlying demand for the shares, would not be surprised to see a formidable re-rate from current levels shortly.

Typically warrant holders will look for at least a 50% positive price margin upside of the warrant price versus the prevailing share price (I.e. The selling SP needs to typically be at least 1.2p) for it to be considered a worthwhile risk to exercise them to make some money via the delta (SP price - Warrant price). Note that the warrant holders ongoing sell off likely causes downward price pressure for the stock. It\u2019s an interesting potential selling overhang for later in 2026 that the BOD needs to try to mitigate for it with some positive news to generate stock liquidity to support warrants clearing it quickly.

It will cost you 0.8p each to exercise them once the one year lock-in period expires (in circa 6 months time on 3rd July 2026). Typically warrant holders will look for at least a 50% positive price margin upside of the warrant price versus the prevailing share price (I.e. The selling SP needs to typically be at least 1.2p) for it to be considered a worthwhile risk to exercise them to make some money via the delta (SP price - Warrant price). Note that the warrant holders ongoing sell off likely causes downward price pressure for the stock. It\u2019s an interesting potential selling overhang for later in 2026 that the BOD needs to try to mitigate for it with some positive news to generate stock liquidity to support warrants clearing it quickly. Finally, reminder that the funds from exercised warrants are adding to the Hamak kitty which is the main positive aspect of warrants.",

          "content": "SMALL CAP MOVERS: London BTC launches gold hedging strategy There are few storytellers and yarn spinners as deft as the small cap market's perennial dealmakers. For every cycle, trend and fad, some closely followed execs tend to find an angle for the small cap investment audience. So it is then, that as gold smashes through $5,000 an ounce and Bitcoin remains 'off the boil', that David Lenigas presents an opportunity and a hedge for shareholders in his vehicle the London BTC Company. London BTC #BTC on Friday announced it had picked up options over gold tenements in Western Australia, giving it a chance to acquire acreage hosting the historic Chance gold mine. At the same time, the small cap firm (valued at around \u00a39.5 million currently) said it would potentially also set up a special purpose vehicle in the US to acquire gold resource assets there too, alongside possible expansions to bitcoin mining operations. 'We like Bitcoin and we like gold, and by linking the two we feel we could create a very exciting platform for growth,' Lenigas explained cogently via RNS. With an eye to future dealmaking, Lenigas added: 'Great gold tenements can be run up the value curve and either developed or sold, and these funds could be used to make us bigger in Bitcoin much quicker.' Evidently, investors following the shares may not have been massively wowed, partly because a move like this had been flagged in November. You can\u2019t make it up . Well you can obviously \ud83d\ude48",

The defined 5km x 1km strong gold in soil anomaly remains to be explained by the limited drilling undertaken to date and further work is required.  Detailed geochemical soil sampling is ongoing by Hamak over the area of interest to better define future drill targets. During the JV, FAU has expended over A$600,000 on the project. In addition, Hamak has received 100m shares in FAU as well as A$250,000 in cash, in return for issuing FAU a 35% interest in the Nimba project. Both Hamak and FAU have agreed that the 35% interest in Nimba will be returned to Hamak in return for a future Net Smelter Royalty of 2%, which Hamak can repurchase at the production stage for US$1 million for each percentage. Hamak has agreed to sell its 100m shares in FAU off market for A$750,000, being a 17% discount to the 15 day VWAP of the FAU share price. Hamak wil receive the full A$750,000 cash receipts when shares are released from escrow on the 26 February 2026.",

Detailed geochemical soil sampling is ongoing by Hamak over the area of interest to better define future drill targets. During the JV, FAU has expended over A$600,000 on the project.

The communication has much room for improvement. What's happened to the FAU drilling program for example? To my knowledge the last update from FAU was the 7th October which stated they were around 1100m into a 3000m drill program but nothing since. Bizarre and a little worrying. Fingers crossed that new appointments, updates and even the long awaited strategy are released very soon. GLA",

I know the Sunday Roast are not the most well regarded in the PR space however they do have contacts and are about to have an interview with the company in the near term, the commentator said he met the founder of Hamak last week and suggests there are some exciting things ahead. I have noticed that market size in stock to the buy side has reduced over recent sessions, this suggests underlying demand for the shares, would not be surprised to see a formidable re-rate from current levels shortly. Link to the podcast mention below, Hamak is covered at 1 hour 34 minutes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NASsfp1Dpk&t=4886s",

Now it seems there is a reversal in Ghana - Hamak spend time and money exploring for increased stake while partner accumulate value in Hamak shares.  Perhaps this is a more honest way of making money and could see Hamak becoming a miner or at least progressing further with that until sale of assets.  I like that",

Paid promoters like Proactive, Roast, Stockbox and Traders Cafe are parasites on the market. Those who are being paid to promote should be forced to declare it at the start of every interview because then everyone knows it is an opinion that has been bought, not formed independently. They are takers from the market and add nothing to debate. Just a mouthpiece for poor performers, and in some cases outright wrong'uns. Who pays these grifters? The companies they promote. Who pays for that? The shareholders. YOU, HERE indirectly subsidise this drivel. Some (like Troajan) actively amplify it! Good companies do not need paid promoters to ramp their stocks. Good companies deliver profitable growth and let that do the talking for their share price. IMHO any stock that pays for Proactive or Roast PR promotion is an immediate sell and avoid.

Typically warrant holders will look for at least a 50% positive price margin upside of the warrant price versus the prevailing share price (I.e. The selling SP needs to typically be at least 1.2p) for it to be considered a worthwhile risk to exercise them to make some money via the delta (SP price - Warrant price). Note that the warrant holders ongoing sell off likely causes downward price pressure for the stock. It\u2019s an interesting potential selling overhang for later in 2026 that the BOD needs to try to mitigate for it with some positive news to generate stock liquidity to support warrants clearing it quickly.

It will cost you 0.8p each to exercise them once the one year lock-in period expires (in circa 6 months time on 3rd July 2026). Typically warrant holders will look for at least a 50% positive price margin upside of the warrant price versus the prevailing share price (I.e. The selling SP needs to typically be at least 1.2p) for it to be considered a worthwhile risk to exercise them to make some money via the delta (SP price - Warrant price). Note that the warrant holders ongoing sell off likely causes downward price pressure for the stock. It\u2019s an interesting potential selling overhang for later in 2026 that the BOD needs to try to mitigate for it with some positive news to generate stock liquidity to support warrants clearing it quickly. Finally, reminder that the funds from exercised warrants are adding to the Hamak kitty which is the main positive aspect of warrants.",

          "content": "SMALL CAP MOVERS: London BTC launches gold hedging strategy There are few storytellers and yarn spinners as deft as the small cap market's perennial dealmakers. For every cycle, trend and fad, some closely followed execs tend to find an angle for the small cap investment audience. So it is then, that as gold smashes through $5,000 an ounce and Bitcoin remains 'off the boil', that David Lenigas presents an opportunity and a hedge for shareholders in his vehicle the London BTC Company. London BTC #BTC on Friday announced it had picked up options over gold tenements in Western Australia, giving it a chance to acquire acreage hosting the historic Chance gold mine. At the same time, the small cap firm (valued at around \u00a39.5 million currently) said it would potentially also set up a special purpose vehicle in the US to acquire gold resource assets there too, alongside possible expansions to bitcoin mining operations. 'We like Bitcoin and we like gold, and by linking the two we feel we could create a very exciting platform for growth,' Lenigas explained cogently via RNS. With an eye to future dealmaking, Lenigas added: 'Great gold tenements can be run up the value curve and either developed or sold, and these funds could be used to make us bigger in Bitcoin much quicker.' Evidently, investors following the shares may not have been massively wowed, partly because a move like this had been flagged in November. You can\u2019t make it up . Well you can obviously \ud83d\ude48",

Extract RNS: During the initial nine months of the JV, FAU has significantly advanced the understanding of the structural geology of the Nimba project, through geological mapping, sampling and the drilling of eleven holes for 1,570 metres. The first two holes drilled intersected wide zones of gold mineralisation of 29m at 1g/t Au and 8m at 2.6g/t Au*, which supported Hamak's previous best intersection of 20m at 7g/t Au. Subsequent holes targeting certain structural features have however failed to intersect any meaningful mineralsation with low tenure gold returns only. The defined 5km x 1km strong gold in soil anomaly remains to be explained by the limited drilling undertaken to date and further work is required.  Detailed geochemical soil sampling is ongoing by Hamak over the area of interest to better define future drill targets. During the JV, FAU has expended over A$600,000 on the project. In addition, Hamak has received 100m shares in FAU as well as A$250,000 in cash, in return for issuing FAU a 35% interest in the Nimba project. Both Hamak and FAU have agreed that the 35% interest in Nimba will be returned to Hamak in return for a future Net Smelter Royalty of 2%, which Hamak can repurchase at the production stage for US$1 million for each percentage. Hamak has agreed to sell its 100m shares in FAU off market for A$750,000, being a 17% discount to the 15 day VWAP of the FAU share price. Hamak wil receive the full A$750,000 cash receipts when shares are released from escrow on the 26 February 2026.",

Extract RNS: During the initial nine months of the JV, FAU has significantly advanced the understanding of the structural geology of the Nimba project, through geological mapping, sampling and the drilling of eleven holes for 1,570 metres. The first two holes drilled intersected wide zones of gold mineralisation of 29m at 1g/t Au and 8m at 2.6g/t Au*, which supported Hamak's previous best intersection of 20m at 7g/t Au. Subsequent holes targeting certain structural features have however failed to intersect any meaningful mineralsation with low tenure gold returns only. The defined 5km x 1km strong gold in soil anomaly remains to be explained by the limited drilling undertaken to date and further work is required.  Detailed geochemical soil sampling is ongoing by Hamak over the area of interest to better define future drill targets. During the JV, FAU has expended over A$600,000 on the project. In addition, Hamak has received 100m shares in FAU as well as A$250,000 in cash, in return for issuing FAU a 35% interest in the Nimba project. Both Hamak and FAU have agreed that the 35% interest in Nimba will be returned to Hamak in return for a future Net Smelter Royalty of 2%, which Hamak can repurchase at the production stage for US$1 million for each percentage. Hamak has agreed to sell its 100m shares in FAU off market for A$750,000, being a 17% discount to the 15 day VWAP of the FAU share price. Hamak wil receive the full A$750,000 cash receipts when shares are released from escrow on the 26 February 2026.",

The communication has much room for improvement. What's happened to the FAU drilling program for example? To my knowledge the last update from FAU was the 7th October which stated they were around 1100m into a 3000m drill program but nothing since. Bizarre and a little worrying. Fingers crossed that new appointments, updates and even the long awaited strategy are released very soon. GLA",

I know the Sunday Roast are not the most well regarded in the PR space however they do have contacts and are about to have an interview with the company in the near term, the commentator said he met the founder of Hamak last week and suggests there are some exciting things ahead. I have noticed that market size in stock to the buy side has reduced over recent sessions, this suggests underlying demand for the shares, would not be surprised to see a formidable re-rate from current levels shortly. Link to the podcast mention below, Hamak is covered at 1 hour 34 minutes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NASsfp1Dpk&t=4886s",

          "content": "I see you had a long form interview on The Sunday Roast this week. That's a big sell signal for me. Paid promoters like Proactive, Roast, Stockbox and Traders Cafe are parasites on the market. Those who are being paid to promote should be forced to declare it at the start of every interview because then everyone knows it is an opinion that has been bought, not formed independently. They are takers from the market and add nothing to debate. Just a mouthpiece for poor performers, and in some cases outright wrong'uns. Who pays these grifters? The companies they promote. Who pays for that? The shareholders. YOU, HERE indirectly subsidise this drivel. Some (like Troajan) actively amplify it! Good companies do not need paid promoters to ramp their stocks. Good companies deliver profitable growth and let that do the talking for their share price. IMHO any stock that pays for Proactive or Roast PR promotion is an immediate sell and avoid. For financial masochists only.",

For every cycle, trend and fad, some closely followed execs tend to find an angle for the small cap investment audience. So it is then, that as gold smashes through $5,000 an ounce and Bitcoin remains 'off the boil', that David Lenigas presents an opportunity and a hedge for shareholders in his vehicle the London BTC Company. London BTC #BTC on Friday announced it had picked up options over gold tenements in Western Australia, giving it a chance to acquire acreage hosting the historic Chance gold mine. At the same time, the small cap firm (valued at around \u00a39.5 million currently) said it would potentially also set up a special purpose vehicle in the US to acquire gold resource assets there too, alongside possible expansions to bitcoin mining operations. 'We like Bitcoin and we like gold, and by linking the two we feel we could create a very exciting platform for growth,' Lenigas explained cogently via RNS. With an eye to future dealmaking, Lenigas added: 'Great gold tenements can be run up the value curve and either developed or sold, and these funds could be used to make us bigger in Bitcoin much quicker.' Evidently, investors following the shares may not have been massively wowed, partly because a move like this had been flagged in November. You can\u2019t make it up . Well you can obviously \ud83d\ude48",

Extract RNS: During the initial nine months of the JV, FAU has significantly advanced the understanding of the structural geology of the Nimba project, through geological mapping, sampling and the drilling of eleven holes for 1,570 metres. The first two holes drilled intersected wide zones of gold mineralisation of 29m at 1g/t Au and 8m at 2.6g/t Au*, which supported Hamak's previous best intersection of 20m at 7g/t Au. Subsequent holes targeting certain structural features have however failed to intersect any meaningful mineralsation with low tenure gold returns only. The defined 5km x 1km strong gold in soil anomaly remains to be explained by the limited drilling undertaken to date and further work is required.  Detailed geochemical soil sampling is ongoing by Hamak over the area of interest to better define future drill targets. During the JV, FAU has expended over A$600,000 on the project. In addition, Hamak has received 100m shares in FAU as well as A$250,000 in cash, in return for issuing FAU a 35% interest in the Nimba project. Both Hamak and FAU have agreed that the 35% interest in Nimba will be returned to Hamak in return for a future Net Smelter Royalty of 2%, which Hamak can repurchase at the production stage for US$1 million for each percentage. Hamak has agreed to sell its 100m shares in FAU off market for A$750,000, being a 17% discount to the 15 day VWAP of the FAU share price. Hamak wil receive the full A$750,000 cash receipts when shares are released from escrow on the 26 February 2026.",

Extract RNS: During the initial nine months of the JV, FAU has significantly advanced the understanding of the structural geology of the Nimba project, through geological mapping, sampling and the drilling of eleven holes for 1,570 metres. The first two holes drilled intersected wide zones of gold mineralisation of 29m at 1g/t Au and 8m at 2.6g/t Au*, which supported Hamak's previous best intersection of 20m at 7g/t Au. Subsequent holes targeting certain structural features have however failed to intersect any meaningful mineralsation with low tenure gold returns only. The defined 5km x 1km strong gold in soil anomaly remains to be explained by the limited drilling undertaken to date and further work is required.  Detailed geochemical soil sampling is ongoing by Hamak over the area of interest to better define future drill targets. During the JV, FAU has expended over A$600,000 on the project. In addition, Hamak has received 100m shares in FAU as well as A$250,000 in cash, in return for issuing FAU a 35% interest in the Nimba project. Both Hamak and FAU have agreed that the 35% interest in Nimba will be returned to Hamak in return for a future Net Smelter Royalty of 2%, which Hamak can repurchase at the production stage for US$1 million for each percentage. Hamak has agreed to sell its 100m shares in FAU off market for A$750,000, being a 17% discount to the 15 day VWAP of the FAU share price. Hamak wil receive the full A$750,000 cash receipts when shares are released from escrow on the 26 February 2026.",

The communication has much room for improvement. What's happened to the FAU drilling program for example? To my knowledge the last update from FAU was the 7th October which stated they were around 1100m into a 3000m drill program but nothing since. Bizarre and a little worrying. Fingers crossed that new appointments, updates and even the long awaited strategy are released very soon. GLA",

I know the Sunday Roast are not the most well regarded in the PR space however they do have contacts and are about to have an interview with the company in the near term, the commentator said he met the founder of Hamak last week and suggests there are some exciting things ahead. I have noticed that market size in stock to the buy side has reduced over recent sessions, this suggests underlying demand for the shares, would not be surprised to see a formidable re-rate from current levels shortly.
