The Company has a strong patent portfolio and continues to seek additional protection in other key markets globally. In addition to its existing patent coverage in the USA, a further application is likely to be granted\nby\nthe United States patent and trademark office in due course.\nThe patent 'Use of a fibrinogen capture agent to detect a CIZ1B variant' concerns a two-step test format developed by Cizzle at the University of York. This test format is licensed to\nCizzle Bio Inc (\"BIO\") for use in North America and\nthe Caribbean and these new patents will strengthen BIO's position in commercialising the Company's innovative and proprietary technology.\nBackground\nThe discovery and development of the CIZ1B biomarker test is the product of work by Professor Dawn Coverley, the Company's founder and CSO, and her research team at the University of York. Initially supported by both UK Research and Industry and Charity sector research grants it has been the ambition to translate the laboratory findings into products that benefit future cancer patients in the UK, and elsewhere around the world.\nCizzle Biotechnology\n's\npatent portfolio and technology know-how enhances the Company's ability to deliver it's global\ncommercial strategy to licence globally its proprietary test for the CIZ1B biomarker for use in the early detection of lung cancer. The Company's first licence agreement with BIO for North America and the Caribbean, has led to partnerships between BIO and specialist clinical laboratories and hospitals, to enable market penetration that makes the test available to as many clinicians and patients as possible.\nCizzle Biotechnology\nalso has been granted patent protection from the European Patent Office and is now focussed on securing partnerships with accredited facilities in the UK and Europe\nincluding the NHS.\nThis aligns well with the current NHS cancer plan which aims to dramatically improve cancer survival by increasing the proportion of cancers diagnosed at stages 1 and 2 from half to three-quarters by 2028. This shift towards earlier diagnosis is expected to save 55,000 additional lives per year by 2028. The plan focuses on improving access to diagnosis and treatment, raising awareness of cancer symptoms, and increasing the number of cancers identified through screening, including personalised and risk-stratified approaches.\nCommenting, Dawn Coverley, Chief Scientific Officer of Cizzle Biotechnology, said:\n\"The granted patents that cover the specific test format that we are taking to market with our partners in North America and elsewhere will protect the Company's offering and add an additional level of security for our shareholders. They help to ensure that the Company's innovative and\ncommercially scalable\nCIZ1B biomarker\ntest will bring benefit to cancer patients, through the roll out of early detection programs.\"\nEnquiries:\nCizzle Biotechnology Holdings plc\nVia IFC Advisory\nAllan Syms (Executive Chairman)\nAllenby Capital Limited\n+44(0) 20 3328 5656\nJohn Depasquale / Piers Shimwell (Corporate Finance)\nAmrit Nahal (Sales and Corporate Broking)\nIFC Advisory Limited\n+44(0) 20 3934 6630\nTim Metcalfe\nFlorence Staton\nAbout Cizzle Biotechnology\nThe CIZ1B biomarker is a naturally occurring variant of the cell nuclear protein CIZ1, which is linked with the preservation of epigenetic integrity. CIZ1B is highly associated with the presence of early-stage lung cancer and can be measured in small quantities of blood. The company has developed CIZ1B into a non-invasive, cost-effective blood test to help in the early detection of lung cancer and has now entered commercial royalty-bearing arrangements to license its proprietary technology, and into collaborations with centres of excellence in cancer care.

With an established route to market in North America and the Caribbean, we are committed to ensure that patients in the UK and elsewhere in Europe will also have access to a simple, non-invasive means to find cancer early when curative intervention is possible.\nSecuring ongoing support from all our shareholders is critical in this journey and we want to thank in particular the significant investment and support we have received from Frazer Lang and his family. The further funding being received from Mr Lang provides important capital to accelerate our plans for growth and to make the test available to as many patients as soon as possible. In addition to the new programme in the UK,\nthe Company will also continue to\nsupport its US partner Cizzle BIO Inc, to secure CLIA accreditation to take the test live in the near term, and to complete the ongoing Moffitt study to t\nest patients with suspicious lung nodules in a clinical evaluation, as announced on 9 September 2024.\"\nCommenting, Frazer Lang said:\n\"I am delighted to extend my support for Cizzle through this additional funding, building on my existing shareholding.

The LOI covers the\nverification and validation of the Company's CIZ1B biomarker test with a NHS Foundation Trust partner\nin state-of-the-art laboratories\nwhich may lead to the Provider being appointed as the Company's exclusive UK supplier of the CIZ1B test.\nThe discovery and development of the CIZ1B biomarker test is the result of many years of pioneering work by Professor Dawn Coverley, the Company's founder and CSO, and her research team at the University of York. Initially supported by Yorkshire Cancer Research it has always been the ambition to ensure patients and healthcare professionals in the NHS and elsewhere should benefit from the Company's work in early cancer detection as part of its commercial roll out plans.\nAs part of the Company's commercial strategy to licence its proprietary test for the CIZ1B biomarker for use in the early detection of lung cancer globally, it has already secured a licence agreement in North America and the Caribbean, with guaranteed royalties and up-front fees of US$2.4 million, of which US$530,000 has already been received.\nOn 20 May 2025, the Company secured funding of \u00a3150,000 through the issue of convertible loan notes from the Company's existing shareholder, Frazer Lang\nto provide additional funding\nto support the Company's growth strategy, in particular to roll out its CIZ1B early cancer test\nin the UK and elsewhere in Europe. The intended partnership with the Provider, which for commercial reasons is confidential at this time, is a result of that programme.\nHaving established a route to market in North America and the Caribbean, the Company was keen to ensure that patients in the UK and then elsewhere in Europe, will also benefit from how the CIZ1B biomarker test can help in early lung cancer detection. This aligns with the current NHS cancer plan to improve cancer survival by increasing the proportion of cancers diagnosed at stages 1 and 2 with an aim to save 55,000 lives per year by 2028. A key element of this is improving access to early diagnosis, and increasing the number of cancers identified through screening.\nUnder the terms of the LOI,\nthe Provider will immediately carry out a validation exercise with the Company and provide clinical input for the intended clinical indication of CIZ1B. Cizzle will provide on-site technical support under the guidance of Professor Coverley to confirm assay performance data. Following agreed success criteria, the parties will negotiate a Partnership Agreement for the commercialisation of the CIZ1B test. The Provider may then be appointed as the exclusive UK supplier of the CIZ1B test (subject to regulatory frameworks, including CE/UKCA/HIE requirements) and together, Cizzle and the Provider will jointly develop a go-to-market strategy, including co-branding and aligned communications. A commercial distribution model based on revenue share or a licensing structure, with a rollout strategy beyond the UK into Europe across private and NHS markets, will be negotiated.\nThe Company will also continue to focus on\nsupporting its US partner Cizzle BIO Inc, to secure CLIA accreditation to take the test live in the near term, and on completing the ongoing Moffitt study to t\nest patients with suspicious lung nodules in a clinical evaluation, as announced on 9 September 2024.\nCommenting, Allan Syms, Executive Chairman of Cizzle Biotechnology, said:\n\"We announced in May 2025 that while continuing to support the Company's licensing partner in North America, we would now be seeking an additional licensing partnership in the UK and rest of Europe. We are excited to report we have now entered a LOI with a leading UK provider\nwith partnerships with NHS Foundation Trusts. Our goal is to provide a first-class service to help drive early cancer detection at scale globally.\nWe are now pleased that t\nhe UK will be the next phase\nof our growth plans in making the test available to many patients as soon as possible.\nEnquiries:\nCizzle Biotechnology Holdings plc\nVia IFC Advisory\nAllan Syms (Executive Chairman)\nAllenby Capital Limited\n+44(0) 20 3328 5656\nJohn Depasquale / Piers Shimwell (Corporate Finance)\nAmrit Nahal (Sales and Corporate Broking)\nIFC Advisory Limited\n+44(0) 20 3934 6630\nTim Metcalfe\nFlorence Chandler\nAbout Cizzle Biotechnology\nThe CIZ1B biomarker test for early-stage lung cancer is based on the pioneering work of Professor Coverley,\nthe Founder and CSO of the Company, and her research team at the University of York\n.

Omni Health Diagnostics (\"Omni\") announced in September 2025 that the roll out programme will be nationwide in at least six states with potential further expansion. This demonstrates how BIO intends to scale its operations to meet expected demand in the USA.\n\u00b7\nMoffitt Cancer Center Collaboration\n: On 9 September 2024, the Group was selected by Moffitt Cancer Center (\"Moffitt\"), Florida's leading cancer hospital, to test patients with suspicious lung nodules in a clinical evaluation using the Group's proprietary CIZ1B biomarker assay. Since then, Moffitt has been recruiting patients and collecting blood samples to ship to the University of York. We expect samples to be received shortly and testing to begin in Q4 2025. This important study to test patients for the presence of the CIZ1B Biomarker is part of a major clinical evaluation for suspected lung cancer patients.\nCommenting Allan Syms, Chairman of Cizzle Biotechnology, said\n:\n\"The first half of 2025 has been a period focussed on validation, accreditation and building, together with our licensing partner Cizzle BIO in the USA, a comprehensive base from which our simple blood test to help in the early detection of lung cancer can be launched for commercial use. Enabled by\nthe Company's agreement with\nBBI Solutions (\"BBI\"),\nan\nestablished accredited supplier who now manufacture our antibodies in their\nISO 13485-certified facilities\n, BIO has completed its pathfinder programme and entered into an agreement with Omni Health Diagnostics to launch the test across the USA through multiple sites to meet expected demand. BIO have invested in significant marketing and partnership campaigns to build awareness through a co-ordinated campaign and are now poised for commercial launch. The accreditation process is underway at Omni, who expect to obtain CLIA accreditation and launch in the near future. The Company continues to receive payments from BIO as part of the advanced royalty schedule, which demonstrates the close working relationship we have as we create a platform to help detect lung cancer early. The Company is now expanding its licensing activities elsewhere, including in the UK, and we look forward to updating our shareholders with progress in due course.\"\nExecutive Chairman's Statement\nOperational and strategic overview\nIn Cancer Research UK's report on 'Early Detection and Diagnosis of Cancer: A Roadmap to the Future' *Professor Chris Whitty, Chief Medical Officer for England and Chief Scientific Adviser for the Department of Health and Social Care said \"\nThe early detection and diagnosis of serious disease, including cancer, changes outcomes substantially. If cancer can be intercepted at the earliest clinically relevant timepoint this gives a much better chance of survival and an improved quality of life.\"\nWith over 5,000 people daily losing their lives to lung cancer and the main reason being the lack of early detection, the Group's technology aims to eliminate barriers, empowering patients and healthcare providers with a cutting-edge solution to one of the greatest challenges in modern medicine. The Group's vision is a global shift in lung cancer survival through accurate, low cost, non-invasive early detection at scale. The Group remains focussed on the systematic development and commercialisation of novel and proprietary clinical diagnostic tests for the early detection of cancer particularly where there is an unmet clinical need.\nThe Group's platform technology is based on the ability to detect a stable plasma biomarker, a variant of a normal protein, CIZ1, which is a naturally occurring cell nuclear protein involved in DNA replication. The targeted CIZ1B variant is highly correlated with early-stage lung cancer and since the Group's admission to the London Stock Exchange in 2021, it has invested in the development of its technology to enable its full commercialisation through a global licensing and partnership strategy.\nWith the commercial manufacture of CIZ1B monoclonal antibodies now established, and a guaranteed royalty stream being generated by our first licensing partner BIO in North America and the Caribbean, and validation of the test in progress, it is anticipated that commercial sales will begin in the near future followed by further licensing and partnership deals elsewhere in the world.\n*https://assets.ctfassets.net/u7vsjnoopqo5/2Q32Uv00MxEAUS34Gw8WHk/68ee767b745332d8ce1daf81037807dc/early_detection_diagnosis_of_cancer_roadmap.pdf\nResearch and Development Progress\nBased on the original published research by Professor Coverley and her team at the University of York, it has been shown that CIZ1B can be measured with high sensitivity that should allow for non-intrusive, cost-effective testing in a high-throughput, hospital-friendly format, and in the future a potential rapid point of care test for use in doctors' offices and pharmacies. During the period, Cizzle continued to support its research agreement and collaboration with the University of York which has been extended to 28 June 2026. The Group has reported the successful generation and subsequent manufacture of its proprietary monoclonal antibodies by BBI, the world's largest independent producer of immunodiagnostic reagents. Entry into production of this central component of the Company's test to detect the presence of the CIZ1B biomarker, was an inflexion point in enabling the clinical validation process to be undertaken.\nProfessor Coverley's team have been instrumental in their support to BIO's pathfinder laboratory and to Omni Health Diagnostics in providing a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) which serves as an operational guide for the clinical laboratories that will seek CLIA accreditation of the CIZ1B test as a LDT in North America. This ensures uniformity in performance, quality control, and adherence to regulations, which reduces errors, improves safety, and preserves institutional knowledge within an organisation and is essential in obtaining regulatory validation in the near term.\nThe Group announced on 9 September 2024 that it had been selected by the Moffitt Cancer Center, the number one cancer hospital in Florida and the Southeast USA, to test patients with suspicious lung nodules in a clinical evaluation using the Group's proprietary CIZ1B biomarker assay. Since then, Moffitt has been recruiting a large patient cohort and will send the first batch of blood samples to be tested for the CIZ1B Biomarker at the University of York. As previously reported, this will for the first time be analysing patient blood samples to determine biomarker accuracy in predicting whether or not a lung nodule is likely to be cancer as part of a real-world clinical evaluation in a hospital setting.\nLicensing Strategy and Commercial Progress\nThe Company continues to operate a global licensing and partnership strategy because the directors believe this is the fastest and most cost-effective means to bring its technology to market. For product solutions, an outsourcing approach has been adopted which aims to leverage external partners expertise and to provide an effective cost management process. As such the Group has benefited from its research and development agreement with the University of York through access to skilled scientists and laboratory facilities. It has also produced commercial antibodies through agreement with an industry leading and iso 13485 accredited facility, and has secured its first royalty bearing licensing agreement in North America and the Caribbean. The licensing approach of up-front fees and guaranteed royalties has generated important revenue for the Group, avoided the need to fund and build an expert team in the licensed territory and as such accelerated market deployment and installation of laboratory testing accreditation and testing capability.\nBIO is now completing validation of the test with its new clinical diagnostics laboratory group, Omni Health Diagnostics (\"Omni\"), as part of a national expansion strategy based on Omni's active laboratory acquisitions and partnerships programme to provide testing capability in Texas, New York, California, South Carolina, Tennessee and Florida which will provide nationwide testing coverage. It is expected that BIO will add further clinical laboratory partners as required to be able to meet anticipated market demand across North America when the test completes Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (\"CLIA\") accreditation as a Laboratory Developed Test (\"LDT\").\nThe anticipated commercial launch of the Group's CIZ1B test in the USA is expected to be followed by the Group's expansion into different geographies, and maximise speed and scale of market entry through specialist licensing partners globally. The Group's next focus will be in the UK and Europe.\nFunding\nDuring the period, the Group\nannounced that it has raised \u00a3150,000 through the issue of a convertible loan note (the \"Note\"), to provide additional funding\nto support the Company's growth strategy, in particular to seek partnerships for its CIZ1B early cancer test\nin the UK and elsewhere in Europe, following the successful licensing agreement with BIO in North America.\nThe Note, which was subscribed for by Frazer Lang, an existing investor in the Company, is convertible at any time, at the election of the Note holder, during its 24-month term into new ordinary shares in the Company at a price of 1.4 pence per share. No interest is payable on the Note.\nOn 18 August 2025, the Company announced\nBIO's appointment of a new multi-site full scale COLA and CLIA accredited laboratory group (later announced as Omni) to launch the Company's CIZ1B biomarker test throughout the USA. As part of agreed advance exclusivity and royalty fees, BIO paid an early payment of US$125,000 to the Company bringing total receipts at that date of US$525,000 of the guaranteed advance payments of US$2.4m. The Company and BIO have now agreed to a new regular payment schedule that will result in all remaining advance royalties being received by the end of 2026.\nFinancial overview\nDuring the six months ended 30 June 2025, the Company continued its focus on being a healthcare diagnostics developer. The Group consists of Cizzle Biotechnology Holdings PLC as the parent company with wholly owned subsidiaries, Cizzle Biotechnology Ltd (\"CBL\") and Cizzle Biotech Ltd (formerly Enfis Ltd).

Today, the Company announced that it has entered into a Letter of Intent (\"LOI\") with a leading medical diagnostic services provider (the \"Provider\") acting in partnership with the NHS as result of that initiative.\nThe Additional Notes will be issued as an extension to the Company's existing unsecured convertible loan notes of \u00a3150,000 (\"Original Notes\") issued to Frazer Lang (the \"Note Holder\"), on 18 May 2025.\nThe\nCompany may issue the Additional Notes at \u00a350,000 per month and any funds received will be used in connection with the Company's focus on commercialising its CIZ1B biomarker test in North America and the UK. Any\nAdditional Notes issued are convertible at any time up to 31 March 2026, at the election of the Note Holder, into new ordinary shares of 0.01p in the Company (\"Ordinary Shares\") at a price of 1.4 pence per ordinary share.

The LOI covers the\nverification and validation of the Company's CIZ1B biomarker test with a NHS Foundation Trust partner\nin state-of-the-art laboratories\nwhich may lead to the Provider being appointed as the Company's exclusive UK supplier of the CIZ1B test.\nThe discovery and development of the CIZ1B biomarker test is the result of many years of pioneering work by Professor Dawn Coverley, the Company's founder and CSO, and her research team at the University of York. Initially supported by Yorkshire Cancer Research it has always been the ambition to ensure patients and healthcare professionals in the NHS and elsewhere should benefit from the Company's work in early cancer detection as part of its commercial roll out plans.\nAs part of the Company's commercial strategy to licence its proprietary test for the CIZ1B biomarker for use in the early detection of lung cancer globally, it has already secured a licence agreement in North America and the Caribbean, with guaranteed royalties and up-front fees of US$2.4 million, of which US$530,000 has already been received.\nOn 20 May 2025, the Company secured funding of \u00a3150,000 through the issue of convertible loan notes from the Company's existing shareholder, Frazer Lang\nto provide additional funding\nto support the Company's growth strategy, in particular to roll out its CIZ1B early cancer test\nin the UK and elsewhere in Europe. The intended partnership with the Provider, which for commercial reasons is confidential at this time, is a result of that programme.\nHaving established a route to market in North America and the Caribbean, the Company was keen to ensure that patients in the UK and then elsewhere in Europe, will also benefit from how the CIZ1B biomarker test can help in early lung cancer detection. This aligns with the current NHS cancer plan to improve cancer survival by increasing the proportion of cancers diagnosed at stages 1 and 2 with an aim to save 55,000 lives per year by 2028. A key element of this is improving access to early diagnosis, and increasing the number of cancers identified through screening.\nUnder the terms of the LOI,\nthe Provider will immediately carry out a validation exercise with the Company and provide clinical input for the intended clinical indication of CIZ1B. Cizzle will provide on-site technical support under the guidance of Professor Coverley to confirm assay performance data. Following agreed success criteria, the parties will negotiate a Partnership Agreement for the commercialisation of the CIZ1B test. The Provider may then be appointed as the exclusive UK supplier of the CIZ1B test (subject to regulatory frameworks, including CE/UKCA/HIE requirements) and together, Cizzle and the Provider will jointly develop a go-to-market strategy, including co-branding and aligned communications. A commercial distribution model based on revenue share or a licensing structure, with a rollout strategy beyond the UK into Europe across private and NHS markets, will be negotiated.\nThe Company will also continue to focus on\nsupporting its US partner Cizzle BIO Inc, to secure CLIA accreditation to take the test live in the near term, and on completing the ongoing Moffitt study to t\nest patients with suspicious lung nodules in a clinical evaluation, as announced on 9 September 2024.\nCommenting, Allan Syms, Executive Chairman of Cizzle Biotechnology, said:\n\"We announced in May 2025 that while continuing to support the Company's licensing partner in North America, we would now be seeking an additional licensing partnership in the UK and rest of Europe. We are excited to report we have now entered a LOI with a leading UK provider\nwith partnerships with NHS Foundation Trusts. Our goal is to provide a first-class service to help drive early cancer detection at scale globally.\nWe are now pleased that t\nhe UK will be the next phase\nof our growth plans in making the test available to many patients as soon as possible.\nEnquiries:\nCizzle Biotechnology Holdings plc\nVia IFC Advisory\nAllan Syms (Executive Chairman)\nAllenby Capital Limited\n+44(0) 20 3328 5656\nJohn Depasquale / Piers Shimwell (Corporate Finance)\nAmrit Nahal (Sales and Corporate Broking)\nIFC Advisory Limited\n+44(0) 20 3934 6630\nTim Metcalfe\nF",

It specialises in a comprehensive range of testing services, including pharmacogenomics, molecular diagnostics, clinical testing, genetic testing, and diagnostics for medical fields such as cardiology, oncology, neurology, and infectious diseases. Omni focuses on delivering precise, accurate, and reliable results to support healthcare providers and patients and has an active expansion programme to acquire or partner with other accredited laboratories throughout the USA including New York, California, South Carolina, Tennessee and Florida to enable a nationwide testing capability. While initially to be offered as a private pay for test, they intend to secure CPT (Current Procedural Terminology) codes to allow payment by Medicare and Medicaid. BIO and Omni will engage in a progressive marketing campaign, working closely with patient advocacy groups to enable easy patient engagement and so\nr\neduce premature cancer deaths and improve survival rates and quality of life for cancer patients.\nAdvance Royalty Agreement with BIO\nOn 18 August 2025, the Company announced that it had received initial payments totalling US$525,000 from its exclusive licensing agreement with BIO as part of a guaranteed payment schedule due to the Company totalling US$2.4 million to be paid in full before the end of 2026.

Alongside this, BIO and the Company have agreed to a revised regular payment schedule that will result in the remaining advance royalties due to the Company being paid by the end of 2026, ahead of the previously agreed schedule, being end of April 2027.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nBIO has entered into a new agreement with multi-site full scale COLA and CLIA accredited laboratory group to launch the Company's CIZ1B biomarker test throughout the USA.\n\u00b7\nAs part of agreed advance exclusivity and royalty fees, BIO paid an early payment of US$125,000 to the Company bringing total receipts to date of US$525,000 of the guaranteed advance payments of US$2.4m. The Company and BIO have now agreed to a new regular payment schedule that will result in all remaining advance royalties being received by the end of 2026.\nBIO new agreement to\nlaunch the Company's CIZ1B biomarker test throughout the USA\nOn 21 October 2024, the Company\nannounced an exclusive licensing and partnership agreement\nwith BIO to market\nits proprietary CIZ1B biomarker test to help detect early-stage lung cancer, throughout the USA and Canada as a Laboratory Developed Test (\"LDT\") in Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (\"CLIA\") accredited laboratories. The Company extended the territory; to cover\nthe 14 Sovereign States of the Caribbean and the Cayman Islands (\"Caribbean\")\non 16 December 2024 and at the same time announced they had executed an agreement with\na\nCommission on Office Laboratory Accreditation (\"COLA\") accredited\nlaboratory partner to validate and register the CIZ1B biomarker as a CLIA LDT.\nOn 24 March 2025, the Company announced that\niGenomeDX had been establishing operating and quality systems with a target of offering the test to clinicians in\nApril 2025. At the time, BIO's strategy was to then complete further contracts with other laboratory partners to roll out the test more widely once\niGenomeDX had completed their work\n.\nHowever, following the progress made by\niGenomeDX as the\npathfinder clinical laboratory, BIO's strategy has developed to more appropriately reflect the large market opportunity they are seeing for the Company's CIZ1B biomarker test in North America. They have therefore realigned their accreditation and market launch strategy to the new multi-site clinical laboratory, enabling a much wider co-ordinated and comprehensive campaign to roll out the CIZ1B biomarker test in North America to help detect early-stage lung cancer. This new agreement with a significantly larger multi-site clinical laboratory demonstrates how BIO intends to scale its operations throughout the USA.\nThe new multi-site laboratory capability is designed to ensure operational and quality systems can deliver expected reproducibility and sensitivity in a cost-effective and scalable version of the CIZ1B biomarker assay. This will now meet BIO's demand for commercial sales at scale and thereby achieve the goal of\nr\neducing premature cancer deaths and improving survival rates and quality of life for cancer patients.\nAdvance Royalty Agreement with BIO\nThe Company has now received payments totalling US$525,000 from BIO for initial exclusivity fees and advanced royalties as part of guaranteed payments due to the Company totalling US$2.4 million over the period ending April 2027.\nBIO made a payment of US$125,000 in early July 2025 ahead of the planned advance royalty schedule. Going forward, the Company and BIO have agreed a revised regular payment schedule that will result in the remaining US$1,875,000 guaranteed advance royalties due to the Company being paid by the end of 2026, instead of the end of April 2027. The new regular payment schedule reflects the cash flow requirements of both companies during that period.\nCommenting, Allan Syms, Executive Chairman of Cizzle Biotechnology, said:\n\"I am pleased to announce further progress being made by our partner BIO. Following the progress made by their pathfinder clinical laboratory, BIO's strategy has developed to more appropriately reflect the large market opportunity they are seeing for the Company's\nCIZ1B biomarker tes",

No interest is payable on the Note.\nBackground\nThe Company's commercial strategy is to licence globally its proprietary test for the CIZ1B biomarker for use in the early detection of lung cancer. Having secured the Company's first licence agreement with BIO for North America and the Caribbean, BIO has already established partnerships with specialist clinical laboratories and hospitals to enable market penetration and make the test available to as many clinicians and patients as possible. The agreement with BIO provides the Company with guaranteed royalties and up-front fees of US$2.4 million, of which US$400,000 has already been received, as well as a future equity stake in BIO. The next payment of US$250,000 is expected at the end of July 2025 as a result of securing BIO's first hospital contract in the Caribbean.\nThe discovery and development of the CIZ1B biomarker test is the result of many years of pioneering work by Professor Dawn Coverley, the Company's founder and CSO, and her research team at the University of York. Initially supported by various UK research grants it has always been the ambition to ensure patients and healthcare professionals in the NHS and elsewhere should benefit from the Company's work in early cancer detection as part of its commercial roll out plans.\nThe current NHS cancer plan aims to dramatically improve cancer survival by increasing the proportion of cancers diagnosed at stages 1 and 2 from half to three-quarters by 2028. This shift towards earlier diagnosis is expected to save 55,000 additional lives per year by 2028. The plan focuses on improving access to diagnosis and treatment, raising awareness of cancer symptoms, and increasing the number of cancers identified through screening, including personalised and risk-stratified approaches.\nThe Company's focus is to appoint further accredited facilities globally, with the focus now on the UK and Europe, to launch the\ncommercially scalable\nCIZ1B biomarker test\nto help r\neduce premature cancer deaths and improve survival rates and quality of life for cancer patients.\nCommenting, Allan Syms, Executive Chairman of Cizzle Biotechnology, said:\n\"Following the success of the Company's licensing strategy in North America, we are now keen to build partnerships in the UK and elsewhere in Europe. The CIZ1B biomarker and its use in early cancer diagnosis was the result of many years of research and development by Professor Coverley, the Founder and CSO of the Company, and her research team at the University of York, and we want to ensure this innovation also brings benefit to patients in the UK delivered through the NHS and other healthcare providers. The new funding provided by Frazer Lang, a long standing and supportive shareholder, will now allow us to bring forward our plans to make the test available to patients in the UK.\"\nCommenting, Frazer Lang said:\n\"\nAs a dedicated supporter of the Company's mission to reduce lung cancer's impact through early detection with a simple, cost-effective blood test, I'm proud to provide additional funding to accelerate our efforts to benefit UK patients. This investment builds on my family's existing stake, increasing our shareholding to 12.87% once the Note is converted. We are wholeheartedly committed to the Company's success and to saving lives.\n\"\nEnquiries:\nCizzle Biotechnology Holdings plc\nVia IFC Advisory\nAllan Syms (Executive Chairman)\nAllenby Capital Limited\n+44(0) 20 3328 5656\nJohn Depasquale / Piers Shimwell (Corporate Finance)\nStefano Aquilino / Amrit Nahal (Sales and Corporate Broking)\nIFC Advisory Limited\n+44(0) 20 3934 6630\nTim Metcalfe\nFlorence Chandler\nAbout Cizzle Biotechnology\nBased on the pioneering work of Professor Coverley and colleagues, on\u00a0a naturally occurring variant of the cell nuclear protein CIZ1, the CIZ1B biomarker is highly associated with the presence of early-stage cance",

The non-exclusive Laboratory Services Agreement signed by BIO with Doctors Hospital (\nChrissie Tomlinson Memorial Hospital - CTMH)\nin the Cayman Islands triggers the\nearly royalty payments due to the Company from BIO, totalling US$500,000 in July and September 2025, as part of the advanced minimum royalty of US$1 million previously all due on 21 January 2026.\nIn addition to this further clinical laboratory appointment, BIO is making progress in expanding its network across the USA. Its accreditation and launch plans are now being synchronised to enable a more co-ordinated and comprehensive campaign to\nroll out\nthe CIZ1B biomarker test to help detect early-stage lung cancer.\nCizzle\u00a0Bio's initial target was to complete CLIA accreditation and secure the first commercial sale of the CIZ1B biomarker test by the end of April 2025. As a consequence of this broader campaign, the launch date has been slightly extended and is now expected to be finalised\u00a0in the near term.\nKey Highlights\n\u00b7\nCizzle Bio appoints first clinical diagnostics laboratory to offer commercial CIZ1B biomarker testing in the Caribbean triggering\nearly payments totalling US$250,000 in July 2025 and US$250,000 in September 2025.\n\u00b7\nThe expansion of BIO's laboratory network follows the ongoing and successful collaboration between BIO and the Company to ensure the CIZ1B test for use in helping detect early-stage lung cancer meets the exacting standards\nas a laboratory developed test for commercial use\n. It is expected that further sites and commercial launch plans will be announced shortly.\nBackground\nOn 21 October 2024 the Company\nannounced an exclusive licensing and partnership agreement\nwith BIO\nfor its proprietary CIZ1B biomarker test to help detect early-stage lung cancer, throughout the USA and Canada. The Company has since received payments of US$400,000 from initial exclusivity fees and advanced royalties as part of guaranteed payments totalling US$2.4 million over the period ending April 2027. The Company extended that agreement on 16 December 2024 to cover\nthe 14 Sovereign States of the Caribbean and the Cayman Islands (\"Caribbean\") and the signing of BIO's first contract in the Cayman Islands triggers early payments totalling US$250,000 in July 2025 and US$250,000 in September 2025.\nBIO's commercial strategy is to work with a number of specialist clinical laboratories to maximise market penetration and make the CIZ1B biomarker test available to as many clinicians and patients as possible. The appointment of accredited facilities to launch the CIZ1B biomarker test\ninvolves evaluation of a laboratory's operations, including its testing procedures, quality control, personnel qualifications, and compliance with regulatory requirements.\nThe successful completion of the operational and quality systems programme is required for launching a cost-effective and scalable version of the CIZ1B biomarker that is commercially scalable and can be rolled out as a global solution\nto help r\neduce premature cancer deaths and improve survival rates and quality of life for cancer patients.\nCommenting, Allan Syms, Executive Chairman of Cizzle Biotechnology, said:\n\"The launch programme for our CIZ1B biomarker test to help in the early diagnosis of lung cancer by our licensing partner in North America and the Caribbean continues to progress at pace and I am delighted to announce its success in appointing a further clinical laboratory as part of its strategy to build a network of accredited laboratories to make our innovative cancer test available to as many clinicians and patients as possible.\nAs part of the Company's global licensing strategy to deliver shareholder value through royalty payments and potential benefits arising from equity participation in the partner companies where possible,\nby securing its first contract in the Caribbean, this also facilitates early royalty payments generating early revenues to the Company. We look forward to sharing updates on the expansion of sites and reporting on the success of the first commercially available tests in the near future.\"\nEnquiries:\nCizzle Biotechnology Holdings plc\nV",

Her new role is an executive role on the Company's board and replaces her current position as an NED.\n\u00b7\nSuccessful completion of a technical programme to launch the most cost-effective and scalable version of the CIZ1B biomarker assay as an ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) for CLIA accreditation.\nThe change in role from NED to CSO, enables Dawn to allocate more of her expert time to directly support the Company's licensing partners, particularly in the USA, to support Cizzle Bio Inc's CAP (College of American Pathologists) accredited laboratory partners, helping them to achieve CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments) LDT (Laboratory Developed Test) accreditation and identify and lead new non-dilutive grant funded research and clinical evaluations.\nDawn is currently a professor and principal investigator of a research laboratory at the University of York, studying how specialised cells are protected from age-related decay. After a first degree in Genetics (Leicester), and a PhD in Biochemistry (Cancer Research UK), she completed postdoctoral training at the University of Cambridge, then moved to the University of York to establish an independent research group in 2002, supported by the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine.\nDawn will reduce a number of her current teaching and scientific roles at the University of York in order to devote sufficient time to the Company's activities, whilst maintaining a number of key roles, including leadership of her research group and management of the Company's existing research and development contract at the University of York.\nThe timing of this appointment coincides with the successful completion of the technical programme which confirms that the most cost-effective and scalable version of the CIZ1B biomarker assay for CLIA accreditation is an ELISA. The rigorous quality control programme undertaken has been able to demonstrate equivalence with initial manual laboratory tests and with the BioTechne ProteinSimple capillary Western system. Results have shown sensitivity equivalent to published CIZ1B lung cancer studies *, and an ability to correctly identify people with lung cancer with few false negative results. This is another major step in demonstrating that the Company's lung cancer blood test is both cost effective and a commercially scalable global solution\nto r\neduce premature cancer deaths and improve survival rates and quality of life for cancer patients.\nCommenting, Allan Syms, Executive Chairman of Cizzle Biotechnology, said:\n\"I am delighted that Dawn will be able to allocate more of her time to directly support the Company as we progress through the commercial phase and the test is rolled out to partner laboratories. As the founder of Cizzle and the world expert on the CIZ1 gene and our CIZ1B variant biomarker, Dawn will be able to take a greater role in the direction and implementation of our entire research and development programme, managing Cizzle's participation in clinical evaluations with cancer centres across the globe and directly supporting the Company's licensing partners' route to market.

This is the critical first step in the Company's global licensing and partnership strategy to bring Cizzle's non-invasive, cost effective CIZ1B biomarker lung cancer blood test to market next year.\nExecution of the Agreement follows the Company entering into a Memorandum of Understanding (\"MOU\") on 2 April 2024 with an independently funded USA based\ncorporation, Cizzle Bio Inc (\"BIO\"). The Agreement meets an important planned milestone in the Company's licensing and partnership strategy to launch the CIZ1B biomarker test in North America, one of world's largest markets.\nBIO brings a US based, highly experienced management team with extensive clinical expertise, who are incentivised through fixed milestone payments to accelerate the deployment of the test into the North American market. The Agreement aligns both parties' strategic goals through a royalty payment structure, including an initial payment to the Company of US$300,000 and equity participation where the Company can share in any future value of BIO.\nKey Highlights\n\u00b7\nExclusive North American License\n: The agreement grants BIO exclusive rights to the CIZ1B biomarker technology for early lung cancer detection in North America.\n\u00b7\nInitial Payment\n: Cizzle has received an upfront royalty payment of US$300,000 as part of a 10% royalty on gross sales after tax, with guaranteed minimum royalty payments totalling US$2 million over the next 30 months.\n\u00b7\nBIO's Funding\n: BIO will cover all costs for clinical evaluations, accreditation, and marketing of CIZ1B diagnostic tests in North America.\n\u00b7\nEquity Stake\n: Cizzle is entitled to receive capital stock in BIO pursuant to a simple agreement for future equity (\"SAFE\"), for no cash consideration, or a non-diluted cash bonus on a sale of BIO.\n\u00b7\nGlobal Benefits\n: Cizzle retains rights to improvements and evidence of CIZ1B utility, to support sales in the rest of the world.\n\u00b7\nRevenue Streams for Growth:\nCizzle now has established revenue streams, positioning the Company to pursue its next strategic milestones. This includes expanding into new regions and advancing the development of a point-of-care (\"POC\") test.\n\u00b7\nValue-Creating Partnership:\nThe Agreement aligns the interests of both parties to create long-term value, ensuring Cizzle shares in BIO's success as they expand.\n\u00b7\nCollaboration with Moffitt Cancer Center\n: BIO has already secured partnerships with leading US cancer centres, resulting in the Company announcing a collaboration with the Moffitt Cancer Center, the top cancer facility in Florida and the Southeast US.\n\u00b7\nUpcoming Laboratory Contract\n: BIO expects to announce its first clinical lab contract soon.\n\u00b7\nAccreditation and Launch Timeline\n: BIO aims to achieve CLIA accreditation for the CIZ1B biomarker test before the end of 2024, with a full market launch with approved reimbursement codes planned for April 2025.\nThe management team of BIO have already made significant progress in establishing relationships with clinicians, hospitals and US cancer centres of excellence which resulted in the Company announcing on 9 September 2024 a major clinical evaluation with the Moffitt Cancer Center, the number one cancer centre in the South East USA. This is a significant development because the project will be carried out in the real-world setting of a busy comprehensive cancer centre with a large lung cancer practice and a high volume, well-organised clinical thoracic research programme. While the blood sample tests for the Moffitt study will be conducted in Cizzle Biotechnology founder, Professor Dawn Coverley's, laboratory at the University of York, it is envisaged that future clinical evaluations in the USA will be conducted in BIO's planned network of CAP and CLIA accredited laboratories.\nThe\nMoffitt study highlights that of\nthe low number of lung cancer patients surviving long term, most are early-stage patients who had surgical resection. Unfortunately, with current screening using low dose chest CT scans (\"LDCT\"), only 17%* are found with localised, potentially curable disease. Although LDCT is an effective tool in high-risk populations, only 3.9%* of eligible people obtain a scan. Mof",

These funds will be used by the Group to finalise its first commercial test for detecting CIZ1B, to strengthen its intellectual property, advance its research with the University of York, and support general corporate activities.\n\u00b7\nNorth America Partnership\n: On 2 April 2024, the Group entered into a Strategic Licencing and Partnership Memorandum of Understanding for North America with Cizzle Bio Inc. (\"BIO\"). Its proprietary CIZ1B biomarker test has subsequently been selected for a major study at a leading US cancer centre. Cizzle received an up-front payment of US$100,000 as a non-refundable fee to grant BIO an exclusive negotiating period from the signing of a memorandum of understanding on 1 April 2024 (\"MoU\").\n\u00b7\nResearch Agreement Extension\n: The Group's research agreement with the University of York was extended until July 2025.\n\u00b7\nFinancial results\n: Loss for the period of \u00a31,411,000 (H1 2023: Loss \u00a3457,000), includes a \u00a31,081,000 (H1 2023: \u00a3Nil) fair value loss on a financial asset. This being a non-cash item, the Group's net cash used in operating activities (which excludes proceeds from the issue of ordinary shares) was \u00a3238,000 (H1 2023: \u00a3327,000).\nPost Period Highlights\n\u00b7\nPartnership with BBI Solutions\n: In July 2024 the Group announced a strategic agreement with BBI Solutions, the world's largest independent producer of immunodiagnostic reagents, for the supply of monoclonal antibodies. This partnership is a significant step toward commercialising Cizzle's cost-effective biomarker test for early-stage lung cancer detection.\n\u00b7\nUpdate on Strategic Licensing Partnership in North America\n: On 25 July 2024, Cizzle agreed a 60-day extension with BIO for the completion of the binding legal agreement as envisaged under the MoU, to enable BIO to complete on additional strategic investment.\n\u00b7\nMoffitt Cancer Center Collaboration\n: On 9 September 2024, the Group was selected by Moffitt Cancer Center (\"Moffitt\"), Florida's leading cancer hospital, to test patients with suspicious lung nodules in a clinical evaluation using the Group's proprietary CIZ1B biomarker assay. This will be the first time that suspected lung cancer patients will be tested for the CIZ1B Biomarker as part of a major clinical evaluation.\nCommenting Allan Syms, Chairman of Cizzle Biotechnology, said:\n\"Throughout 2024, the Group has made significant progress in developing its blood test to help in the early detection of lung cancer through (i) the manufacturing of its core antibodies with BBI Solutions in their\nISO 13485-certified facilities\n; (ii) the industrial collaboration with an industry leading laboratory instrumentation partner; and (iii) being selected by the number one cancer centre in Florida to conduct a clinical evaluation of our biomarker for their patients presenting with suspicious lung nodules. Furthermore, the establishment of a partnership with BIO has now moved the business into the commercial phase of bringing our non-invasive, cost effective CIZ1B biomarker lung cancer blood test to market. Not only does this mark the achievement of our planned major milestones targeting full product launch in April 2025, but also makes our goal of helping detect lung cancer early and thereby proving a valuable new means for early intervention and ultimately helping save lives. The partnership with BIO is expected to be completed shortly giving us the potential for a significant guaranteed royalty deal in North America.\"\nExecutive Chairman's Statement\nOperational and strategic overview\nCizzle has focussed on the systematic development and commercialisation of novel and proprietary clinical diagnostic tests for the early detection of cancer particularly where there is an unmet clinical need. It is widely considered that to beat cancer,\u202fearly detection and diagnosis\u202fis\u202farguably\u202fthe single most important and impactful objective we can have.\u202fPatients diagnosed early have the best chance of curative treatment and long-term survival reducing patient stress and improving healthcare economic performance.\nThe Group's platform technology is based on the ability to detect a stable plasma biomarker, a variant of CIZ1 known as CIZ1B. CIZ1 is a naturally occurring cell nuclear protein involved in DNA replication, and the targeted CIZ1B variant is highly correlated with early-stage lung cancer.

They have developed a comprehensive lung cancer screening programme that is among the best in the United States, which has resulted in them being named a Screening Center of Excellence by the\nGO2 Foundation for Lung Cancer.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nCollaboration with Moffitt Cancer Center, a leading dedicated cancer centre in the USA\n\u00b7\nFirst time suspected lung cancer patients will be tested for the CIZ1B Biomarker as part of a major clinical evaluation\n\u00b7\nStudy follows US national guidelines\n\u00b7\nCizzle selected after scientific review by Moffitt and as a result of the Company's partnership in the USA with Cizzle Bio Inc\n\u00b7\nFirst use of new monoclonal antibodies to be delivered shortly by Cizzle's strategic commercial manufacturing partner, BBI Solutions\n\u00b7\nBlood samples from US patients will be analysed at the University of York\n\u00b7\nMore clinical collaborations planned by Cizzle BIO in the USA\n\u00b7\nWill help validate use of CIZ1B for early lung cancer detection\nAs part of Moffitt's Phase 2 programme, \"Using Biomarkers for Diagnosis, Risk Stratification of Post-treatment Recurrence and Long Term Survival of Lung Cancer\",\na large observational prospective study in patients with suspicious indeterminant (undiagnosed) lung nodules seen in the Lung Cancer Early Detection (LEAD) Center Lung Nodule Clinic, led by its Director Dr. Lary Robinson, the Company will for the first time be analyzing patient blood samples to determine biomarker accuracy in predicting whether or not a nodule is likely to be cancer. The study follows US nationally recommended guidelines and will be using the first batch of the Company's new commercial monoclonal antibody, to provide new sensitivity and specificity data of the CIZ1B biomarker blood test in the diagnosis of early-stage lung cancer in people with indeterminant lung nodules. The blood sample tests for CIZ1B will be conducted in Professor Dawn Coverley's laboratory at the University of York.\nThe collaboration with Moffitt arises from the progress being made, and extensive network being generated, by the Company's US licensing partner Cizzle Bio Inc (\"BIO\"). The Company expects to shortly complete its formal licensing agreement with BIO following the signing of a MOU with them on 2 April 2024, which was extended until 30 September 2024. Since signing the MOU, BIO have been establishing clinical partnerships across the USA as part of a planned expansion to make the CIZ1B biomarker test available throughout North America. BIO expect to announce further clinical evaluations with additional major cancer centers and clinics this year, to be conducted in their growing network of\nlaboratories accredited by the College of American Pathology Pathologists (CAP) with\nClinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certification\n. On signing of the full agreement with BIO a further US$300,000 advance royalty fee will be paid to the Company.\nFurther Information\nMore people die from lung cancer than any other cancer, and every day nearly 5000 people lose the battle to survive. This is due, in large part, to the unmet clinical need for a simple blood test that can detect lung cancer at an early-stage. While both the USA and UK are rolling out screening programmes based on low dose CT scanning, uptake has been poor and still too many people present with suspicious lung nodules that are not cancer, leading to unnecessary stress, avoidable radiation, high costs and consumption of valuable clinician time. The identification of the CIZ1B biomarker and its association with early-stage lung cancer offers an opportunity to add a valuable tool in the clinician's armoury to improved cancer detection rates and ultimately save lives. The Company remains focused on bringing its proprietary test forCIZ1B to market at the earliest opportunity. Bringing the test initially to the USA provides an important platform to then enter new markets and meet the demand for a cost-effective biomarker test globally.\nAllan Syms, Executive Chairman of Cizzle Biotechnology, said:\n\"Today's announcement of the collaboration with the Moffitt Cancer Center marks a major inflection point in the Compan",

BIO has already attracted significant interest within the clinical sector for the CIZ1B biomarker, generating a valuable pipeline of potential customers.\nBIO has been successful with its initial investment round and has requested a 60-day extension to the completion of the binding legal agreement with Cizzle, as envisaged under the MoU, to enable BIO to complete on additional strategic investment that has been proposed. As Cizzle will be granted a 10% stake in BIO, for no cash consideration on closing, the Cizzle Directors believe that allowing for the extension will increase the value of the Company's stake in BIO and with access to greater funds BIO will be able to accelerate the deployment of its go to market strategy for the Company's CIZ1B biomarker test. Cizzle has therefore agreed to the 60-day extension. There are no other amendments to the terms of the MoU, detailed in the announcement on 2 April 2024, or amendments to BIO's planned timetable of key milestones for bringing the Company's CIZ1B biomarker test to market, as outlined in the Company's announcement on 17 June 2024.\nFurther announcements will be made in due course as matters progress.\nEnquiries:\nCizzle Biotechnology Holdings plc\nVia IFC Advisory\nAllan Syms (Executive Chairman)\nAllenby Capital Limited\n+44(0) 20 3328 5656\nJohn Depasquale\nGeorge Payne\nNovum Securities Limited\n+44(0) 20 7399 9400\nColin Rowbury\nJon Bellis\nIFC Advisory Limited\n+44(0) 20 3934 6630\nTim Metcalfe\nFlorence Chandler\nAbout Cizzle Biotechnology\nCizzle is developing a blood test for the early detection of lung cancer. The Company is a spin- out from the University of York, founded in 2006, around the work of Professor Coverley and colleagues. Its proof-of-concept prototype test is based on the ability to detect a stable plasma biomarker, a variant of CIZ1 known as CIZ1B. CIZ1 is a naturally occurring cell nuclear protein involved in DNA replication, and the targeted CIZ1B variant is highly correlated with early-stage lung cancer. For more information, please see\nhttps://cizzlebiotechnology.com\nYou can also follow the Company through its twitter account @CizzlePlc and on LinkedIn.\nAbout Cizzle Bio Inc\nCizzle Bio Inc, a company registered in Texas USA, has been created by a group of high-net-worth individuals with a passion to improve cancer patient survival. Recognising that one of the main causes of poor survival rates for certain cancers, and in particular lung cancer, is because diagnosis is often when the disease is at an advanced state, there is an unmet need for a simple blood test that can be used to detect cancer early. BIO is led by Bill Behnke, who has been pioneering Cizzle Biotechnology's marketing activities in the USA and is\nan accomplished entrepreneur and performance-driven senior executive with an extensive background of success in funding and building healthcare businesses through direct sales, marketing, sales management, and business development. He is heavily engaged in charitable work for cancer, and served a nine-year tenure on the national board of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. He currently serves on the boards of the ASCO Foundation's Conquer Cancer; the AYA Cancer Foundation; The Wheeler Group; Children's Shelter of San Antonio; South Texas Blood and Tissue Center; and the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

This collaboration is a significant milestone in Cizzle's mission to commercialise its cost-effective biomarker test for early-stage lung cancer detection.\nThis initial order of CIZ1B commercial propriety monoclonal antibodies from BBI is crucial for advancing the clinical evaluation process, marking a vital step towards bringing the test to market. These antibodies will be manufactured at BBI's ISO 13485-certified facilities and are expected to support up to 5000 assays for detecting the CIZ1B biomarker, which is strongly associated with early-stage lung cancer.\nThe antibodies produced will be used in a clinical evaluation of patients with suspicious indeterminant (undiagnosed) lung nodules for lung cancer with a major cancer centre in the USA. This evaluation is ahead of the planned rollout of commercial tests by the Company's intended licensing partner in the USA, Cizzle Bio Inc (\"BIO\"). Additionally, this partnership supports the development of a point of care (\"POC\") assay and the Company's broader plans to explore the utility of CIZ1B for detecting other cancers.\nKey Highlights:\n\u00b7\nPartnership with BBI Solutions: BBI will manufacture commercial CIZ1B monoclonal antibodies.\n\u00b7\nCertified Manufacturing: Production in ISO 13485-certified facilities ensures adherence to stringent quality standards.\n\u00b7\nSufficient Initial Supply: The first batch will support up to 5000 blood tests for the CIZ1B biomarker.\n\u00b7\nSupporting Clinical Evaluation: The antibodies will facilitate clinical evaluations with a major US cancer centre, critical for confirming the presence of lung cancer in patients with indeterminate lung nodules identified by CT scans.\nCommercialization and Regulatory Strategy\nThe antibodies being produced will support Cizzle's ongoing commercialisation and regulatory strategy, including:\n\u00b7\nUS CLIA accreditation: As announced on 17 June 2024, BIO aims to register its first US CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments) accredited lab with the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) for the CIZ1B LDT test in September 2024.\n\u00b7\nCLIA certification and product launch: BIO plan to achieve CLIA certification for the LDT in November 2024, with an anticipated product launch and insurer reimbursement code achievement by April 2025.\n\u00b7\nPoint of Care (\"POC\") development: Plans include developing a POC test for use in pharmacies, doctors' offices, and by healthcare providers.\n\u00b7\nExpanded research: Continued R&D at the University of York to explore the utility of CIZ1B in detecting other cancers.\nIt is essential that reagents, including the Company's monoclonal antibodies, meet strict regulatory requirements. The ISO standards (International Organization for Standardization)\nprovide a platform to\nbring globally accepted standards together\nand in the case of medical devices, which includes in vitro diagnostics, ISO 13485 is the Quality Management System applicable to the regulatory requirements for a business operating in the medical device sector*. BBI will be producing the Company's antibodies within their ISO13485 certified facilities for custom manufacture of antibodies.\n*\nPUB100422_preview.pdf (iso.org)\nFurther Information\nWith nearly 5000 lives lost daily to lung cancer, largely due to the lack of a simple early detection test, Cizzle is dedicated to bringing its proprietary CIZ1B test to market as quickly as possible. This partnership with BBI is a pivotal step in providing reliable clinical results and developing a user-friendly point-of-care test.\nThe supply of the new commercial monoclonal antibodies will be used to provide clinical results on patients suspected to have early-stage lung cancer arising from CT scanning in the US cancer centre, developing a simple finger prick point of care test for the CIZ1B biomarker and continuing Cizzle's work to determine the utility of the test for other cancers.\nIn addition, the Company's ongoing assay development and clinical evaluations are supported by Cizzle's renewed research and development contract with the University of York, announced on 17 June 2024. Subject to local ethical approvals, the new phase of work will provide clinical results on patients with suspected early-stage lung cancer arising from CT scanning at a leading US cancer centre.\nAllan Syms, Executive Chairman of Cizzle Biotechnology, said:\n\"We are making significant progress in bringing the company's CIZ1B test to marke",

The Agreement will provide resources, for an initial period of six months, to support the Board in the areas of strategy, partnerships, licensing and shareholder communications, as the Company considers its further global expansion.\nPursuant to the Agreement, Makabo has agreed to waive payment of more than 85 per cent. of its entitled fees and link remuneration directly to the success of the Company, and Makabo delivering enhanced shareholder value, by accepting share options over new Ordinary Shares (the \"\nOptions\n\"). Accordingly, Makabo will be issued with 2,464,625 Options in aggregate over the initial six months of the Agreement, with the Options having an exercise price of 1.622965p per ordinary share, being the volume weighted average price (\"\nVWAP\"\n) of the Ordinary Shares for the month of June 2024. The Options will be granted on a pro-rata monthly basis and will all vest and become exercisable on 25 June 2025 assuming that the VWAP of the Ordinary Shares for the period 25 May 2025 to 24 June 2025 is equal or greater than 3.24593p, being twice or greater than the Options grant price. The Options will be then remain exercisable until 25 June 2027.\nThe Options have been granted outside of, and in addition to, grants made under the Company's existing share option schemes. Following the grant of the Options, the total number of Ordinary Shares under option is 51,150,068, representing 12.9% of the Company's issued share capital.\nAllan Syms, Executive Chairman of Cizzle Biotechnology, said:\n\"\nCizzle operates a very lean structure and I believe having further diverse input and support for the Cizzle Board at this inflection point, from an adviser whose remuneration is directly aligned with shareholders' interests, is key to maximising value for all stakeholders. Ensuring we have the right resources to realise the opportunities ahead is key to the success of our business and the generation of shareholder value. This is an exciting time for the Company as we aim to transform our business from a research and development focused company to one with revenue generating products available in the market to facilitate early cancer detection. We look forward to working closely with Makabo over the coming months to develop and deliver on our key strategic goals\n.\"\nEnquiries:\nCizzle Biotechnology Holdings plc\nAllan Syms (Executive Chairman)\nVia IFC Advisory\nAllenby Capital Limited\nJohn Depasquale/George Payne (Corporate Finance)\nStefano Aquilino/Amrit Nahal (Sales and Corporate Broking)\n+44(0) 20 3328 5656\nNovum Securities Limited\nColin Rowbury / Jon Bellis\n+44(0) 20 7399 9400\nIFC Advisory Limited\nTim Metcalfe / Florence Chandler\n+44(0) 20 3934 6630\nAbout Cizzle Biotechnology\nCizzle is developing a blood test for the early detection of lung cancer.

The new research agreement with the University of York will run until July 2025.\nFollowing the Company's signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (\"MoU\") with BIO, as announced on 2 April 2024, the Company received the initial non-refundable upfront fee of US$100,000 and expects a binding legal agreement to be completed within the envisaged 120 day period from signing the MoU, with a further US$300,000 payment to Cizzle on signing the binding agreement. The Company has been working closely with BIO's US management team to determine a timetable with key milestones for bringing the company's CIZ1B biomarker test to market. Further details on BIO's plans are outlined below. Details of the first hospital locations, clinical trials and initial deployment sites are confidential at this time, but will be announced in due course.\nKey Highlights\n\u2022\nCizzle received an up-front payment of US$100,000 as a non-refundable fee to grant BIO an exclusive negotiating period of 120 days from the signing of the MoU on 1 April 2024.\n\u2022\nIt is anticipated that the binding agreement, together with an initial royalty payment of US$300,000, will be completed within this 120 day period and will grant BIO an exclusive licence to develop and market clinical diagnostic assays based on the CIZ1B biomarker to facilitate the early detection of lung cancer in North America.\n\u2022\nMinimum advance royalty payments of US$2.3 million, as part of the 10% royalty to be paid on gross revenues minus taxes, are due over a period of 30 months following signing of a binding agreement.\n\u2022\nOn completion of the binding agreement, Cizzle will own 10% of BIO for no cash consideration.\n\u2022\nCizzle has been selected by a major cancer centre in the US to evaluate CIZ1B testing as part of an important clinical study, to confirm whether lung nodules identified by CT scanning are positive for the CIZ1B biomarker.\n\u2022\nBIO expects to register its\nfirst US CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments) accredited lab with the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration) for the CIZ1B LDT test in September 2024\n\u2022\nBIO plan to achieve CLIA Certification for the LDT test in November 2024, with insurer reimbursement code achievement and full product launch April 2025.\nFurther Information\nLung cancer remains the biggest cause of cancer deaths worldwide, with nearly 5000 people losing their lives daily to the disease. Other than the ability of pathologists to confirm the presence of cancer, the current gold standard for detection remains CT scanning, which produces a high rate of false positive results. To\nreduce premature cancer deaths, improve survival rates and increase quality of life a simple blood test that can facilitate early cancer detection is needed.\nAs part of the Company's global licensing strategy, and stated aims to deploy its first commercial tests in the USA, the partnership with BIO is already achieving significant results. The decision of a large cancer centre to select Cizzle's CIZ1B biomarker as part of its clinical evaluation is a major endorsement of the Company's technology. With clear milestones established to roll out the commercial test by 2025, the Company is poised to help address the current low uptake in cancer testing, in relation to\nthe US Preventive Services Task Force's target of screening 14.2 million at-risk adults.\nWith guaranteed royalties over a 30-month period, a potential upside in value through the company's 10% ownership of BIO, Cizzle will accelerate the development, regulatory approval and launch of its biomarker diagnostic tests in North America. This will be followed by, and will enable, similar strategies elsewhere in the world.\nAllan Syms, Executive Chairman of Cizzle Biotechnology, said:\n\"\nAfter years of research at the University of York and further investment ",

As set out below, and subject to binding documentation, the proposed royalty arrangements with CorePath will be restructured to enable the Company to gain significant cash flows from new royalty payments and significant cost savings. All planned expenditure related to clinical trials and the commercialization of diagnostic tests for the CIZ1B biomarker in the USA are expected to be funded directly by BIO. In addition, the Company will benefit from the free issue of shares in BIO. BIO is paying a non-refundable upfront fee of US$100,000 within 30 days of signing the MoU for a 120-day exclusivity period to complete the formal legally binding agreement.\nKey Highlights\n\u00b7\nThe MoU envisages Cizzle providing an exclusive licence to BIO to develop and market clinical diagnostic assays based on the CIZ1B biomarker to facilitate the early detection of lung cancer in North America\n\u00b7\nCizzle will receive an up-front payment of US$100,000 within 30 days as a non-refundable fee to grant BIO an exclusive negotiating period of 120 days\n\u00b7\nSubject to entering binding documentation, Cizzle will receive minimum advance royalty payments of US$2.3 million over a period of 30 months, payable as to US$0.3 million on signing the binding agreement and a further US$1.0 million on each of the fifteenth and thirtieth month anniversaries of signing as part of annual royalty fees of 10% of net sales\n\u00b7\nBIO intends to fully fund all expenditure on development, clinical trials, accreditation and marketing of diagnostic tests for the CIZ1B Biomarker in North America which would represent a significant saving on current planned expenditure by the Company\n\u00b7\nCizzle will participate in the ownership of BIO through a grant of a 10% equity stake in BIO for no cash consideration\n\u00b7\nCizzle will benefit from inventions and improvements to CIZ1B technology for sale in the rest of the world\nFurther Information\nCizzle's vision is to meet the challenges of early lung cancer detection,\nreduce premature cancer deaths, improve survival rates and increase quality of life for cancer patients by helping detect cancer as early as possible through a simple blood test.\nOn 26 March 2024, the Company completed a placing raising gross proceeds of \u00a3620,000,\nwhich will be utilised towards completing Cizzle's first proposed commercial test to detect CIZ1B, further protect its Intellectual Property (IP), progress the Company's research with the University of York and for general corporate purposes.\nKey expected future milestones are the manufacturing and scale up of key antibodies and reagents, that following performance testing in clinical trials are intended to become the core components of the Company's commercial test for the CIZ1B biomarker.\nIt is intended that the clinical trials and first commercial tests will be launched in the USA, in part because l\nung cancer is by far the leading cause of cancer death there and the US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines now recommends screening for 14.2 million at-risk adults*. With current take up of lung cancer screening tests at less than 10% of the at-risk population, the unmet need is for a simple blood test such as that being developed by Cizzle for the CIZ1B Biomarker.\nThe Company believes that as we enter this pivotal phase to accelerate the development, regulatory approval and launch of its biomarker diagnostic tests in North America the establishment of an independently financed and locally managed business is the appropriate route to take. BIO will be able to focus on bringing the Company's technology to market through building close relationships with key hospitals and clinical cancer centres and bringing together key opinion leaders and clinicians to drive adoption in this important market.\nBIO will be led by Bill Behnke, who was appointed by the Company on 16 June 2022,\nto identify and facilitate growth within\nthe USA through his network in the clinical and healthcare industry. He was responsible for putting in place Cizzle's co-operation with CorePath Laboratories. Through BIO, the Company will benefit from working clo",

The net proceeds will enable the Company to enter into the manufacturing and scale up of key antibodies and reagents, that following performance testing in clinical trials are intended to become the core components of our first proposed commercial test for the CIZ1B biomarker. I look forward to providing further updates as matters progress.\"\nBackground to and reasons for the Placing\nSince the release of the Company's interim results to 30 June 2023 on 28 September 2023, Cizzle has continued to make progress\nin the development of the Company's proprietary assay for the CIZ1B biomarker, which is highly associated with early-stage lung cancer. In particular, the Company has successfully completed an antibody development programme with ProteoGenix, a France-based antibody development and production contract research organisation (CRO), with a track record in generating antibodies from development to production for therapeutic, diagnostic and research use. The Directors believe that the new antibodies from this development programme should extend the range and proprietary rights that the Company has for detecting the CIZ1B Biomarker.\nThe net proceeds of the Placing will be deployed primarily to enter the scale-up and manufacturing phase for the main components of the Company's proposed commercial test for CIZ1B. Key anticipated milestones will be the production of a final antibody to accredited quality standards, other design and testing work, IP protection and progressing regulatory matters. It is currently anticipated that clinical trials of commercial grade components and ultimately the launch of the first test for CIZ1B will be in the USA. The Company will also use the net proceeds of the Placing to continue to support core research being undertaken on the Company's behalf at the University of York and for general corporate purposes.\nDetails of the Placing\nThe fundraise comprises a Placing of\n31,050,000\nnew Ordinary Shares (the\n\"Placing Shares\"\n)\nat the Issue Price\n. The Placing Shares are to be issued pursuant to the\nauthorities granted to the Board at the Company's annual general meeting held on 28 June 2023 on a non-pre-emptive basis.\nWhen issued, the Placing Shares will represent approximately 7.83 per cent of the enlarged share capital of the Company and will rank\npari passu\nwith the existing Ordinary Shares.\nThe Issue Price represents a discount of approximately 22 pe",

This agreement also extended access to state of the art facilities and world leading scientists to support new solutions for early cancer diagnostics and therapeutic tools.\n\u00b7\nOn 12 June 2023 the Group announced that it had raised gross proceeds of \u00a3350,000 at an issue price of 2.1p per share. A variation to the Company's \u00a3500,000 loan facility agreement was announced whereby repayment of any drawdown on this facility now being satisfied by the issue of new ordinary shares in the Company at a fixed price of 2.1p per share. This facility was extended until 8 December 2024.\nPost Period Highlights\n\u00b7\nThe Company has a put option to sell its 5% economic interest and royalty sharing agreement in the AZD 1656 asset to treat inflammatory pulmonary and\ncardiovascular disease (\"Option\") to Conduit Pharmaceuticals (\"Conduit\"), to be satisfied through the issuance of new shares in Conduit (the \"Option\").\nConduit became a publicly traded company on NASDAQ in the USA on 25 September 2023. Cizzle exercised its Option on 26 September 2023 and once this has been settled, the Company is expected to hold 395,460 shares in the NASDAQ listed business with no restrictions.\n\u00b7\nOn 10 August 2023 the Group announced an expansion of its current research programme with the University of York to develop its CIZ1B biomarker\ntechnology for early stage cancer diagnosis, and other potential applications in cancer therapy. This follows significant progress in isolating additional new and specific monoclonal antibodies to the CIZ1B biomarker and incorporating these into a new high-throughput clinical diagnostic immunoassay platform. The recent developments meet key milestones to begin commercial clinical trials. The Company is now engaged in clinical trials design to support the validation and accreditation of the CIZ1B test prior to commercial launch.\n\u00b7\nOn 19 September 2023 the Group and Bio-Techne Corporation, a NASDAQ Tech listed company, announced progress evaluating specific monoclonal antibodies for Cizzle's CIZ1B cancer biomarker. Cizzle has successfully completed an evaluation programme aimed at assessing the feasibility of using the Simple Western platform from ProteinSimple (a Bio-Techne brand) for high throughput detection of the CIZ1B cancer biomarker which may be useful in the detection of early-stage lung cancer.\nCommenting Allan Syms, Chairman of Cizzle Biotechnology, said\n:\n\"The Group continued to make excellent progress during the first half of 2023 as key milestones were met in the development of our proprietary assay for the CIZ1B biomarker which is highly associated with early stage lung cancer. About 5,000 people die of lung cancer every day which in part is due to the lack of simple tests that can detect cancer early and as a result lead to diagnosis when the disease is more advanced and survival rates are poor.\n\"We have now expanded our range of specific monoclonal antibodies for CIZ1B and as recently reported we are now deploying these on a high throughput laboratory platform provided by Bio-Techne, a $12 billion market capitalised life science and biomedical research group. Bio-Techne have worked closely with Prof Coverley's research team at the University of York and, having completed a successful evaluation programme, we are now able us to accelerate our clinical trials programme, initially in the USA.\n\"\nOur goal remains to develop simple, inexpensive, blood tests for early cancer detection that can help save lives. The priority will be to complete clinical trials and achieve LDT (Laboratory Developed Test) accreditation and then to expand the use of our CIZ1B antibodies for use in a lateral flow format, such as that now commonly used for COVID antigen detection which will provide a familiar test format with an established global distribution infrastructure.\"\n\"We have also previously reported on our ambitions\nto expand our target customer base in the pharmaceutical industry through building a portfolio of early cancer detection tests, companion diagnostics and royalty bearing stakes in significant drug assets. We were therefore, pleased to report in the past few weeks the positive development arising from the merger of our partners Conduit Pharmaceuticals with\nMurphy Canyon Acquisition Corp. resulting in Conduit bec",

This follows significant progress in isolating additional new and specific monoclonal antibodies to the CIZ1B biomarker and incorporating these into a new high-throughput clinical diagnostic immunoassay platform. The recent developments meet key milestones to begin commercial clinical trials. The Company is now engaged in clinical trials design to support the validation and accreditation of the CIZ1B test prior to commercial launch.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nSuccessful development of additional specific monoclonal antibodies for CIZ1B Biomarker\n\u00b7\nApplication to a new high-throughput immunoassay platform.\n\u00b7\nSignificant expansion of current\nresearch and development agreement with the University of\nYork, to allow continued\naccess to state of the art facilities and world-leading scientists.\n\u00b7\nAll intellectual property rights arising from the work to be owned by the\nCompany\nCizzle Biotechnology and the University of York have benefited from a long-standing close relationship since the Company was spun out from the University in 2006. That collaboration has continued since the Company was\nadmitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange\nand currently has a funded programme until 25 September 2024. During this period the team at the University of York under the direction of Professor Dawn Coverley has successfully isolated and validated an additional panel of specific monoclonal antibodies for the CIZ1B biomarker, which is highly associated with early stage lung cancer.\nA key milestone for the Company was to take the proof of concept test for CIZ1B and develop an accredited and commercially viable assay that could be used in a laboratory to test for early stage lung cancer. A common first approach to achieve this, known as an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), involves a multistep process of analysing multiple blood samples in either manual or robotic handling systems. A major breakthrough by the team at the University of York has significantly improved on this traditional approach using alternative high-throughput assay formats for CIZ1B, that will now be used as the basis for a commercial product.\nThe next steps are to finalise standard production and operating protocols and to commence clinical trials that should lead to an accredited Laboratory Developed (LDT) test for launch initially in the USA. The Company will then extend that to other key markets and will extend its use through regulatory approval with the FDA in the USA, the EMA for a CE mark in Europe, the MHRA in the UK for UKCA approval, and with the appropriate regulatory groups elsewhere in the world including China.\nCizzle Biotechnology will\ncontinue to\nown all intellectual property rights and, through its further funding of research programmes at the University of York, aims to create new solutions for early cancer diagnostics and develop new therapeutic tools.\nCommenting, Allan Syms, Executive Chairman of Cizzle Biotechnology, said:\n\"The University of York has been the home of the Company's research and development from its inception. Under the expert and insightful leadership of Professor Coverley, the laboratory team have made excellent progress in developing our test for the CIZ1B Biomarker to be used for detecting lung cancer at its earliest stage. This provides a much-needed solution to early diagnosis, which can save lives. The latest exciting developments have met important milestones and so I am delighted to expand our investment with the University, which continues to provide support to the Company from the leading-edge research and state of the art laboratories. This new agreement aligns will an exciting phase of the Company's plans to achieve regulatory approval and bring our early detection tests for lung cancer to market\n.\"\nEnquiries:\nCizzle Biotechnology Holdings\nplc\nVia IFC\nAdvisory\nAllan Syms (Executive\nChairman)\nAllenby Capital\nLimited\n+44(0) 20\n33285656\nJohn Depasquale Alex Brearley\nNovum Securities\nLimited\n+44(0) 20 7399\n9400\nColin Rowbury Jon Belliss\nIFC Advisory\nLimited\n+44(0) 20 3934\n6630\nTim Metcalfe Florence Chandler\nAbout the\nCompany\nCizzle Biotechnology is developing a blood test for the early detection of lung cancer.

The completion of this Conduit-Murphy Transaction is expected to occur in 2023. On 12 May 2023, Murphy made a preliminary proxy statement/prospectus Securities and Exchange Commission Form S-4 filing\nin the USA,\nwhich represents part of the process for progressing the Conduit-Murphy Transaction, and is available for viewing on the United States Securities and Exchange Commission's website.\nFor more information, please see Murphy's filing here:\nhttps://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=1896212\nShould Cizzle exercise its Option and the Conduit-Murphy Transaction completes, the Company\nwill hold shares in the Conduit-Murphy merged business, thereafter to be called Conduit, which will become a publicly traded company on NASDAQ in the USA.

Its proof-of-concept protype test is based on the ability to measure a stable blood plasma biomarker, a variant of CIZ1. CIZ1 is a naturally occurring cell nuclear protein involved in DNA replication, and the targeted CIZ1B variant is highly correlated with early-stage lung cancer.\nPublished research led by Professor Coverley previously demonstrated that CIZ1B can be measured with high sensitivity via an ELISA process, which should allow for testing in a high-throughput, hospital-friendly format. The Directors believe that this development overcomes an important barrier to further clinical development and the application of this blood test for the early detection of lung cancer, which is essential to improve a patient's chance of survival.\nIn addition to implementing a strategy to develop a regulatory approved commercial, diagnostic laboratory immunoassay for early-stage lung cancer, the Group has broadened its interests to include the detection of a range of other early-stage cancers. It has also expanded its potential customer base to include the pharmaceutical industry through a contract to develop a diagnostic test that can help in the development of personalised medicines, so called \"companion diagnostics\", and has secured royalty bearing rights to the sale of such medicines in the longer term.\nThe Board intends for the Group's initial product to be a diagnostic immunoassay that can be readily performed by hospitals and reference laboratories, but a potential follow-on product could be a point of care test provided by a primary health care provider.\nResearch and Development\nThroughout 2022, the Company continued to work with external expert partners and suppliers to develop and supply of proprietary key monoclonal antibodies and other detector proteins for its assay platform, and in July 2022 the Company provided an update on the progress of this work. A key milestone was the characterisation of a mouse monoclonal antibody that specifically detects CIZ1B. Assay conditions for its use are being optimised, as well as further work to broaden access to other antibodies that can be used in its proprietary early lung cancer tests, and potentially for a range of other early-stage cancers.\nOn 11 April 2022 a new 12 month research agreement was signed with the University of York, a member of the Russell Group of research-intensive universities and one of the world's premier institutions for inspirational and life-changing research, for the development of potential applications in cancer diagnosis and therapy. The agreement, commenced on 25 June 2022 for a period of 12 months, following the successful previous programme announced on 17 September 2021 for the development and validation of molecular tools with potential application in cancer diagnosis or therapy, and their configuration into assays for Cizzle's proprietary cancer biomarker variants. On 24 April 2023, the Company announced that\nthis research\nprogramme had met some critical milestones, especially in optimising the platform and antibodies required to scale up and bring to market our diagnostic tests for earlystage cancer detection. As such a further new agreement has been signed with the University lasting until 25 September 2024. This programme will continue development of its CIZ 1B biomarker technology for early-stage cancer diagnosis and with potential applications in cancer therapy. This includes the evaluation of the biomarker for detecting a range of\nother\ncancers in addition to the existing assay for early lung cancer detection.\nA\ns in previous agreements,\nCizzle Biotechnology will own all intellectual property rights arising from the work which strengthens the Company's position in creating new solutions for early cancer diagnostics and therapeutic tools.\nDevelopment of new future revenue stream\nOn 14 February 2022 the Group announced a royalty acquisition agreement with Conduit and SGSC to acquire a 5% economic interest in the commercialisation of the AZD1656 asset or such other assets being developed by Conduit or SGSC to treat inflammatory pulmonary and cardiovascular disease, for a total consideration of \u00a31.88m. The initial consideration of \u00a31m was settled through the issue of 25,000,000 new ordinary shares at a price of 4.0p per share, with the remaining consideration of \u00a30.88m settled in September 2022 through the issue of 22,000,000 new ordinary shares at 4.0p per share.

This year, we delivered several major steps forward: North American Expansion \u2013 Having completed our exclusive licensing agreement with Cizzle Bio Inc. for the USA and Canada, our licensing partners have signed their first contracts with commercial clinical laboratories to launch our biomarker test following CLIA certification, opening the door to one of the world\u2019s largest healthcare markets. UK Healthcare Engagement \u2013 We signed a Letter of Intent with a major UK laboratory provider serving the National Health Service, which may lead to an exclusive UK partnership and co-branded rollout across NHS and private markets in the UK. This underscores our commitment to making early lung cancer detection accessible nationally. Clinical Validation at Leading Centres \u2013 Our selection by the Moffitt Cancer Center in Florida marked a pivotal milestone, the first major clinical evaluation of the CIZ1B biomarker in patients with suspicious lung nodules. Advancing the Science \u2013 We continue to collaborate with the University of York, driving innovation and creating new IP for the CIZ1B biomarker. Looking Ahead With scientific innovation, clinical evaluation, and commercial partnerships aligning, 2026 is set to be a transformative year for blood-based lung cancer screening. Using biomarker-driven tests like ours offer a powerful complementary pathway to LDCT scanning helping provide earlier, more accurate detection. As this awareness month closes, we\u2019re reminded that progress is born from persistence, partnership, and purpose. The breakthroughs emerging today offer hope for tomorrow\u2019s patients, and Cizzle remains committed to leading that change. https://cizzlebiotechnology.com/reflecting-on-lung-cancer-awareness-month-and-purpose/",

And Ciz UK bulling about April launch right up to the date -when they obviously knew. Can't believe a word regarding timelines. They just throw words into the air to keep it trundling along. Comms are THE PITS. Could be this year for launch, could be next, could be never if it's not validated properly. I'm expecting more of these mini fundraisers that have been going on . It may all be going swimmingly, but it may not. Who knows where the company that cannot tell the truth on timelines.",

As for the UK Plc, there are only four of them. AS predominantly full time, DC has a research lab to run aswell, and then two part-timers so progress from the licence holder isn\u2019t going to be as quick as desired, I can\u2019t see them expanding the team to expedite progress otherwise this would have been done previously\u2026 In terms of criticism, there are a few key weaknesses imv\u2026and shared by most I assume\u2026 1. Commercial directorship - pace could be increased in terms of other regions. Validation processes will always take time but non-scientific elements you would expect could have been expedited. 2. Lack of comms - age old issue which hasn\u2019t improved. Still using Directors Talk which is very limited, no Q&A, no attempt to engage new investors, 3-4 trades a day the result of lack of visibility. Assumption is they are relying on milestones to realise value but still feels way too passive. 3. Economic with the truth - not unique to Ciz by any stretch, communicate after issue has been resolved - there are a couple of occasions where goalposts have changed but with no explanation\u2026namely mAb production from Proteogenix to BBI and then the move from iGenomeDX to OmnihealthDX, the pathfinder narrative didn\u2019t feel accurate. You\u2019d expect things to go wrong / need to change direction, but would be beneficial if there was a more honest dialogue. As an investor it\u2019s hard to argue too much with you OldMoot given SP is languishing at 1.5p and MC at \u00a35mn is way below the IPOd \u00a322mn\u2026. so far, it\u2019s fundamentally underperformed and purely from an investors perspective you\u2019d clearly have been better off invested elsewhere. (There\u2019s no doubting the company aim is a very worthwhile one and hope it flies globally to help improve prognosis of those with a positive LC diagnosis.) Anyway, given CLIA accreditation, launch, grant funding, UK LoI conversion (hopefully) etc\u2026 are \u201cnear term\u201d hoping Q1 \u201826 finally sees value being realised\u2026 it\u2019s been a painful wait but fundamentals still seem positive (to me at least)\u2026 (hopefully no RNS before Christmas\u2026) Merry Christmas all!",

Following the progress made by their pathfinder clinical laboratory, BIO's strategy has developed to more appropriately reflect the large market opportunity they are seeing for the Company's CIZ1B biomarker test in North America.  They have therefore realigned their accreditation and market launch plans to the new multi-site clinical laboratory to enable a much wider co-ordinated and comprehensive campaign to roll out the CIZ1B biomarker test in North America, to help detect early-stage lung cancer. This new agreement with a significantly larger multi-site clinical laboratory demonstrates how BIO intends to scale its operations throughout the USA. \"BIO's commitment to our strong partnership is also evident by the receipt of an early advance royalty payment which means the Company has now received US$525,000. We have since agreed to a more balanced payment schedule through to the end of 2026 which will see the remainder of the advance royalty fees being received by Cizzle Biotechnology earlier. \"I look forward to announcing further updates on BIO's commercial progress in North America and the Company's strategy to make its CIZ1B biomarker test available globally in due course.\"",

(And I've stated it in the past) Even if they do overcome the (obviously problematic) obstacle to commercialisation, what does that actually look like? If they get the PR right , it opens to a great fanfair r in the US, share price (MC) spikes to maybe 15-25 mill market cap. Then what? Sales are predicted to be very slow...so share price slumps back to maybe 10mill MC. So what happens then? I predict a massive fundraiser in the UK to get the ball rolling over here and in Europe. At the same time Alan Symms is definitely not the leader to take this forward imo. He has no charisma or energy. So there's a share price that is halved or three quartered by a fundraiser. Probably another spike as there's news of a partner in the UK. Share price falls back...then what? (Probably a year or two years to get it going in the UK... While in the USA sales go at snails pace) In the meantime there will be other products coming to market that supersede it. Probably at some point the US company is taken out. Maybe Ciz UK is taken out for peanuts. And that's how I see the long term!",

When a biotech is getting close to signing a partnership, it almost never says so directly \u2014 but it always leaves a trail of signals. Investors who follow deal\u2011making watch these patterns closely because they tend to repeat across companies and across years. Here\u2019s a deeper look at how companies signal a deal is close, with each signal broken down into what it really means behind the scenes. \ud83d\udd0d The Subtle (but Reliable) Signals a Deal Is Near 1. Senior leadership suddenly becomes very visible CEO and CSO attending partnering events together Multiple executives presenting instead of just one Frequent interviews or investor updates When a deal is early, business development teams handle it. When a deal is close, executives must be present because final terms require top\u2011level approval. 2. The company attends high\u2011level partnering conferences JP Morgan Healthcare Conference BIO International Convention Biotech Showcase in San Francisco These events are where final negotiations often happen. Companies don\u2019t send their full leadership team unless they expect meaningful progress. 3. Language in press releases becomes more specific Look for shifts like: \u201cWe are in discussions\u201d \u2192 \u201cadvanced discussions with multiple parties\u201d \u201cExploring options\u201d \u2192 \u201cdetailed due diligence underway\u201d \u201cEngagement ongoing\u201d \u2192 \u201cmultiple confidentiality agreements signed\u201d Public companies choose their words carefully. When the language tightens, it\u2019s intentional. 4. Silence \u2014 the good kind Fewer scientific updates No new exploratory programs announced Reduced commentary on timelines When a deal is close, companies often go quiet because: they\u2019re under NDA they don\u2019t want to disrupt negotiations they\u2019re preparing coordinated announcements with the partner Silence is often louder than words. 5. The company begins referencing \u201cvalue inflection\u201d events \u201cTransformational opportunity\u201d \u201cStrategic partnership discussions\u201d \u201cMultiple interested parties\u201d This is coded language for: We\u2019re negotiating, and we want the market to know something big is coming. \ud83e\udde0 The strongest signal of all When a company says it is: meeting multiple top\u201110 pharma companies, attending JP Morgan with its full leadership team, and has multiple confidentiality agreements signed, that confidentiality agreements signed, This is a sign that a deal is in the late stages.",

Updates would be most welcome from; 5 Nov 25 RNS: Letter of Intent (\"LOI\") with a leading medical diagnostic services provider (the \"Provider\") acting in partnership with the NHS. The LOI covers the verification and validation of the Company's CIZ1B biomarker test with a NHS Foundation Trust partner in state-of-the-art laboratories which may lead to the Provider being appointed as the Company's exclusive UK supplier of the CIZ1B test. \u00b7 Commercial Launch: In August 2025, following progress achieved at their pathfinder lab, BIO realigned their accreditation and market launch strategy with a new multi-site clinical laboratory, enabling a much wider co-ordinated and comprehensive campaign to roll out the CIZ1B biomarker test in North America. Omni Health Diagnostics (\"Omni\") announced in September 2025 that the roll out programme will be nationwide in at least six states with potential further expansion. This demonstrates how BIO intends to scale its operations to meet expected demand in the USA. \u00b7 Moffitt Cancer Center Collaboration: On 9 September 2024, the Group was selected by Moffitt Cancer Center (\"Moffitt\"), Florida's leading cancer hospital, to test patients with suspicious lung nodules in a clinical evaluation using the Group's proprietary CIZ1B biomarker assay. Since then, Moffitt has been recruiting patients and collecting blood samples to ship to the University of York. We expect samples to be received shortly and testing to begin in Q4 2025. This important study to test patients for the presence of the CIZ1B Biomarker is part of a major clinical evaluation for suspected lung cancer patients. Short term finances seem secure with the financial support from Frazer Lang and the 'guaranteed' royalties  of $2.4M to be paid by December this year ($530K received by Nov 2025)",

Since validation should not take as long as this, maybe it's fair to draw some conclusions. (See point 1) Notice there's been a few chunky sells today. Hard to gauge what is going on behind the scenes with such a dreadful company regarding shareholder respect",

I\u2019m now wondering how long it would take a UK partner to get this test through the various regulatory hurdles in order to get this into a live clinical setting, lab or LFT driven\u2026 NHS AS has chosen the US market to launch the test due to the much narrower timescales in achieving a market ready test via. a LDT accreditation. Once achieved he is in a much stronger position to approach a partner of the likes of Siemens or Abbott in the task of attaining UKCA accreditation. This would likely involve licensing our tech to enable one of these types of Companies to run the required clinical trials on their proprietary platforms. Such trials are much more defined, time consuming and costly than a LDT. As such, the NHS, whilst an obvious goal, remains secondary to the US trial. Remember, we\u2019re running with a licensing model here. IMHO VV",

Exact Sciences shareholders will receive $105 a share. The stock rose 17.9% to $101.60 in morning trading after closing at $86.18 Wednesday. The transaction is among the biggest in life sciences this year. It gives Abbott exposure to the fast-growing cancer screening market. Exact Sciences offers cancer screening and diagnostic products, including Cologuard, a colorectal cancer screening test. Exact is one of the companies that has developed blood tests that can detect several types of cancers at early stages. It is competing with Grail, Guardant Health and other companies. Cancer is one of the biggest and fastest-growing healthcare markets. Scientific advances have pointed to new treatments that have helped turn some cancers into manageable diseases. Advances have also pointed to tests to detect genetic risks of cancer or to detect cancer earlier, when treatment is likely to be more effective. Abbott, which sells a range of medical products including heart devices and generic drugs, has long had its own diagnostics business, including a widely used at-home Covid-19 test. Its diagnostics sales have sagged as demand for Covid tests faded, and adding cancer diagnostics could boost Abbott\u2019s sales growth while offering potential for cost savings, analysts said. \u201cOur vision here is really to build the premier cancer diagnostics company in the world,\u201d Abbott Chief Executive Robert Ford said on a conference call with analysts. \u201cI think a combination together with Exact Sciences puts us in a really good position to go after that.\u201d Abbott shares declined 2% in morning trading. Bernstein healthcare analysts questioned the deal in a research note, saying it had \u201cno real strategic rationale.\u201d They also said the deal\u2019s high price tag could limit Abbott\u2019s ability to use cash for other deals or share buybacks. Exact Sciences is projected to generate more than $3 billion in revenue this year. With the acquisition, Abbott\u2019s total diagnostics sales will exceed $12 billion annually. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of 2026. After the deal closes, Exact Sciences will maintain its presence in Madison, Wis. and Chief Executive Kevin Conroy will remain with the company in an advisory role.",

          "content": "Hi Hogbog, Not sure I should offer views on timescales\u2026got it wrong last time! We know it was end of Sept when AS was saying it\u2019ll be in the hands of doctors in H2\u2026so on that basis you\u2019d say imminent. However, suspect this might be New Year for launch now, and hope it is given disruption of Thanksgiving/Christmas. I\u2019m still thinking there is other news that we could/should see before launch, so this year. They must have submitted clinical data using the commercial mAbs to obtain CLIA accreditation. We\u2019ve not seen that data as yet, but given they\u2019re still calling out 95% sensitivity and meant to be launching this quarter, you\u2019d like to think the commercial test is in line with the lab one. They\u2019d lack credibility to sit down two weeks ago with the likes of Caris and AZ and talk about their commercial test if the data wasn\u2019t up to scratch a few weeks later (not sure there is a lot to draw from their attendance at the NY event. AZ connection goes back years\u2026including St.George Capital/Conduit drug do might just be calling in contacts. Likewise, new recruit Dr Mark Miglarese was at Caris so might just be ex-colleagues) They\u2019d also need the clinical data to cover off the ethnicity question. One third of the population of US is black / Hispanic, so can\u2019t launch without proof point its effective for those ethnicities. So, I\u2019m expecting pre-launch, publication of clinical validity and also CLIA accreditation. Linked to those is the Medicaid/Medicare reimbursement confirmation. I\u2019d expect that to come quite quickly after launch. Launch would be for privately funded tests, but the insurer approval is fundamental to broader roll out. Given Dr Greeno\u2019s experience in that area, driving federal policy etc\u2026 and J Hinkel\u2019s work on economics of the test you\u2019d think that is straightforward. In the case of OBD reimbursement approval was only one week after launch. There is then the timing re LoI for UK partner and China. I exchanged messages with Tim M a couple of weeks back and mentioned China is still in scope but subject to CLIA accreditation, so \u201cmay\u201d get something on that in short order after US CLIA approval. Can\u2019t imagine it will be quick to implement but anything that takes the Alliance/MoU and leads to commercial contract will be interesting - recognise lot of folks see this as a double-edged sword. In the background, still expect a partner to come on board in the US to help speed up rollout. BIO have previously stated they also want LATAM licence and not convinced they have funds. Once they have the two tests CLIA compliant, suggests greater scope for a tie up and diagnostics increasing in focus. Note all the above is in the hands of BIO\u2026extent to which UK Plc push the good news remains to be seen. Just personal take on where they are at..",

This year, we delivered several major steps forward: North American Expansion \u2013 Having completed our exclusive licensing agreement with Cizzle Bio Inc. for the USA and Canada, our licensing partners have signed their first contracts with commercial clinical laboratories to launch our biomarker test following CLIA certification, opening the door to one of the world\u2019s largest healthcare markets. UK Healthcare Engagement \u2013 We signed a Letter of Intent with a major UK laboratory provider serving the National Health Service, which may lead to an exclusive UK partnership and co-branded rollout across NHS and private markets in the UK. This underscores our commitment to making early lung cancer detection accessible nationally. Clinical Validation at Leading Centres \u2013 Our selection by the Moffitt Cancer Center in Florida marked a pivotal milestone, the first major clinical evaluation of the CIZ1B biomarker in patients with suspicious lung nodules. Advancing the Science \u2013 We continue to collaborate with the University of York, driving innovation and creating new IP for the CIZ1B biomarker. Looking Ahead With scientific innovation, clinical evaluation, and commercial partnerships aligning, 2026 is set to be a transformative year for blood-based lung cancer screening. Using biomarker-driven tests like ours offer a powerful complementary pathway to LDCT scanning helping provide earlier, more accurate detection. As this awareness month closes, we\u2019re reminded that progress is born from persistence, partnership, and purpose. The breakthroughs emerging today offer hope for tomorrow\u2019s patients, and Cizzle remains committed to leading that change. https://cizzlebiotechnology.com/reflecting-on-lung-cancer-awareness-month-and-purpose/",

And Ciz UK bulling about April launch right up to the date -when they obviously knew. Can't believe a word regarding timelines. They just throw words into the air to keep it trundling along. Comms are THE PITS. Could be this year for launch, could be next, could be never if it's not validated properly. I'm expecting more of these mini fundraisers that have been going on . It may all be going swimmingly, but it may not. Who knows where the company that cannot tell the truth on timelines.",

As for the UK Plc, there are only four of them. AS predominantly full time, DC has a research lab to run aswell, and then two part-timers so progress from the licence holder isn\u2019t going to be as quick as desired, I can\u2019t see them expanding the team to expedite progress otherwise this would have been done previously\u2026 In terms of criticism, there are a few key weaknesses imv\u2026and shared by most I assume\u2026 1. Commercial directorship - pace could be increased in terms of other regions. Validation processes will always take time but non-scientific elements you would expect could have been expedited. 2. Lack of comms - age old issue which hasn\u2019t improved. Still using Directors Talk which is very limited, no Q&A, no attempt to engage new investors, 3-4 trades a day the result of lack of visibility. Assumption is they are relying on milestones to realise value but still feels way too passive. 3. Economic with the truth - not unique to Ciz by any stretch, communicate after issue has been resolved - there are a couple of occasions where goalposts have changed but with no explanation\u2026namely mAb production from Proteogenix to BBI and then the move from iGenomeDX to OmnihealthDX, the pathfinder narrative didn\u2019t feel accurate. You\u2019d expect things to go wrong / need to change direction, but would be beneficial if there was a more honest dialogue. As an investor it\u2019s hard to argue too much with you OldMoot given SP is languishing at 1.5p and MC at \u00a35mn is way below the IPOd \u00a322mn\u2026. so far, it\u2019s fundamentally underperformed and purely from an investors perspective you\u2019d clearly have been better off invested elsewhere. (There\u2019s no doubting the company aim is a very worthwhile one and hope it flies globally to help improve prognosis of those with a positive LC diagnosis.) Anyway, given CLIA accreditation, launch, grant funding, UK LoI conversion (hopefully) etc\u2026 are \u201cnear term\u201d hoping Q1 \u201826 finally sees value being realised\u2026 it\u2019s been a painful wait but fundamentals still seem positive (to me at least)\u2026 (hopefully no RNS before Christmas\u2026) Merry Christmas all!",

This new agreement with a significantly larger multi-site clinical laboratory demonstrates how BIO intends to scale its operations throughout the USA. \"BIO's commitment to our strong partnership is also evident by the receipt of an early advance royalty payment which means the Company has now received US$525,000.

(And I've stated it in the past) Even if they do overcome the (obviously problematic) obstacle to commercialisation, what does that actually look like? If they get the PR right , it opens to a great fanfair r in the US, share price (MC) spikes to maybe 15-25 mill market cap. Then what? Sales are predicted to be very slow...so share price slumps back to maybe 10mill MC. So what happens then? I predict a massive fundraiser in the UK to get the ball rolling over here and in Europe. At the same time Alan Symms is definitely not the leader to take this forward imo. He has no charisma or energy. So there's a share price that is halved or three quartered by a fundraiser. Probably another spike as there's news of a partner in the UK. Share price falls back...then what? (Probably a year or two years to get it going in the UK... While in the USA sales go at snails pace) In the meantime there will be other products coming to market that supersede it. Probably at some point the US company is taken out. Maybe Ciz UK is taken out for peanuts. And that's how I see the long term!",

          "content": "Courtesy of Bubbles223 on IMM. Just found it an interesting read and most of it related to IMM which I am not invested in. When a biotech is getting close to signing a partnership, it almost never says so directly \u2014 but it always leaves a trail of signals. Investors who follow deal\u2011making watch these patterns closely because they tend to repeat across companies and across years. Here\u2019s a deeper look at how companies signal a deal is close, with each signal broken down into what it really means behind the scenes. \ud83d\udd0d The Subtle (but Reliable) Signals a Deal Is Near 1. Senior leadership suddenly becomes very visible CEO and CSO attending partnering events together Multiple executives presenting instead of just one Frequent interviews or investor updates When a deal is early, business development teams handle it. When a deal is close, executives must be present because final terms require top\u2011level approval. 2. The company attends high\u2011level partnering conferences JP Morgan Healthcare Conference BIO International Convention Biotech Showcase in San Francisco These events are where final negotiations often happen. Companies don\u2019t send their full leadership team unless they expect meaningful progress. 3. Language in press releases becomes more specific Look for shifts like: \u201cWe are in discussions\u201d \u2192 \u201cadvanced discussions with multiple parties\u201d \u201cExploring options\u201d \u2192 \u201cdetailed due diligence underway\u201d \u201cEngagement ongoing\u201d \u2192 \u201cmultiple confidentiality agreements signed\u201d Public companies choose their words carefully. When the language tightens, it\u2019s intentional. 4. Silence \u2014 the good kind Fewer scientific updates No new exploratory programs announced Reduced commentary on timelines When a deal is close, companies often go quiet because: they\u2019re under NDA they don\u2019t want to disrupt negotiations they\u2019re preparing coordinated announcements with the partner Silence is often louder than words. 5. The company begins referencing \u201cvalue inflection\u201d events \u201cTransformational opportunity\u201d \u201cStrategic partnership discussions\u201d \u201cMultiple interested parties\u201d This is coded language for: We\u2019re negotiating, and we want the market to know something big is coming. \ud83e\udde0 The strongest signal of all When a company says it is: meeting multiple top\u201110 pharma companies, attending JP Morgan with its full leadership team, and has multiple confidentiality agreements signed, that confidentiality agreements signed, This is a sign that a deal is in the late stages.",

Updates would be most welcome from; 5 Nov 25 RNS: Letter of Intent (\"LOI\") with a leading medical diagnostic services provider (the \"Provider\") acting in partnership with the NHS. The LOI covers the verification and validation of the Company's CIZ1B biomarker test with a NHS Foundation Trust partner in state-of-the-art laboratories which may lead to the Provider being appointed as the Company's exclusive UK supplier of the CIZ1B test. \u00b7 Commercial Launch: In August 2025, following progress achieved at their pathfinder lab, BIO realigned their accreditation and market launch strategy with a new multi-site clinical laboratory, enabling a much wider co-ordinated and comprehensive campaign to roll out the CIZ1B biomarker test in North America. Omni Health Diagnostics (\"Omni\") announced in September 2025 that the roll out programme will be nationwide in at least six states with potential further expansion. This demonstrates how BIO intends to scale its operations to meet expected demand in the USA. \u00b7 Moffitt Cancer Center Collaboration: On 9 September 2024, the Group was selected by Moffitt Cancer Center (\"Moffitt\"), Florida's leading cancer hospital, to test patients with suspicious lung nodules in a clinical evaluation using the Group's proprietary CIZ1B biomarker assay. Since then, Moffitt has been recruiting patients and collecting blood samples to ship to the University of York. We expect samples to be received shortly and testing to begin in Q4 2025. This important study to test patients for the presence of the CIZ1B Biomarker is part of a major clinical evaluation for suspected lung cancer patients. Short term finances seem secure with the financial support from Frazer Lang and the 'guaranteed' royalties  of $2.4M to be paid by December this year ($530K received by Nov 2025)",

Since validation should not take as long as this, maybe it's fair to draw some conclusions. (See point 1) Notice there's been a few chunky sells today.

They have therefore realigned their accreditation and market launch plans to the new multi-site clinical laboratory to enable a much wider co-ordinated and comprehensive campaign to roll out the CIZ1B biomarker test in North America, to help detect early-stage lung cancer. This new agreement with a significantly larger multi-site clinical laboratory demonstrates how BIO intends to scale its operations throughout the USA. \"BIO's commitment to our strong partnership is also evident by the receipt of an early advance royalty payment which means the Company has now received US$525,000. We have since agreed to a more balanced payment schedule through to the end of 2026 which will see the remainder of the advance royalty fees being received by Cizzle Biotechnology earlier. \"I look forward to announcing further updates on BIO's commercial progress in North America and the Company's strategy to make its CIZ1B biomarker test available globally in due course.\"",

(And I've stated it in the past) Even if they do overcome the (obviously problematic) obstacle to commercialisation, what does that actually look like? If they get the PR right , it opens to a great fanfair r in the US, share price (MC) spikes to maybe 15-25 mill market cap. Then what? Sales are predicted to be very slow...so share price slumps back to maybe 10mill MC. So what happens then? I predict a massive fundraiser in the UK to get the ball rolling over here and in Europe. At the same time Alan Symms is definitely not the leader to take this forward imo. He has no charisma or energy. So there's a share price that is halved or three quartered by a fundraiser. Probably another spike as there's news of a partner in the UK. Share price falls back...then what? (Probably a year or two years to get it going in the UK... While in the USA sales go at snails pace) In the meantime there will be other products coming to market that supersede it. Probably at some point the US company is taken out. Maybe Ciz UK is taken out for peanuts. And that's how I see the long term!",

          "content": "Courtesy of Bubbles223 on IMM. Just found it an interesting read and most of it related to IMM which I am not invested in. When a biotech is getting close to signing a partnership, it almost never says so directly \u2014 but it always leaves a trail of signals. Investors who follow deal\u2011making watch these patterns closely because they tend to repeat across companies and across years. Here\u2019s a deeper look at how companies signal a deal is close, with each signal broken down into what it really means behind the scenes. \ud83d\udd0d The Subtle (but Reliable) Signals a Deal Is Near 1. Senior leadership suddenly becomes very visible CEO and CSO attending partnering events together Multiple executives presenting instead of just one Frequent interviews or investor updates When a deal is early, business development teams handle it. When a deal is close, executives must be present because final terms require top\u2011level approval. 2. The company attends high\u2011level partnering conferences JP Morgan Healthcare Conference BIO International Convention Biotech Showcase in San Francisco These events are where final negotiations often happen. Companies don\u2019t send their full leadership team unless they expect meaningful progress. 3. Language in press releases becomes more specific Look for shifts like: \u201cWe are in discussions\u201d \u2192 \u201cadvanced discussions with multiple parties\u201d \u201cExploring options\u201d \u2192 \u201cdetailed due diligence underway\u201d \u201cEngagement ongoing\u201d \u2192 \u201cmultiple confidentiality agreements signed\u201d Public companies choose their words carefully. When the language tightens, it\u2019s intentional. 4. Silence \u2014 the good kind Fewer scientific updates No new exploratory programs announced Reduced commentary on timelines When a deal is close, companies often go quiet because: they\u2019re under NDA they don\u2019t want to disrupt negotiations they\u2019re preparing coordinated announcements with the partner Silence is often louder than words. 5. The company begins referencing \u201cvalue inflection\u201d events \u201cTransformational opportunity\u201d \u201cStrategic partnership discussions\u201d \u201cMultiple interested parties\u201d This is coded language for: We\u2019re negotiating, and we want the market to know something big is coming. \ud83e\udde0 The strongest signal of all When a company says it is: meeting multiple top\u201110 pharma companies, attending JP Morgan with its full leadership team, and has multiple confidentiality agreements signed, that confidentiality agreements signed, This is a sign that a deal is in the late stages.",

I'm guessing that Ciz Bio will be making good progress unless they've got a team together just a mess around for a laugh - and the yanks don't do that. They like their $$$ too much. Metaphorically  speaking (certainly not in a political way) it seems they've got a Donald Trump in charge of their operations and we've got Keir Starmer.",

Updates would be most welcome from; 5 Nov 25 RNS: Letter of Intent (\"LOI\") with a leading medical diagnostic services provider (the \"Provider\") acting in partnership with the NHS. The LOI covers the verification and validation of the Company's CIZ1B biomarker test with a NHS Foundation Trust partner in state-of-the-art laboratories which may lead to the Provider being appointed as the Company's exclusive UK supplier of the CIZ1B test. \u00b7 Commercial Launch: In August 2025, following progress achieved at their pathfinder lab, BIO realigned their accreditation and market launch strategy with a new multi-site clinical laboratory, enabling a much wider co-ordinated and comprehensive campaign to roll out the CIZ1B biomarker test in North America. Omni Health Diagnostics (\"Omni\") announced in September 2025 that the roll out programme will be nationwide in at least six states with potential further expansion. This demonstrates how BIO intends to scale its operations to meet expected demand in the USA. \u00b7 Moffitt Cancer Center Collaboration: On 9 September 2024, the Group was selected by Moffitt Cancer Center (\"Moffitt\"), Florida's leading cancer hospital, to test patients with suspicious lung nodules in a clinical evaluation using the Group's proprietary CIZ1B biomarker assay. Since then, Moffitt has been recruiting patients and collecting blood samples to ship to the University of York. We expect samples to be received shortly and testing to begin in Q4 2025. This important study to test patients for the presence of the CIZ1B Biomarker is part of a major clinical evaluation for suspected lung cancer patients. Short term finances seem secure with the financial support from Frazer Lang and the 'guaranteed' royalties  of $2.4M to be paid by December this year ($530K received by Nov 2025)",

Since validation should not take as long as this, maybe it's fair to draw some conclusions. (See point 1) Notice there's been a few chunky sells today.

Once there, its possible a lot of shuffling around will occur with stale bulls leaving, others trimming holdings, traders moving on after getting to 5.65p, and new stable investors joining and the price gradually begins to mirror the success of the company going forward. No real prediction as to where price should be within a year, but certainly where it is now shows that there is a lack of interest which is not a big deal, because sensible money will follow sensible news and behave in a orderly manner, while stupid money will follow emotional behaviour and act erratically. The aim is to see this company save lives, and personally its been just over 5.5 years for me and building over 12 times more than at RTO, given the progress. If pushed ideally I would like it to be around 10p as the base. The current price is artificial but one which the market dictates away from the newsflow present and future but because emotional erratic traders who cannot and will not see the bigger picture but want to actually trade it! LOL. That is one of the major reasons for the current levels.",

Put that on a p/e of 10 = \u00a320m or 5p. But that is just the start, and proves the model. As that ramps up, so does the income. Then there is UK to follow. Then other areas. These will follow quicker once the test is accredited and commercially available. However the real value will be when a larger fish decides it wants the tech and future revenues. An organisation that  already has the labs and hospital contracts doesn't need to be a virtual model dependent on franchisees. It could take the whole operation in house. I was in Genmark when Roche decided it wanted it, for $1.8bn. $500m would be \u00a31 a share. $100 is small change to big pharma but would still be 20p here.",

I\u2019m now wondering how long it would take a UK partner to get this test through the various regulatory hurdles in order to get this into a live clinical setting, lab or LFT driven\u2026 NHS AS has chosen the US market to launch the test due to the much narrower timescales in achieving a market ready test via. a LDT accreditation. Once achieved he is in a much stronger position to approach a partner of the likes of Siemens or Abbott in the task of attaining UKCA accreditation. This would likely involve licensing our tech to enable one of these types of Companies to run the required clinical trials on their proprietary platforms. Such trials are much more defined, time consuming and costly than a LDT. As such, the NHS, whilst an obvious goal, remains secondary to the US trial. Remember, we\u2019re running with a licensing model here. IMHO VV",

Since validation should not take as long as this, maybe it's fair to draw some conclusions. (See point 1) Notice there's been a few chunky sells today.

Updates would be most welcome from; 5 Nov 25 RNS: Letter of Intent (\"LOI\") with a leading medical diagnostic services provider (the \"Provider\") acting in partnership with the NHS. The LOI covers the verification and validation of the Company's CIZ1B biomarker test with a NHS Foundation Trust partner in state-of-the-art laboratories which may lead to the Provider being appointed as the Company's exclusive UK supplier of the CIZ1B test. \u00b7 Commercial Launch: In August 2025, following progress achieved at their pathfinder lab, BIO realigned their accreditation and market launch strategy with a new multi-site clinical laboratory, enabling a much wider co-ordinated and comprehensive campaign to roll out the CIZ1B biomarker test in North America. Omni Health Diagnostics (\"Omni\") announced in September 2025 that the roll out programme will be nationwide in at least six states with potential further expansion. This demonstrates how BIO intends to scale its operations to meet expected demand in the USA. \u00b7 Moffitt Cancer Center Collaboration: On 9 September 2024, the Group was selected by Moffitt Cancer Center (\"Moffitt\"), Florida's leading cancer hospital, to test patients with suspicious lung nodules in a clinical evaluation using the Group's proprietary CIZ1B biomarker assay. Since then, Moffitt has been recruiting patients and collecting blood samples to ship to the University of York. We expect samples to be received shortly and testing to begin in Q4 2025. This important study to test patients for the presence of the CIZ1B Biomarker is part of a major clinical evaluation for suspected lung cancer patients. Short term finances seem secure with the financial support from Frazer Lang and the 'guaranteed' royalties  of $2.4M to be paid by December this year ($530K received by Nov 2025)",

Which can mean either that things aren't going well or are going well. I'm guessing that Ciz Bio will be making good progress unless they've got a team together just a mess around for a laugh - and the yanks don't do that. They like their $$$ too much. Metaphorically  speaking (certainly not in a political way) it seems they've got a Donald Trump in charge of their operations and we've got Keir Starmer.",

          "content": "Courtesy of Bubbles223 on IMM. Just found it an interesting read and most of it related to IMM which I am not invested in. When a biotech is getting close to signing a partnership, it almost never says so directly \u2014 but it always leaves a trail of signals. Investors who follow deal\u2011making watch these patterns closely because they tend to repeat across companies and across years. Here\u2019s a deeper look at how companies signal a deal is close, with each signal broken down into what it really means behind the scenes. \ud83d\udd0d The Subtle (but Reliable) Signals a Deal Is Near 1. Senior leadership suddenly becomes very visible CEO and CSO attending partnering events together Multiple executives presenting instead of just one Frequent interviews or investor updates When a deal is early, business development teams handle it. When a deal is close, executives must be present because final terms require top\u2011level approval. 2. The company attends high\u2011level partnering conferences JP Morgan Healthcare Conference BIO International Convention Biotech Showcase in San Francisco These events are where final negotiations often happen. Companies don\u2019t send their full leadership team unless they expect meaningful progress. 3. Language in press releases becomes more specific Look for shifts like: \u201cWe are in discussions\u201d \u2192 \u201cadvanced discussions with multiple parties\u201d \u201cExploring options\u201d \u2192 \u201cdetailed due diligence underway\u201d \u201cEngagement ongoing\u201d \u2192 \u201cmultiple confidentiality agreements signed\u201d Public companies choose their words carefully. When the language tightens, it\u2019s intentional. 4. Silence \u2014 the good kind Fewer scientific updates No new exploratory programs announced Reduced commentary on timelines When a deal is close, companies often go quiet because: they\u2019re under NDA they don\u2019t want to disrupt negotiations they\u2019re preparing coordinated announcements with the partner Silence is often louder than words. 5. The company begins referencing \u201cvalue inflection\u201d events \u201cTransformational opportunity\u201d \u201cStrategic partnership discussions\u201d \u201cMultiple interested parties\u201d This is coded language for: We\u2019re negotiating, and we want the market to know something big is coming. \ud83e\udde0 The strongest signal of all When a company says it is: meeting multiple top\u201110 pharma companies, attending JP Morgan with its full leadership team, and has multiple confidentiality agreements signed, that confidentiality agreements signed, This is a sign that a deal is in the late stages.",

(And I've stated it in the past) Even if they do overcome the (obviously problematic) obstacle to commercialisation, what does that actually look like? If they get the PR right , it opens to a great fanfair r in the US, share price (MC) spikes to maybe 15-25 mill market cap. Then what? Sales are predicted to be very slow...so share price slumps back to maybe 10mill MC. So what happens then? I predict a massive fundraiser in the UK to get the ball rolling over here and in Europe. At the same time Alan Symms is definitely not the leader to take this forward imo. He has no charisma or energy. So there's a share price that is halved or three quartered by a fundraiser. Probably another spike as there's news of a partner in the UK. Share price falls back...then what? (Probably a year or two years to get it going in the UK... While in the USA sales go at snails pace) In the meantime there will be other products coming to market that supersede it. Probably at some point the US company is taken out. Maybe Ciz UK is taken out for peanuts. And that's how I see the long term!",

They have therefore realigned their accreditation and market launch plans to the new multi-site clinical laboratory to enable a much wider co-ordinated and comprehensive campaign to roll out the CIZ1B biomarker test in North America, to help detect early-stage lung cancer. This new agreement with a significantly larger multi-site clinical laboratory demonstrates how BIO intends to scale its operations throughout the USA. \"BIO's commitment to our strong partnership is also evident by the receipt of an early advance royalty payment which means the Company has now received US$525,000.

As for the UK Plc, there are only four of them. AS predominantly full time, DC has a research lab to run aswell, and then two part-timers so progress from the licence holder isn\u2019t going to be as quick as desired, I can\u2019t see them expanding the team to expedite progress otherwise this would have been done previously\u2026 In terms of criticism, there are a few key weaknesses imv\u2026and shared by most I assume\u2026 1. Commercial directorship - pace could be increased in terms of other regions. Validation processes will always take time but non-scientific elements you would expect could have been expedited. 2. Lack of comms - age old issue which hasn\u2019t improved. Still using Directors Talk which is very limited, no Q&A, no attempt to engage new investors, 3-4 trades a day the result of lack of visibility. Assumption is they are relying on milestones to realise value but still feels way too passive. 3. Economic with the truth - not unique to Ciz by any stretch, communicate after issue has been resolved - there are a couple of occasions where goalposts have changed but with no explanation\u2026namely mAb production from Proteogenix to BBI and then the move from iGenomeDX to OmnihealthDX, the pathfinder narrative didn\u2019t feel accurate. You\u2019d expect things to go wrong / need to change direction, but would be beneficial if there was a more honest dialogue. As an investor it\u2019s hard to argue too much with you OldMoot given SP is languishing at 1.5p and MC at \u00a35mn is way below the IPOd \u00a322mn\u2026. so far, it\u2019s fundamentally underperformed and purely from an investors perspective you\u2019d clearly have been better off invested elsewhere. (There\u2019s no doubting the company aim is a very worthwhile one and hope it flies globally to help improve prognosis of those with a positive LC diagnosis.) Anyway, given CLIA accreditation, launch, grant funding, UK LoI conversion (hopefully) etc\u2026 are \u201cnear term\u201d hoping Q1 \u201826 finally sees value being realised\u2026 it\u2019s been a painful wait but fundamentals still seem positive (to me at least)\u2026 (hopefully no RNS before Christmas\u2026) Merry Christmas all!",

And Ciz UK bulling about April launch right up to the date -when they obviously knew. Can't believe a word regarding timelines. They just throw words into the air to keep it trundling along. Comms are THE PITS. Could be this year for launch, could be next, could be never if it's not validated properly. I'm expecting more of these mini fundraisers that have been going on .

Since validation should not take as long as this, maybe it's fair to draw some conclusions. (See point 1) Notice there's been a few chunky sells today. Hard to gauge what is going on behind the scenes with such a dreadful company regarding shareholder respect",

Updates would be most welcome from; 5 Nov 25 RNS: Letter of Intent (\"LOI\") with a leading medical diagnostic services provider (the \"Provider\") acting in partnership with the NHS. The LOI covers the verification and validation of the Company's CIZ1B biomarker test with a NHS Foundation Trust partner in state-of-the-art laboratories which may lead to the Provider being appointed as the Company's exclusive UK supplier of the CIZ1B test. \u00b7 Commercial Launch: In August 2025, following progress achieved at their pathfinder lab, BIO realigned their accreditation and market launch strategy with a new multi-site clinical laboratory, enabling a much wider co-ordinated and comprehensive campaign to roll out the CIZ1B biomarker test in North America. Omni Health Diagnostics (\"Omni\") announced in September 2025 that the roll out programme will be nationwide in at least six states with potential further expansion. This demonstrates how BIO intends to scale its operations to meet expected demand in the USA. \u00b7 Moffitt Cancer Center Collaboration: On 9 September 2024, the Group was selected by Moffitt Cancer Center (\"Moffitt\"), Florida's leading cancer hospital, to test patients with suspicious lung nodules in a clinical evaluation using the Group's proprietary CIZ1B biomarker assay. Since then, Moffitt has been recruiting patients and collecting blood samples to ship to the University of York. We expect samples to be received shortly and testing to begin in Q4 2025. This important study to test patients for the presence of the CIZ1B Biomarker is part of a major clinical evaluation for suspected lung cancer patients. Short term finances seem secure with the financial support from Frazer Lang and the 'guaranteed' royalties  of $2.4M to be paid by December this year ($530K received by Nov 2025)",

          "content": "Courtesy of Bubbles223 on IMM. Just found it an interesting read and most of it related to IMM which I am not invested in. When a biotech is getting close to signing a partnership, it almost never says so directly \u2014 but it always leaves a trail of signals. Investors who follow deal\u2011making watch these patterns closely because they tend to repeat across companies and across years. Here\u2019s a deeper look at how companies signal a deal is close, with each signal broken down into what it really means behind the scenes. \ud83d\udd0d The Subtle (but Reliable) Signals a Deal Is Near 1. Senior leadership suddenly becomes very visible CEO and CSO attending partnering events together Multiple executives presenting instead of just one Frequent interviews or investor updates When a deal is early, business development teams handle it. When a deal is close, executives must be present because final terms require top\u2011level approval. 2. The company attends high\u2011level partnering conferences JP Morgan Healthcare Conference BIO International Convention Biotech Showcase in San Francisco These events are where final negotiations often happen. Companies don\u2019t send their full leadership team unless they expect meaningful progress. 3. Language in press releases becomes more specific Look for shifts like: \u201cWe are in discussions\u201d \u2192 \u201cadvanced discussions with multiple parties\u201d \u201cExploring options\u201d \u2192 \u201cdetailed due diligence underway\u201d \u201cEngagement ongoing\u201d \u2192 \u201cmultiple confidentiality agreements signed\u201d Public companies choose their words carefully. When the language tightens, it\u2019s intentional. 4. Silence \u2014 the good kind Fewer scientific updates No new exploratory programs announced Reduced commentary on timelines When a deal is close, companies often go quiet because: they\u2019re under NDA they don\u2019t want to disrupt negotiations they\u2019re preparing coordinated announcements with the partner Silence is often louder than words. 5. The company begins referencing \u201cvalue inflection\u201d events \u201cTransformational opportunity\u201d \u201cStrategic partnership discussions\u201d \u201cMultiple interested parties\u201d This is coded language for: We\u2019re negotiating, and we want the market to know something big is coming. \ud83e\udde0 The strongest signal of all When a company says it is: meeting multiple top\u201110 pharma companies, attending JP Morgan with its full leadership team, and has multiple confidentiality agreements signed, that confidentiality agreements signed, This is a sign that a deal is in the late stages.",

(And I've stated it in the past) Even if they do overcome the (obviously problematic) obstacle to commercialisation, what does that actually look like? If they get the PR right , it opens to a great fanfair r in the US, share price (MC) spikes to maybe 15-25 mill market cap. Then what? Sales are predicted to be very slow...so share price slumps back to maybe 10mill MC. So what happens then? I predict a massive fundraiser in the UK to get the ball rolling over here and in Europe. At the same time Alan Symms is definitely not the leader to take this forward imo. He has no charisma or energy. So there's a share price that is halved or three quartered by a fundraiser. Probably another spike as there's news of a partner in the UK. Share price falls back...then what? (Probably a year or two years to get it going in the UK... While in the USA sales go at snails pace) In the meantime there will be other products coming to market that supersede it. Probably at some point the US company is taken out. Maybe Ciz UK is taken out for peanuts. And that's how I see the long term!",

Following the progress made by their pathfinder clinical laboratory, BIO's strategy has developed to more appropriately reflect the large market opportunity they are seeing for the Company's CIZ1B biomarker test in North America.  They have therefore realigned their accreditation and market launch plans to the new multi-site clinical laboratory to enable a much wider co-ordinated and comprehensive campaign to roll out the CIZ1B biomarker test in North America, to help detect early-stage lung cancer. This new agreement with a significantly larger multi-site clinical laboratory demonstrates how BIO intends to scale its operations throughout the USA. \"BIO's commitment to our strong partnership is also evident by the receipt of an early advance royalty payment which means the Company has now received US$525,000. We have since agreed to a more balanced payment schedule through to the end of 2026 which will see the remainder of the advance royalty fees being received by Cizzle Biotechnology earlier. \"I look forward to announcing further updates on BIO's commercial progress in North America and the Company's strategy to make its CIZ1B biomarker test available globally in due course.\"",

As for the UK Plc, there are only four of them. AS predominantly full time, DC has a research lab to run aswell, and then two part-timers so progress from the licence holder isn\u2019t going to be as quick as desired, I can\u2019t see them expanding the team to expedite progress otherwise this would have been done previously\u2026 In terms of criticism, there are a few key weaknesses imv\u2026and shared by most I assume\u2026 1. Commercial directorship - pace could be increased in terms of other regions. Validation processes will always take time but non-scientific elements you would expect could have been expedited. 2. Lack of comms - age old issue which hasn\u2019t improved. Still using Directors Talk which is very limited, no Q&A, no attempt to engage new investors, 3-4 trades a day the result of lack of visibility. Assumption is they are relying on milestones to realise value but still feels way too passive. 3. Economic with the truth - not unique to Ciz by any stretch, communicate after issue has been resolved - there are a couple of occasions where goalposts have changed but with no explanation\u2026namely mAb production from Proteogenix to BBI and then the move from iGenomeDX to OmnihealthDX, the pathfinder narrative didn\u2019t feel accurate. You\u2019d expect things to go wrong / need to change direction, but would be beneficial if there was a more honest dialogue. As an investor it\u2019s hard to argue too much with you OldMoot given SP is languishing at 1.5p and MC at \u00a35mn is way below the IPOd \u00a322mn\u2026. so far, it\u2019s fundamentally underperformed and purely from an investors perspective you\u2019d clearly have been better off invested elsewhere. (There\u2019s no doubting the company aim is a very worthwhile one and hope it flies globally to help improve prognosis of those with a positive LC diagnosis.) Anyway, given CLIA accreditation, launch, grant funding, UK LoI conversion (hopefully) etc\u2026 are \u201cnear term\u201d hoping Q1 \u201826 finally sees value being realised\u2026 it\u2019s been a painful wait but fundamentals still seem positive (to me at least)\u2026 (hopefully no RNS before Christmas\u2026) Merry Christmas all!",

Since validation should not take as long as this, maybe it's fair to draw some conclusions. (See point 1) Notice there's been a few chunky sells today.

Updates would be most welcome from; 5 Nov 25 RNS: Letter of Intent (\"LOI\") with a leading medical diagnostic services provider (the \"Provider\") acting in partnership with the NHS. The LOI covers the verification and validation of the Company's CIZ1B biomarker test with a NHS Foundation Trust partner in state-of-the-art laboratories which may lead to the Provider being appointed as the Company's exclusive UK supplier of the CIZ1B test. \u00b7 Commercial Launch: In August 2025, following progress achieved at their pathfinder lab, BIO realigned their accreditation and market launch strategy with a new multi-site clinical laboratory, enabling a much wider co-ordinated and comprehensive campaign to roll out the CIZ1B biomarker test in North America. Omni Health Diagnostics (\"Omni\") announced in September 2025 that the roll out programme will be nationwide in at least six states with potential further expansion. This demonstrates how BIO intends to scale its operations to meet expected demand in the USA. \u00b7 Moffitt Cancer Center Collaboration: On 9 September 2024, the Group was selected by Moffitt Cancer Center (\"Moffitt\"), Florida's leading cancer hospital, to test patients with suspicious lung nodules in a clinical evaluation using the Group's proprietary CIZ1B biomarker assay. Since then, Moffitt has been recruiting patients and collecting blood samples to ship to the University of York. We expect samples to be received shortly and testing to begin in Q4 2025. This important study to test patients for the presence of the CIZ1B Biomarker is part of a major clinical evaluation for suspected lung cancer patients. Short term finances seem secure with the financial support from Frazer Lang and the 'guaranteed' royalties  of $2.4M to be paid by December this year ($530K received by Nov 2025)",

The Company has a strong patent portfolio and continues to seek additional protection in other key markets globally. In addition to its existing patent coverage in the USA, a further application is likely to be granted\nby\nthe United States patent and trademark office in due course.\nThe patent 'Use of a fibrinogen capture agent to detect a CIZ1B variant' concerns a two-step test format developed by Cizzle at the University of York. This test format is licensed to\nCizzle Bio Inc (\"BIO\") for use in North America and\nthe Caribbean and these new patents will strengthen BIO's position in commercialising the Company's innovative and proprietary technology.\nBackground\nThe discovery and development of the CIZ1B biomarker test is the product of work by Professor Dawn Coverley, the Company's founder and CSO, and her research team at the University of York. Initially supported by both UK Research and Industry and Charity sector research grants it has been the ambition to translate the laboratory findings into products that benefit future cancer patients in the UK, and elsewhere around the world.\nCizzle Biotechnology\n's\npatent portfolio and technology know-how enhances the Company's ability to deliver it's global\ncommercial strategy to licence globally its proprietary test for the CIZ1B biomarker for use in the early detection of lung cancer. The Company's first licence agreement with BIO for North America and the Caribbean, has led to partnerships between BIO and specialist clinical laboratories and hospitals, to enable market penetration that makes the test available to as many clinicians and patients as possible.\nCizzle Biotechnology\nalso has been granted patent protection from the European Patent Office and is now focussed on securing partnerships with accredited facilities in the UK and Europe\nincluding the NHS.\nThis aligns well with the current NHS cancer plan which aims to dramatically improve cancer survival by increasing the proportion of cancers diagnosed at stages 1 and 2 from half to three-quarters by 2028. This shift towards earlier diagnosis is expected to save 55,000 additional lives per year by 2028. The plan focuses on improving access to diagnosis and treatment, raising awareness of cancer symptoms, and increasing the number of cancers identified through screening, including personalised and risk-stratified approaches.\nCommenting, Dawn Coverley, Chief Scientific Officer of Cizzle Biotechnology, said:\n\"The granted patents that cover the specific test format that we are taking to market with our partners in North America and elsewhere will protect the Company's offering and add an additional level of security for our shareholders. They help to ensure that the Company's innovative and\ncommercially scalable\nCIZ1B biomarker\ntest will bring benefit to cancer patients, through the roll out of early detection programs.\"\nEnquiries:\nCizzle Biotechnology Holdings plc\nVia IFC Advisory\nAllan Syms (Executive Chairman)\nAllenby Capital Limited\n+44(0) 20 3328 5656\nJohn Depasquale / Piers Shimwell (Corporate Finance)\nAmrit Nahal (Sales and Corporate Broking)\nIFC Advisory Limited\n+44(0) 20 3934 6630\nTim Metcalfe\nFlorence Staton\nAbout Cizzle Biotechnology\nThe CIZ1B biomarker is a naturally occurring variant of the cell nuclear protein CIZ1, which is linked with the preservation of epigenetic integrity. CIZ1B is highly associated with the presence of early-stage lung cancer and can be measured in small quantities of blood. The company has developed CIZ1B into a non-invasive, cost-effective blood test to help in the early detection of lung cancer and has now entered commercial royalty-bearing arrangements to license its proprietary technology, and into collaborations with centres of excellence in cancer care. Cizzle was admitted to the Standard segment of the main market of the London Stock Exchange in May 2021.\nFor more information, please see\nhttps://cizzlebiotechnology.com\nYou can also follow the Company through its twitter account @CizzlePlc and on LinkedIn.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

This will be at 1.4p which is where we are roughly now, and that will convert into 17,857,142 new shares. If, however, he decides not to convert, there are no associated fees or interest payments due to him from CIZ. He may also decide not to have the money returned in which case, from 5th November 2025 RNS \u201cPrior to 31 March 2026 the Company does not intend to incur any debt (other than in the ordinary course of business) or make any adjustments to its share capital while the Additional Notes are outstanding.\u201d It will become a debt but there will be no further dilution. The note which was announced in May 2025 however was for \u00a3150000 and again could be converted into new ordinary shares at 1.4p any time up to 24 months from announcement. That would be 10,714,285 shares potentially with I am sure the same stipulations as the later loan notes 5th November 2025. The Company has also issued warrants to Frazer Lang over 12,500,000 Ordinary Shares in the Company at an exercise price of 2p, to be exercised within two years of the date of issue. So, in total that is around a potential 41,071,428 shares that could be issued taking the Fraser Lang to 19.48% of the issued share capital two years from the dates of announcement. I am wondering if this is why we have been hovering around here, waiting basically on any dilution from Lang and we have until the 31st of March 2026 potentially to know. New tax year a week after that and hopefully we swing into action a little wiser.",

I can see there might be other factors - possibly  government shutdown slowing them down and some states taking longer to approve - New York slower typically and assume you\u2019d want all lined up before launching. Also didn\u2019t seem like Omnihealth DX were in a position to hit the ground running do could see that needing more time (aswell as getting up to speed after the iGenome handover). May be a funding question still\u2026not convinced payments to Cizzle plc are on schedule and may be why they\u2019ve got the Lang safety net. However, for AS to suggest it\u2019s live by year end\u2026you wouldn\u2019t do that unless you thought you were nearly there! Re comms\u2026 I just don\u2019t see it improving. A quarterly Directors Talk interview where the first 5 mins are repetitive is clearly inadequate and with no effort at all to extend interest / investor base. The cause is utterly admirable but given their approach to investor engagement, AS is talking to the exact same audience each time, so no benefit in revisiting the context each time. Having said this, AS isn\u2019t naive so I wonder if they are working to an end game and therefore shareholder engagement is less critical than in other cases\u2026there again it was this bad 3 years ago\u2026 I\u2019m thinking they are more likely to be acquired once CLIA approved as should be a material change in both value and opportunity. BIO reckon they are worth $70mn while the UK licence holder is at a mere \u00a35mn, should be easy pickings. Could also see BIO seeking to go public / seek partner investment to accelerate roll out as current speed isn\u2019t adequate and the US are far less pedestrian than the UK.

          "content": "Courtesy of Bubbles223 on IMM. Just found it an interesting read and most of it related to IMM which I am not invested in. When a biotech is getting close to signing a partnership, it almost never says so directly \u2014 but it always leaves a trail of signals. Investors who follow deal\u2011making watch these patterns closely because they tend to repeat across companies and across years. Here\u2019s a deeper look at how companies signal a deal is close, with each signal broken down into what it really means behind the scenes. \ud83d\udd0d The Subtle (but Reliable) Signals a Deal Is Near 1. Senior leadership suddenly becomes very visible CEO and CSO attending partnering events together Multiple executives presenting instead of just one Frequent interviews or investor updates When a deal is early, business development teams handle it. When a deal is close, executives must be present because final terms require top\u2011level approval. 2. The company attends high\u2011level partnering conferences JP Morgan Healthcare Conference BIO International Convention Biotech Showcase in San Francisco These events are where final negotiations often happen. Companies don\u2019t send their full leadership team unless they expect meaningful progress. 3. Language in press releases becomes more specific Look for shifts like: \u201cWe are in discussions\u201d \u2192 \u201cadvanced discussions with multiple parties\u201d \u201cExploring options\u201d \u2192 \u201cdetailed due diligence underway\u201d \u201cEngagement ongoing\u201d \u2192 \u201cmultiple confidentiality agreements signed\u201d Public companies choose their words carefully. When the language tightens, it\u2019s intentional. 4. Silence \u2014 the good kind Fewer scientific updates No new exploratory programs announced Reduced commentary on timelines When a deal is close, companies often go quiet because: they\u2019re under NDA they don\u2019t want to disrupt negotiations they\u2019re preparing coordinated announcements with the partner Silence is often louder than words. 5. The company begins referencing \u201cvalue inflection\u201d events \u201cTransformational opportunity\u201d \u201cStrategic partnership discussions\u201d \u201cMultiple interested parties\u201d This is coded language for: We\u2019re negotiating, and we want the market to know something big is coming. \ud83e\udde0 The strongest signal of all When a company says it is: meeting multiple top\u201110 pharma companies, attending JP Morgan with its full leadership team, and has multiple confidentiality agreements signed, that confidentiality agreements signed, This is a sign that a deal is in the late stages.",

(And I've stated it in the past) Even if they do overcome the (obviously problematic) obstacle to commercialisation, what does that actually look like? If they get the PR right , it opens to a great fanfair r in the US, share price (MC) spikes to maybe 15-25 mill market cap. Then what? Sales are predicted to be very slow...so share price slumps back to maybe 10mill MC. So what happens then? I predict a massive fundraiser in the UK to get the ball rolling over here and in Europe. At the same time Alan Symms is definitely not the leader to take this forward imo. He has no charisma or energy. So there's a share price that is halved or three quartered by a fundraiser. Probably another spike as there's news of a partner in the UK. Share price falls back...then what? (Probably a year or two years to get it going in the UK... While in the USA sales go at snails pace) In the meantime there will be other products coming to market that supersede it. Probably at some point the US company is taken out. Maybe Ciz UK is taken out for peanuts. And that's how I see the long term!",

They have therefore realigned their accreditation and market launch plans to the new multi-site clinical laboratory to enable a much wider co-ordinated and comprehensive campaign to roll out the CIZ1B biomarker test in North America, to help detect early-stage lung cancer. This new agreement with a significantly larger multi-site clinical laboratory demonstrates how BIO intends to scale its operations throughout the USA. \"BIO's commitment to our strong partnership is also evident by the receipt of an early advance royalty payment which means the Company has now received US$525,000. We have since agreed to a more balanced payment schedule through to the end of 2026 which will see the remainder of the advance royalty fees being received by Cizzle Biotechnology earlier. \"I look forward to announcing further updates on BIO's commercial progress in North America and the Company's strategy to make its CIZ1B biomarker test available globally in due course.\"",

As for the UK Plc, there are only four of them. AS predominantly full time, DC has a research lab to run aswell, and then two part-timers so progress from the licence holder isn\u2019t going to be as quick as desired, I can\u2019t see them expanding the team to expedite progress otherwise this would have been done previously\u2026 In terms of criticism, there are a few key weaknesses imv\u2026and shared by most I assume\u2026 1. Commercial directorship - pace could be increased in terms of other regions. Validation processes will always take time but non-scientific elements you would expect could have been expedited. 2. Lack of comms - age old issue which hasn\u2019t improved. Still using Directors Talk which is very limited, no Q&A, no attempt to engage new investors, 3-4 trades a day the result of lack of visibility. Assumption is they are relying on milestones to realise value but still feels way too passive. 3. Economic with the truth - not unique to Ciz by any stretch, communicate after issue has been resolved - there are a couple of occasions where goalposts have changed but with no explanation\u2026namely mAb production from Proteogenix to BBI and then the move from iGenomeDX to OmnihealthDX, the pathfinder narrative didn\u2019t feel accurate. You\u2019d expect things to go wrong / need to change direction, but would be beneficial if there was a more honest dialogue. As an investor it\u2019s hard to argue too much with you OldMoot given SP is languishing at 1.5p and MC at \u00a35mn is way below the IPOd \u00a322mn\u2026. so far, it\u2019s fundamentally underperformed and purely from an investors perspective you\u2019d clearly have been better off invested elsewhere. (There\u2019s no doubting the company aim is a very worthwhile one and hope it flies globally to help improve prognosis of those with a positive LC diagnosis.) Anyway, given CLIA accreditation, launch, grant funding, UK LoI conversion (hopefully) etc\u2026 are \u201cnear term\u201d hoping Q1 \u201826 finally sees value being realised\u2026 it\u2019s been a painful wait but fundamentals still seem positive (to me at least)\u2026 (hopefully no RNS before Christmas\u2026) Merry Christmas all!",

And Ciz UK bulling about April launch right up to the date -when they obviously knew. Can't believe a word regarding timelines. They just throw words into the air to keep it trundling along. Comms are THE PITS. Could be this year for launch, could be next, could be never if it's not validated properly. I'm expecting more of these mini fundraisers that have been going on .

Since validation should not take as long as this, maybe it's fair to draw some conclusions. (See point 1) Notice there's been a few chunky sells today.

Updates would be most welcome from; 5 Nov 25 RNS: Letter of Intent (\"LOI\") with a leading medical diagnostic services provider (the \"Provider\") acting in partnership with the NHS. The LOI covers the verification and validation of the Company's CIZ1B biomarker test with a NHS Foundation Trust partner in state-of-the-art laboratories which may lead to the Provider being appointed as the Company's exclusive UK supplier of the CIZ1B test. \u00b7 Commercial Launch: In August 2025, following progress achieved at their pathfinder lab, BIO realigned their accreditation and market launch strategy with a new multi-site clinical laboratory, enabling a much wider co-ordinated and comprehensive campaign to roll out the CIZ1B biomarker test in North America. Omni Health Diagnostics (\"Omni\") announced in September 2025 that the roll out programme will be nationwide in at least six states with potential further expansion. This demonstrates how BIO intends to scale its operations to meet expected demand in the USA. \u00b7 Moffitt Cancer Center Collaboration: On 9 September 2024, the Group was selected by Moffitt Cancer Center (\"Moffitt\"), Florida's leading cancer hospital, to test patients with suspicious lung nodules in a clinical evaluation using the Group's proprietary CIZ1B biomarker assay. Since then, Moffitt has been recruiting patients and collecting blood samples to ship to the University of York. We expect samples to be received shortly and testing to begin in Q4 2025. This important study to test patients for the presence of the CIZ1B Biomarker is part of a major clinical evaluation for suspected lung cancer patients. Short term finances seem secure with the financial support from Frazer Lang and the 'guaranteed' royalties  of $2.4M to be paid by December this year ($530K received by Nov 2025)",

This will be at 1.4p which is where we are roughly now, and that will convert into 17,857,142 new shares. If, however, he decides not to convert, there are no associated fees or interest payments due to him from CIZ. He may also decide not to have the money returned in which case, from 5th November 2025 RNS \u201cPrior to 31 March 2026 the Company does not intend to incur any debt (other than in the ordinary course of business) or make any adjustments to its share capital while the Additional Notes are outstanding.\u201d It will become a debt but there will be no further dilution. The note which was announced in May 2025 however was for \u00a3150000 and again could be converted into new ordinary shares at 1.4p any time up to 24 months from announcement. That would be 10,714,285 shares potentially with I am sure the same stipulations as the later loan notes 5th November 2025. The Company has also issued warrants to Frazer Lang over 12,500,000 Ordinary Shares in the Company at an exercise price of 2p, to be exercised within two years of the date of issue. So, in total that is around a potential 41,071,428 shares that could be issued taking the Fraser Lang to 19.48% of the issued share capital two years from the dates of announcement. I am wondering if this is why we have been hovering around here, waiting basically on any dilution from Lang and we have until the 31st of March 2026 potentially to know. New tax year a week after that and hopefully we swing into action a little wiser.",

A quarterly Directors Talk interview where the first 5 mins are repetitive is clearly inadequate and with no effort at all to extend interest / investor base. The cause is utterly admirable but given their approach to investor engagement, AS is talking to the exact same audience each time, so no benefit in revisiting the context each time. Having said this, AS isn\u2019t naive so I wonder if they are working to an end game and therefore shareholder engagement is less critical than in other cases\u2026there again it was this bad 3 years ago\u2026 I\u2019m thinking they are more likely to be acquired once CLIA approved as should be a material change in both value and opportunity.

          "content": "Courtesy of Bubbles223 on IMM. Just found it an interesting read and most of it related to IMM which I am not invested in. When a biotech is getting close to signing a partnership, it almost never says so directly \u2014 but it always leaves a trail of signals. Investors who follow deal\u2011making watch these patterns closely because they tend to repeat across companies and across years. Here\u2019s a deeper look at how companies signal a deal is close, with each signal broken down into what it really means behind the scenes. \ud83d\udd0d The Subtle (but Reliable) Signals a Deal Is Near 1. Senior leadership suddenly becomes very visible CEO and CSO attending partnering events together Multiple executives presenting instead of just one Frequent interviews or investor updates When a deal is early, business development teams handle it. When a deal is close, executives must be present because final terms require top\u2011level approval. 2. The company attends high\u2011level partnering conferences JP Morgan Healthcare Conference BIO International Convention Biotech Showcase in San Francisco These events are where final negotiations often happen. Companies don\u2019t send their full leadership team unless they expect meaningful progress. 3. Language in press releases becomes more specific Look for shifts like: \u201cWe are in discussions\u201d \u2192 \u201cadvanced discussions with multiple parties\u201d \u201cExploring options\u201d \u2192 \u201cdetailed due diligence underway\u201d \u201cEngagement ongoing\u201d \u2192 \u201cmultiple confidentiality agreements signed\u201d Public companies choose their words carefully. When the language tightens, it\u2019s intentional. 4. Silence \u2014 the good kind Fewer scientific updates No new exploratory programs announced Reduced commentary on timelines When a deal is close, companies often go quiet because: they\u2019re under NDA they don\u2019t want to disrupt negotiations they\u2019re preparing coordinated announcements with the partner Silence is often louder than words. 5. The company begins referencing \u201cvalue inflection\u201d events \u201cTransformational opportunity\u201d \u201cStrategic partnership discussions\u201d \u201cMultiple interested parties\u201d This is coded language for: We\u2019re negotiating, and we want the market to know something big is coming. \ud83e\udde0 The strongest signal of all When a company says it is: meeting multiple top\u201110 pharma companies, attending JP Morgan with its full leadership team, and has multiple confidentiality agreements signed, that confidentiality agreements signed, This is a sign that a deal is in the late stages.",

(And I've stated it in the past) Even if they do overcome the (obviously problematic) obstacle to commercialisation, what does that actually look like? If they get the PR right , it opens to a great fanfair r in the US, share price (MC) spikes to maybe 15-25 mill market cap. Then what? Sales are predicted to be very slow...so share price slumps back to maybe 10mill MC. So what happens then? I predict a massive fundraiser in the UK to get the ball rolling over here and in Europe. At the same time Alan Symms is definitely not the leader to take this forward imo. He has no charisma or energy. So there's a share price that is halved or three quartered by a fundraiser. Probably another spike as there's news of a partner in the UK. Share price falls back...then what? (Probably a year or two years to get it going in the UK... While in the USA sales go at snails pace) In the meantime there will be other products coming to market that supersede it. Probably at some point the US company is taken out. Maybe Ciz UK is taken out for peanuts. And that's how I see the long term!",

Following the progress made by their pathfinder clinical laboratory, BIO's strategy has developed to more appropriately reflect the large market opportunity they are seeing for the Company's CIZ1B biomarker test in North America.  They have therefore realigned their accreditation and market launch plans to the new multi-site clinical laboratory to enable a much wider co-ordinated and comprehensive campaign to roll out the CIZ1B biomarker test in North America, to help detect early-stage lung cancer. This new agreement with a significantly larger multi-site clinical laboratory demonstrates how BIO intends to scale its operations throughout the USA. \"BIO's commitment to our strong partnership is also evident by the receipt of an early advance royalty payment which means the Company has now received US$525,000. We have since agreed to a more balanced payment schedule through to the end of 2026 which will see the remainder of the advance royalty fees being received by Cizzle Biotechnology earlier. \"I look forward to announcing further updates on BIO's commercial progress in North America and the Company's strategy to make its CIZ1B biomarker test available globally in due course.\"",

As for the UK Plc, there are only four of them. AS predominantly full time, DC has a research lab to run aswell, and then two part-timers so progress from the licence holder isn\u2019t going to be as quick as desired, I can\u2019t see them expanding the team to expedite progress otherwise this would have been done previously\u2026 In terms of criticism, there are a few key weaknesses imv\u2026and shared by most I assume\u2026 1. Commercial directorship - pace could be increased in terms of other regions. Validation processes will always take time but non-scientific elements you would expect could have been expedited. 2. Lack of comms - age old issue which hasn\u2019t improved. Still using Directors Talk which is very limited, no Q&A, no attempt to engage new investors, 3-4 trades a day the result of lack of visibility. Assumption is they are relying on milestones to realise value but still feels way too passive. 3. Economic with the truth - not unique to Ciz by any stretch, communicate after issue has been resolved - there are a couple of occasions where goalposts have changed but with no explanation\u2026namely mAb production from Proteogenix to BBI and then the move from iGenomeDX to OmnihealthDX, the pathfinder narrative didn\u2019t feel accurate. You\u2019d expect things to go wrong / need to change direction, but would be beneficial if there was a more honest dialogue. As an investor it\u2019s hard to argue too much with you OldMoot given SP is languishing at 1.5p and MC at \u00a35mn is way below the IPOd \u00a322mn\u2026. so far, it\u2019s fundamentally underperformed and purely from an investors perspective you\u2019d clearly have been better off invested elsewhere. (There\u2019s no doubting the company aim is a very worthwhile one and hope it flies globally to help improve prognosis of those with a positive LC diagnosis.) Anyway, given CLIA accreditation, launch, grant funding, UK LoI conversion (hopefully) etc\u2026 are \u201cnear term\u201d hoping Q1 \u201826 finally sees value being realised\u2026 it\u2019s been a painful wait but fundamentals still seem positive (to me at least)\u2026 (hopefully no RNS before Christmas\u2026) Merry Christmas all!",

And Ciz UK bulling about April launch right up to the date -when they obviously knew. Can't believe a word regarding timelines. They just throw words into the air to keep it trundling along. Comms are THE PITS. Could be this year for launch, could be next, could be never if it's not validated properly. I'm expecting more of these mini fundraisers that have been going on . It may all be going swimmingly, but it may not. Who knows where the company that cannot tell the truth on timelines.",

Since validation should not take as long as this, maybe it's fair to draw some conclusions. (See point 1) Notice there's been a few chunky sells today.

Updates would be most welcome from; 5 Nov 25 RNS: Letter of Intent (\"LOI\") with a leading medical diagnostic services provider (the \"Provider\") acting in partnership with the NHS. The LOI covers the verification and validation of the Company's CIZ1B biomarker test with a NHS Foundation Trust partner in state-of-the-art laboratories which may lead to the Provider being appointed as the Company's exclusive UK supplier of the CIZ1B test. \u00b7 Commercial Launch: In August 2025, following progress achieved at their pathfinder lab, BIO realigned their accreditation and market launch strategy with a new multi-site clinical laboratory, enabling a much wider co-ordinated and comprehensive campaign to roll out the CIZ1B biomarker test in North America. Omni Health Diagnostics (\"Omni\") announced in September 2025 that the roll out programme will be nationwide in at least six states with potential further expansion. This demonstrates how BIO intends to scale its operations to meet expected demand in the USA. \u00b7 Moffitt Cancer Center Collaboration: On 9 September 2024, the Group was selected by Moffitt Cancer Center (\"Moffitt\"), Florida's leading cancer hospital, to test patients with suspicious lung nodules in a clinical evaluation using the Group's proprietary CIZ1B biomarker assay. Since then, Moffitt has been recruiting patients and collecting blood samples to ship to the University of York. We expect samples to be received shortly and testing to begin in Q4 2025. This important study to test patients for the presence of the CIZ1B Biomarker is part of a major clinical evaluation for suspected lung cancer patients. Short term finances seem secure with the financial support from Frazer Lang and the 'guaranteed' royalties  of $2.4M to be paid by December this year ($530K received by Nov 2025)",

However, if we only get one update every couple of months you\u2019d expect it to retrace back. You would assume the Lang\u2019s aren\u2019t stupid and also privy to more information than we are\u2026 if the latest CLN converts, I think they\u2019re in for 18% (c\u00a31mn\u2026 you aren\u2019t doing that based on a punt). Whether the true value gets realised is down to how well it gets the required PR\u2026and we are all aware of the worries there!

This will be at 1.4p which is where we are roughly now, and that will convert into 17,857,142 new shares. If, however, he decides not to convert, there are no associated fees or interest payments due to him from CIZ. He may also decide not to have the money returned in which case, from 5th November 2025 RNS \u201cPrior to 31 March 2026 the Company does not intend to incur any debt (other than in the ordinary course of business) or make any adjustments to its share capital while the Additional Notes are outstanding.\u201d It will become a debt but there will be no further dilution. The note which was announced in May 2025 however was for \u00a3150000 and again could be converted into new ordinary shares at 1.4p any time up to 24 months from announcement. That would be 10,714,285 shares potentially with I am sure the same stipulations as the later loan notes 5th November 2025. The Company has also issued warrants to Frazer Lang over 12,500,000 Ordinary Shares in the Company at an exercise price of 2p, to be exercised within two years of the date of issue. So, in total that is around a potential 41,071,428 shares that could be issued taking the Fraser Lang to 19.48% of the issued share capital two years from the dates of announcement. I am wondering if this is why we have been hovering around here, waiting basically on any dilution from Lang and we have until the 31st of March 2026 potentially to know. New tax year a week after that and hopefully we swing into action a little wiser.",

I can see there might be other factors - possibly  government shutdown slowing them down and some states taking longer to approve - New York slower typically and assume you\u2019d want all lined up before launching. Also didn\u2019t seem like Omnihealth DX were in a position to hit the ground running do could see that needing more time (aswell as getting up to speed after the iGenome handover). May be a funding question still\u2026not convinced payments to Cizzle plc are on schedule and may be why they\u2019ve got the Lang safety net. However, for AS to suggest it\u2019s live by year end\u2026you wouldn\u2019t do that unless you thought you were nearly there! Re comms\u2026 I just don\u2019t see it improving. A quarterly Directors Talk interview where the first 5 mins are repetitive is clearly inadequate and with no effort at all to extend interest / investor base. The cause is utterly admirable but given their approach to investor engagement, AS is talking to the exact same audience each time, so no benefit in revisiting the context each time. Having said this, AS isn\u2019t naive so I wonder if they are working to an end game and therefore shareholder engagement is less critical than in other cases\u2026there again it was this bad 3 years ago\u2026 I\u2019m thinking they are more likely to be acquired once CLIA approved as should be a material change in both value and opportunity. BIO reckon they are worth $70mn while the UK licence holder is at a mere \u00a35mn, should be easy pickings. Could also see BIO seeking to go public / seek partner investment to accelerate roll out as current speed isn\u2019t adequate and the US are far less pedestrian than the UK. Given timescales since last RNS, suspect there\u2019ll be an update this/next week, whether it\u2019s the news we are seeking\u2026time will tell.",

I'm guessing that Ciz Bio will be making good progress unless they've got a team together just a mess around for a laugh - and the yanks don't do that. They like their $$$ too much.

          "content": "Courtesy of Bubbles223 on IMM. Just found it an interesting read and most of it related to IMM which I am not invested in. When a biotech is getting close to signing a partnership, it almost never says so directly \u2014 but it always leaves a trail of signals. Investors who follow deal\u2011making watch these patterns closely because they tend to repeat across companies and across years. Here\u2019s a deeper look at how companies signal a deal is close, with each signal broken down into what it really means behind the scenes. \ud83d\udd0d The Subtle (but Reliable) Signals a Deal Is Near 1. Senior leadership suddenly becomes very visible CEO and CSO attending partnering events together Multiple executives presenting instead of just one Frequent interviews or investor updates When a deal is early, business development teams handle it. When a deal is close, executives must be present because final terms require top\u2011level approval. 2. The company attends high\u2011level partnering conferences JP Morgan Healthcare Conference BIO International Convention Biotech Showcase in San Francisco These events are where final negotiations often happen. Companies don\u2019t send their full leadership team unless they expect meaningful progress. 3. Language in press releases becomes more specific Look for shifts like: \u201cWe are in discussions\u201d \u2192 \u201cadvanced discussions with multiple parties\u201d \u201cExploring options\u201d \u2192 \u201cdetailed due diligence underway\u201d \u201cEngagement ongoing\u201d \u2192 \u201cmultiple confidentiality agreements signed\u201d Public companies choose their words carefully. When the language tightens, it\u2019s intentional. 4. Silence \u2014 the good kind Fewer scientific updates No new exploratory programs announced Reduced commentary on timelines When a deal is close, companies often go quiet because: they\u2019re under NDA they don\u2019t want to disrupt negotiations they\u2019re preparing coordinated announcements with the partner Silence is often louder than words. 5. The company begins referencing \u201cvalue inflection\u201d events \u201cTransformational opportunity\u201d \u201cStrategic partnership discussions\u201d \u201cMultiple interested parties\u201d This is coded language for: We\u2019re negotiating, and we want the market to know something big is coming. \ud83e\udde0 The strongest signal of all When a company says it is: meeting multiple top\u201110 pharma companies, attending JP Morgan with its full leadership team, and has multiple confidentiality agreements signed, that confidentiality agreements signed, This is a sign that a deal is in the late stages.",

(And I've stated it in the past) Even if they do overcome the (obviously problematic) obstacle to commercialisation, what does that actually look like? If they get the PR right , it opens to a great fanfair r in the US, share price (MC) spikes to maybe 15-25 mill market cap. Then what? Sales are predicted to be very slow...so share price slumps back to maybe 10mill MC. So what happens then? I predict a massive fundraiser in the UK to get the ball rolling over here and in Europe. At the same time Alan Symms is definitely not the leader to take this forward imo. He has no charisma or energy. So there's a share price that is halved or three quartered by a fundraiser. Probably another spike as there's news of a partner in the UK. Share price falls back...then what? (Probably a year or two years to get it going in the UK... While in the USA sales go at snails pace) In the meantime there will be other products coming to market that supersede it. Probably at some point the US company is taken out. Maybe Ciz UK is taken out for peanuts. And that's how I see the long term!",

They have therefore realigned their accreditation and market launch plans to the new multi-site clinical laboratory to enable a much wider co-ordinated and comprehensive campaign to roll out the CIZ1B biomarker test in North America, to help detect early-stage lung cancer. This new agreement with a significantly larger multi-site clinical laboratory demonstrates how BIO intends to scale its operations throughout the USA. \"BIO's commitment to our strong partnership is also evident by the receipt of an early advance royalty payment which means the Company has now received US$525,000. We have since agreed to a more balanced payment schedule through to the end of 2026 which will see the remainder of the advance royalty fees being received by Cizzle Biotechnology earlier. \"I look forward to announcing further updates on BIO's commercial progress in North America and the Company's strategy to make its CIZ1B biomarker test available globally in due course.\"",

They'll either do it right I'm gain some traction with a PR and marketing campaign, or , in time honoured Ciz style, they'll get it all wrong and it could be a damp squib...

          "content": "These things clearly take time and I struggle to see how BIO can be criticised for the progress they\u2019ve made in the last 12 months - built a strong team, economic model through ASCO, Tasso dev, validation steps, multiple partners signed for studies etc\u2026 my only concern is scale of funding to roll out but assume a partner model will be forthcoming in the coming months. As for the UK Plc, there are only four of them. AS predominantly full time, DC has a research lab to run aswell, and then two part-timers so progress from the licence holder isn\u2019t going to be as quick as desired, I can\u2019t see them expanding the team to expedite progress otherwise this would have been done previously\u2026 In terms of criticism, there are a few key weaknesses imv\u2026and shared by most I assume\u2026 1. Commercial directorship - pace could be increased in terms of other regions. Validation processes will always take time but non-scientific elements you would expect could have been expedited. 2. Lack of comms - age old issue which hasn\u2019t improved. Still using Directors Talk which is very limited, no Q&A, no attempt to engage new investors, 3-4 trades a day the result of lack of visibility. Assumption is they are relying on milestones to realise value but still feels way too passive. 3. Economic with the truth - not unique to Ciz by any stretch, communicate after issue has been resolved - there are a couple of occasions where goalposts have changed but with no explanation\u2026namely mAb production from Proteogenix to BBI and then the move from iGenomeDX to OmnihealthDX, the pathfinder narrative didn\u2019t feel accurate. You\u2019d expect things to go wrong / need to change direction, but would be beneficial if there was a more honest dialogue. As an investor it\u2019s hard to argue too much with you OldMoot given SP is languishing at 1.5p and MC at \u00a35mn is way below the IPOd \u00a322mn\u2026. so far, it\u2019s fundamentally underperformed and purely from an investors perspective you\u2019d clearly have been better off invested elsewhere. (There\u2019s no doubting the company aim is a very worthwhile one and hope it flies globally to help improve prognosis of those with a positive LC diagnosis.) Anyway, given CLIA accreditation, launch, grant funding, UK LoI conversion (hopefully) etc\u2026 are \u201cnear term\u201d hoping Q1 \u201826 finally sees value being realised\u2026 it\u2019s been a painful wait but fundamentals still seem positive (to me at least)\u2026 (hopefully no RNS before Christmas\u2026) Merry Christmas all!",

If that's the bloke you're referring to, I've got more PR and journalism experience in my little finger than he appears to have He's done absolutely b*get all apart from apparently craft that very average website. No idea why is on board apart from jobs for the boys maybe. Starting to feel like a bit of a joke this. .Ciz Bio US who stated their gastric test what's coming out early 2025, and claimed in April that they had the commercial tie up for the lung cancer test (which turned out not to be the correct company after all).. And Ciz UK bulling about April launch right up to the date -when they obviously knew. Can't believe a word regarding timelines. They just throw words into the air to keep it trundling along. Comms are THE PITS. Could be this year for launch, could be next, could be never if it's not validated properly. I'm expecting more of these mini fundraisers that have been going on . It may all be going swimmingly, but it may not. Who knows where the company that cannot tell the truth on timelines.",

Since validation should not take as long as this, maybe it's fair to draw some conclusions. (See point 1) Notice there's been a few chunky sells today.

Updates would be most welcome from; 5 Nov 25 RNS: Letter of Intent (\"LOI\") with a leading medical diagnostic services provider (the \"Provider\") acting in partnership with the NHS. The LOI covers the verification and validation of the Company's CIZ1B biomarker test with a NHS Foundation Trust partner in state-of-the-art laboratories which may lead to the Provider being appointed as the Company's exclusive UK supplier of the CIZ1B test. \u00b7 Commercial Launch: In August 2025, following progress achieved at their pathfinder lab, BIO realigned their accreditation and market launch strategy with a new multi-site clinical laboratory, enabling a much wider co-ordinated and comprehensive campaign to roll out the CIZ1B biomarker test in North America. Omni Health Diagnostics (\"Omni\") announced in September 2025 that the roll out programme will be nationwide in at least six states with potential further expansion. This demonstrates how BIO intends to scale its operations to meet expected demand in the USA. \u00b7 Moffitt Cancer Center Collaboration: On 9 September 2024, the Group was selected by Moffitt Cancer Center (\"Moffitt\"), Florida's leading cancer hospital, to test patients with suspicious lung nodules in a clinical evaluation using the Group's proprietary CIZ1B biomarker assay. Since then, Moffitt has been recruiting patients and collecting blood samples to ship to the University of York. We expect samples to be received shortly and testing to begin in Q4 2025. This important study to test patients for the presence of the CIZ1B Biomarker is part of a major clinical evaluation for suspected lung cancer patients. Short term finances seem secure with the financial support from Frazer Lang and the 'guaranteed' royalties  of $2.4M to be paid by December this year ($530K received by Nov 2025)",

This will be at 1.4p which is where we are roughly now, and that will convert into 17,857,142 new shares. If, however, he decides not to convert, there are no associated fees or interest payments due to him from CIZ. He may also decide not to have the money returned in which case, from 5th November 2025 RNS \u201cPrior to 31 March 2026 the Company does not intend to incur any debt (other than in the ordinary course of business) or make any adjustments to its share capital while the Additional Notes are outstanding.\u201d It will become a debt but there will be no further dilution. The note which was announced in May 2025 however was for \u00a3150000 and again could be converted into new ordinary shares at 1.4p any time up to 24 months from announcement. That would be 10,714,285 shares potentially with I am sure the same stipulations as the later loan notes 5th November 2025. The Company has also issued warrants to Frazer Lang over 12,500,000 Ordinary Shares in the Company at an exercise price of 2p, to be exercised within two years of the date of issue. So, in total that is around a potential 41,071,428 shares that could be issued taking the Fraser Lang to 19.48% of the issued share capital two years from the dates of announcement. I am wondering if this is why we have been hovering around here, waiting basically on any dilution from Lang and we have until the 31st of March 2026 potentially to know. New tax year a week after that and hopefully we swing into action a little wiser.",

I can see there might be other factors - possibly  government shutdown slowing them down and some states taking longer to approve - New York slower typically and assume you\u2019d want all lined up before launching. Also didn\u2019t seem like Omnihealth DX were in a position to hit the ground running do could see that needing more time (aswell as getting up to speed after the iGenome handover). May be a funding question still\u2026not convinced payments to Cizzle plc are on schedule and may be why they\u2019ve got the Lang safety net. However, for AS to suggest it\u2019s live by year end\u2026you wouldn\u2019t do that unless you thought you were nearly there! Re comms\u2026 I just don\u2019t see it improving. A quarterly Directors Talk interview where the first 5 mins are repetitive is clearly inadequate and with no effort at all to extend interest / investor base. The cause is utterly admirable but given their approach to investor engagement, AS is talking to the exact same audience each time, so no benefit in revisiting the context each time. Having said this, AS isn\u2019t naive so I wonder if they are working to an end game and therefore shareholder engagement is less critical than in other cases\u2026there again it was this bad 3 years ago\u2026 I\u2019m thinking they are more likely to be acquired once CLIA approved as should be a material change in both value and opportunity. BIO reckon they are worth $70mn while the UK licence holder is at a mere \u00a35mn, should be easy pickings. Could also see BIO seeking to go public / seek partner investment to accelerate roll out as current speed isn\u2019t adequate and the US are far less pedestrian than the UK.

Multiple people also think this and my multiple friends also notice this. It's just a multiple comment. However I think the multiple points you made were very good - apart from the one about silence. Which can mean either that things aren't going well or are going well. I'm guessing that Ciz Bio will be making good progress unless they've got a team together just a mess around for a laugh - and the yanks don't do that. They like their $$$ too much. Metaphorically  speaking (certainly not in a political way) it seems they've got a Donald Trump in charge of their operations and we've got Keir Starmer.",

          "content": "Courtesy of Bubbles223 on IMM. Just found it an interesting read and most of it related to IMM which I am not invested in. When a biotech is getting close to signing a partnership, it almost never says so directly \u2014 but it always leaves a trail of signals. Investors who follow deal\u2011making watch these patterns closely because they tend to repeat across companies and across years. Here\u2019s a deeper look at how companies signal a deal is close, with each signal broken down into what it really means behind the scenes. \ud83d\udd0d The Subtle (but Reliable) Signals a Deal Is Near 1. Senior leadership suddenly becomes very visible CEO and CSO attending partnering events together Multiple executives presenting instead of just one Frequent interviews or investor updates When a deal is early, business development teams handle it. When a deal is close, executives must be present because final terms require top\u2011level approval. 2. The company attends high\u2011level partnering conferences JP Morgan Healthcare Conference BIO International Convention Biotech Showcase in San Francisco These events are where final negotiations often happen. Companies don\u2019t send their full leadership team unless they expect meaningful progress. 3. Language in press releases becomes more specific Look for shifts like: \u201cWe are in discussions\u201d \u2192 \u201cadvanced discussions with multiple parties\u201d \u201cExploring options\u201d \u2192 \u201cdetailed due diligence underway\u201d \u201cEngagement ongoing\u201d \u2192 \u201cmultiple confidentiality agreements signed\u201d Public companies choose their words carefully. When the language tightens, it\u2019s intentional. 4. Silence \u2014 the good kind Fewer scientific updates No new exploratory programs announced Reduced commentary on timelines When a deal is close, companies often go quiet because: they\u2019re under NDA they don\u2019t want to disrupt negotiations they\u2019re preparing coordinated announcements with the partner Silence is often louder than words. 5. The company begins referencing \u201cvalue inflection\u201d events \u201cTransformational opportunity\u201d \u201cStrategic partnership discussions\u201d \u201cMultiple interested parties\u201d This is coded language for: We\u2019re negotiating, and we want the market to know something big is coming. \ud83e\udde0 The strongest signal of all When a company says it is: meeting multiple top\u201110 pharma companies, attending JP Morgan with its full leadership team, and has multiple confidentiality agreements signed, that confidentiality agreements signed, This is a sign that a deal is in the late stages.",

(And I've stated it in the past) Even if they do overcome the (obviously problematic) obstacle to commercialisation, what does that actually look like? If they get the PR right , it opens to a great fanfair r in the US, share price (MC) spikes to maybe 15-25 mill market cap. Then what? Sales are predicted to be very slow...so share price slumps back to maybe 10mill MC. So what happens then? I predict a massive fundraiser in the UK to get the ball rolling over here and in Europe. At the same time Alan Symms is definitely not the leader to take this forward imo. He has no charisma or energy. So there's a share price that is halved or three quartered by a fundraiser. Probably another spike as there's news of a partner in the UK. Share price falls back...then what? (Probably a year or two years to get it going in the UK... While in the USA sales go at snails pace) In the meantime there will be other products coming to market that supersede it. Probably at some point the US company is taken out. Maybe Ciz UK is taken out for peanuts. And that's how I see the long term!",

They have therefore realigned their accreditation and market launch plans to the new multi-site clinical laboratory to enable a much wider co-ordinated and comprehensive campaign to roll out the CIZ1B biomarker test in North America, to help detect early-stage lung cancer. This new agreement with a significantly larger multi-site clinical laboratory demonstrates how BIO intends to scale its operations throughout the USA. \"BIO's commitment to our strong partnership is also evident by the receipt of an early advance royalty payment which means the Company has now received US$525,000.

As for the UK Plc, there are only four of them. AS predominantly full time, DC has a research lab to run aswell, and then two part-timers so progress from the licence holder isn\u2019t going to be as quick as desired, I can\u2019t see them expanding the team to expedite progress otherwise this would have been done previously\u2026 In terms of criticism, there are a few key weaknesses imv\u2026and shared by most I assume\u2026 1. Commercial directorship - pace could be increased in terms of other regions. Validation processes will always take time but non-scientific elements you would expect could have been expedited. 2. Lack of comms - age old issue which hasn\u2019t improved. Still using Directors Talk which is very limited, no Q&A, no attempt to engage new investors, 3-4 trades a day the result of lack of visibility. Assumption is they are relying on milestones to realise value but still feels way too passive. 3. Economic with the truth - not unique to Ciz by any stretch, communicate after issue has been resolved - there are a couple of occasions where goalposts have changed but with no explanation\u2026namely mAb production from Proteogenix to BBI and then the move from iGenomeDX to OmnihealthDX, the pathfinder narrative didn\u2019t feel accurate. You\u2019d expect things to go wrong / need to change direction, but would be beneficial if there was a more honest dialogue. As an investor it\u2019s hard to argue too much with you OldMoot given SP is languishing at 1.5p and MC at \u00a35mn is way below the IPOd \u00a322mn\u2026. so far, it\u2019s fundamentally underperformed and purely from an investors perspective you\u2019d clearly have been better off invested elsewhere. (There\u2019s no doubting the company aim is a very worthwhile one and hope it flies globally to help improve prognosis of those with a positive LC diagnosis.) Anyway, given CLIA accreditation, launch, grant funding, UK LoI conversion (hopefully) etc\u2026 are \u201cnear term\u201d hoping Q1 \u201826 finally sees value being realised\u2026 it\u2019s been a painful wait but fundamentals still seem positive (to me at least)\u2026 (hopefully no RNS before Christmas\u2026) Merry Christmas all!",

And Ciz UK bulling about April launch right up to the date -when they obviously knew. Can't believe a word regarding timelines. They just throw words into the air to keep it trundling along. Comms are THE PITS. Could be this year for launch, could be next, could be never if it's not validated properly. I'm expecting more of these mini fundraisers that have been going on . It may all be going swimmingly, but it may not. Who knows where the company that cannot tell the truth on timelines.",

Since validation should not take as long as this, maybe it's fair to draw some conclusions. (See point 1) Notice there's been a few chunky sells today. Hard to gauge what is going on behind the scenes with such a dreadful company regarding shareholder respect",

Updates would be most welcome from; 5 Nov 25 RNS: Letter of Intent (\"LOI\") with a leading medical diagnostic services provider (the \"Provider\") acting in partnership with the NHS. The LOI covers the verification and validation of the Company's CIZ1B biomarker test with a NHS Foundation Trust partner in state-of-the-art laboratories which may lead to the Provider being appointed as the Company's exclusive UK supplier of the CIZ1B test. \u00b7 Commercial Launch: In August 2025, following progress achieved at their pathfinder lab, BIO realigned their accreditation and market launch strategy with a new multi-site clinical laboratory, enabling a much wider co-ordinated and comprehensive campaign to roll out the CIZ1B biomarker test in North America. Omni Health Diagnostics (\"Omni\") announced in September 2025 that the roll out programme will be nationwide in at least six states with potential further expansion. This demonstrates how BIO intends to scale its operations to meet expected demand in the USA. \u00b7 Moffitt Cancer Center Collaboration: On 9 September 2024, the Group was selected by Moffitt Cancer Center (\"Moffitt\"), Florida's leading cancer hospital, to test patients with suspicious lung nodules in a clinical evaluation using the Group's proprietary CIZ1B biomarker assay. Since then, Moffitt has been recruiting patients and collecting blood samples to ship to the University of York. We expect samples to be received shortly and testing to begin in Q4 2025. This important study to test patients for the presence of the CIZ1B Biomarker is part of a major clinical evaluation for suspected lung cancer patients. Short term finances seem secure with the financial support from Frazer Lang and the 'guaranteed' royalties  of $2.4M to be paid by December this year ($530K received by Nov 2025)",
