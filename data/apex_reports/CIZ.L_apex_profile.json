Today, the Company announced that it has entered into a Letter of Intent (\"LOI\") with a leading medical diagnostic services provider (the \"Provider\") acting in partnership with the NHS as result of that initiative.\nThe Additional Notes will be issued as an extension to the Company's existing unsecured convertible loan notes of \u00a3150,000 (\"Original Notes\") issued to Frazer Lang (the \"Note Holder\"), on 18 May 2025.\nThe\nCompany may issue the Additional Notes at \u00a350,000 per month and any funds received will be used in connection with the Company's focus on commercialising its CIZ1B biomarker test in North America and the UK. Any\nAdditional Notes issued are convertible at any time up to 31 March 2026, at the election of the Note Holder, into new ordinary shares of 0.01p in the Company (\"Ordinary Shares\") at a price of 1.4 pence per ordinary share. No interest or fees are payable on the Additional Notes.\nPrior to 31 March 2026 the Company does not intend to incur any debt (other than in the ordinary course of business) or make any adjustments to its share capital while the Additional Notes are outstanding. Frazer Lang has committed to only redeem the Original Notes and Additional Notes for ordinary shares and not seek any cash repayment.\nThe Company has also issued warrants to Frazer Lang over 12,500,000 Ordinary Shares in the Company at an exercise price of 2p, to be exercised within two years of the date of issue.\nCommenting, Allan Syms, Executive Chairman of Cizzle Biotechnology, said:\n\"The Company is making excellent progress in finding key partners to roll out our proprietary CIZ1B biomarker test that can help in early lung cancer detection. With an established route to market in North America and the Caribbean, we are committed to ensure that patients in the UK and elsewhere in Europe will also have access to a simple, non-invasive means to find cancer early when curative intervention is possible.\nSecuring ongoing support from all our shareholders is critical in this journey and we want to thank in particular the significant investment and support we have received from Frazer Lang and his family. The further funding being received from Mr Lang provides important capital to accelerate our plans for growth and to make the test available to as many patients as soon as possible. In addition to the new programme in the UK,\nthe Company will also continue to\nsupport its US partner Cizzle BIO Inc, to secure CLIA accreditation to take the test live in the near term, and to complete the ongoing Moffitt study to t\nest patients with suspicious lung nodules in a clinical evaluation, as announced on 9 September 2024.\"\nCommenting, Frazer Lang said:\n\"I am delighted to extend my support for Cizzle through this additional funding, building on my existing shareholding. The Company's progress in partnering with world-class organisations underscores the transformative potential of the CIZ1B test in early lung cancer detection. I remain fully committed to Cizzle's mission and look forward to seeing the test benefit patients across the UK, Europe, and beyond.\"\nEnquiries:\nCizzle Biotechnology Holdings plc\nVia IFC Advisory\nAllan Syms (Executive Chairman)\nAllenby Capital Limited\n+44(0) 20 3328 5656\nJohn Depasquale / Piers Shimwell (Corporate Finance)\nAmrit Nahal (Sales and Corporate Broking)\nIFC Advisory Limited\n+44(0) 20 3934 6630\nTim Metcalfe\nFlorence Chandler\nAbout Cizzle Biotechnology\nThe CIZ1B biomarker test for early-stage lung cancer is based on the pioneering work of Professor Coverley,\nthe Founder and CSO of the Company, and her research team at the University of York\n.

The LOI covers the\nverification and validation of the Company's CIZ1B biomarker test with a NHS Foundation Trust partner\nin state-of-the-art laboratories\nwhich may lead to the Provider being appointed as the Company's exclusive UK supplier of the CIZ1B test.\nThe discovery and development of the CIZ1B biomarker test is the result of many years of pioneering work by Professor Dawn Coverley, the Company's founder and CSO, and her research team at the University of York. Initially supported by Yorkshire Cancer Research it has always been the ambition to ensure patients and healthcare professionals in the NHS and elsewhere should benefit from the Company's work in early cancer detection as part of its commercial roll out plans.\nAs part of the Company's commercial strategy to licence its proprietary test for the CIZ1B biomarker for use in the early detection of lung cancer globally, it has already secured a licence agreement in North America and the Caribbean, with guaranteed royalties and up-front fees of US$2.4 million, of which US$530,000 has already been received.\nOn 20 May 2025, the Company secured funding of \u00a3150,000 through the issue of convertible loan notes from the Company's existing shareholder, Frazer Lang\nto provide additional funding\nto support the Company's growth strategy, in particular to roll out its CIZ1B early cancer test\nin the UK and elsewhere in Europe. The intended partnership with the Provider, which for commercial reasons is confidential at this time, is a result of that programme.\nHaving established a route to market in North America and the Caribbean, the Company was keen to ensure that patients in the UK and then elsewhere in Europe, will also benefit from how the CIZ1B biomarker test can help in early lung cancer detection. This aligns with the current NHS cancer plan to improve cancer survival by increasing the proportion of cancers diagnosed at stages 1 and 2 with an aim to save 55,000 lives per year by 2028. A key element of this is improving access to early diagnosis, and increasing the number of cancers identified through screening.\nUnder the terms of the LOI,\nthe Provider will immediately carry out a validation exercise with the Company and provide clinical input for the intended clinical indication of CIZ1B. Cizzle will provide on-site technical support under the guidance of Professor Coverley to confirm assay performance data. Following agreed success criteria, the parties will negotiate a Partnership Agreement for the commercialisation of the CIZ1B test. The Provider may then be appointed as the exclusive UK supplier of the CIZ1B test (subject to regulatory frameworks, including CE/UKCA/HIE requirements) and together, Cizzle and the Provider will jointly develop a go-to-market strategy, including co-branding and aligned communications. A commercial distribution model based on revenue share or a licensing structure, with a rollout strategy beyond the UK into Europe across private and NHS markets, will be negotiated.\nThe Company will also continue to focus on\nsupporting its US partner Cizzle BIO Inc, to secure CLIA accreditation to take the test live in the near term, and on completing the ongoing Moffitt study to t\nest patients with suspicious lung nodules in a clinical evaluation, as announced on 9 September 2024.\nCommenting, Allan Syms, Executive Chairman of Cizzle Biotechnology, said:\n\"We announced in May 2025 that while continuing to support the Company's licensing partner in North America, we would now be seeking an additional licensing partnership in the UK and rest of Europe. We are excited to report we have now entered a LOI with a leading UK provider\nwith partnerships with NHS Foundation Trusts. Our goal is to provide a first-class service to help drive early cancer detection at scale globally.\nWe are now pleased that t\nhe UK will be the next phase\nof our growth plans in making the test available to many patients as soon as possible.\nEnquiries:\nCizzle Biotechnology Holdings plc\nVia IFC Advisory\nAllan Syms (Executive Chairman)\nAllenby Capital Limited\n+44(0) 20 3328 5656\nJohn Depasquale / Piers Shimwell (Corporate Finance)\nAmrit Nahal (Sales and Corporate Broking)\nIFC Advisory Limited\n+44(0) 20 3934 6630\nTim Metcalfe\nFlorence Chandler\nAbout Cizzle Biotechnology\nThe CIZ1B biomarker test for early-stage lung cancer is based on the pioneering work of Professor Coverley,\nthe Founder and CSO of the Company, and her research team at the University of York\n.

Omni Health Diagnostics (\"Omni\") announced in September 2025 that the roll out programme will be nationwide in at least six states with potential further expansion. This demonstrates how BIO intends to scale its operations to meet expected demand in the USA.\n\u00b7\nMoffitt Cancer Center Collaboration\n: On 9 September 2024, the Group was selected by Moffitt Cancer Center (\"Moffitt\"), Florida's leading cancer hospital, to test patients with suspicious lung nodules in a clinical evaluation using the Group's proprietary CIZ1B biomarker assay. Since then, Moffitt has been recruiting patients and collecting blood samples to ship to the University of York. We expect samples to be received shortly and testing to begin in Q4 2025. This important study to test patients for the presence of the CIZ1B Biomarker is part of a major clinical evaluation for suspected lung cancer patients.\nCommenting Allan Syms, Chairman of Cizzle Biotechnology, said\n:\n\"The first half of 2025 has been a period focussed on validation, accreditation and building, together with our licensing partner Cizzle BIO in the USA, a comprehensive base from which our simple blood test to help in the early detection of lung cancer can be launched for commercial use. Enabled by\nthe Company's agreement with\nBBI Solutions (\"BBI\"),\nan\nestablished accredited supplier who now manufacture our antibodies in their\nISO 13485-certified facilities\n, BIO has completed its pathfinder programme and entered into an agreement with Omni Health Diagnostics to launch the test across the USA through multiple sites to meet expected demand. BIO have invested in significant marketing and partnership campaigns to build awareness through a co-ordinated campaign and are now poised for commercial launch. The accreditation process is underway at Omni, who expect to obtain CLIA accreditation and launch in the near future. The Company continues to receive payments from BIO as part of the advanced royalty schedule, which demonstrates the close working relationship we have as we create a platform to help detect lung cancer early. The Company is now expanding its licensing activities elsewhere, including in the UK, and we look forward to updating our shareholders with progress in due course.\"\nExecutive Chairman's Statement\nOperational and strategic overview\nIn Cancer Research UK's report on 'Early Detection and Diagnosis of Cancer: A Roadmap to the Future' *Professor Chris Whitty, Chief Medical Officer for England and Chief Scientific Adviser for the Department of Health and Social Care said \"\nThe early detection and diagnosis of serious disease, including cancer, changes outcomes substantially. If cancer can be intercepted at the earliest clinically relevant timepoint this gives a much better chance of survival and an improved quality of life.\"\nWith over 5,000 people daily losing their lives to lung cancer and the main reason being the lack of early detection, the Group's technology aims to eliminate barriers, empowering patients and healthcare providers with a cutting-edge solution to one of the greatest challenges in modern medicine. The Group's vision is a global shift in lung cancer survival through accurate, low cost, non-invasive early detection at scale. The Group remains focussed on the systematic development and commercialisation of novel and proprietary clinical diagnostic tests for the early detection of cancer particularly where there is an unmet clinical need.\nThe Group's platform technology is based on the ability to detect a stable plasma biomarker, a variant of a normal protein, CIZ1, which is a naturally occurring cell nuclear protein involved in DNA replication. The targeted CIZ1B variant is highly correlated with early-stage lung cancer and since the Group's admission to the London Stock Exchange in 2021, it has invested in the development of its technology to enable its full commercialisation through a global licensing and partnership strategy.\nWith the commercial manufacture of CIZ1B monoclonal antibodies now established, and a guaranteed royalty stream being generated by our first licensing partner BIO in North America and the Caribbean, and validation of the test in progress, it is anticipated that commercial sales will begin in the near future followed by further licensing and partnership deals elsewhere in the world.\n*https://assets.ctfassets.net/u7vsjnoopqo5/2Q32Uv00MxEAUS34Gw8WHk/68ee767b745332d8ce1daf81037807dc/early_detection_diagnosis_of_cancer_roadmap.pdf\nResearch and Development Progress\nBased on the original published research by Professor Coverley and her team at the University of York, it has been shown that CIZ1B can be measured with high sensitivity that should allow for non-intrusive, cost-effective testing in a high-throughput, hospital-friendly format, and in the future a potential rapid point of care test for use in doctors' offices and pharmacies. During the period, Cizzle continued to support its research agreement and collaboration with the University of York which has been extended to 28 June 2026. The Group has reported the successful generation and subsequent manufacture of its proprietary monoclonal antibodies by BBI, the world's largest independent producer of immunodiagnostic reagents. Entry into production of this central component of the Company's test to detect the presence of the CIZ1B biomarker, was an inflexion point in enabling the clinical validation process to be undertaken.\nProfessor Coverley's team have been instrumental in their support to BIO's pathfinder laboratory and to Omni Health Diagnostics in providing a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) which serves as an operational guide for the clinical laboratories that will seek CLIA accreditation of the CIZ1B test as a LDT in North America. This ensures uniformity in performance, quality control, and adherence to regulations, which reduces errors, improves safety, and preserves institutional knowledge within an organisation and is essential in obtaining regulatory validation in the near term.\nThe Group announced on 9 September 2024 that it had been selected by the Moffitt Cancer Center, the number one cancer hospital in Florida and the Southeast USA, to test patients with suspicious lung nodules in a clinical evaluation using the Group's proprietary CIZ1B biomarker assay. Since then, Moffitt has been recruiting a large patient cohort and will send the first batch of blood samples to be tested for the CIZ1B Biomarker at the University of York. As previously reported, this will for the first time be analysing patient blood samples to determine biomarker accuracy in predicting whether or not a lung nodule is likely to be cancer as part of a real-world clinical evaluation in a hospital setting.\nLicensing Strategy and Commercial Progress\nThe Company continues to operate a global licensing and partnership strategy because the directors believe this is the fastest and most cost-effective means to bring its technology to market. For product solutions, an outsourcing approach has been adopted which aims to leverage external partners expertise and to provide an effective cost management process. As such the Group has benefited from its research and development agreement with the University of York through access to skilled scientists and laboratory facilities. It has also produced commercial antibodies through agreement with an industry leading and iso 13485 accredited facility, and has secured its first royalty bearing licensing agreement in North America and the Caribbean. The licensing approach of up-front fees and guaranteed royalties has generated important revenue for the Group, avoided the need to fund and build an expert team in the licensed territory and as such accelerated market deployment and installation of laboratory testing accreditation and testing capability.\nBIO is now completing validation of the test with its new clinical diagnostics laboratory group, Omni Health Diagnostics (\"Omni\"), as part of a national expansion strategy based on Omni's active laboratory acquisitions and partnerships programme to provide testing capability in Texas, New York, California, South Carolina, Tennessee and Florida which will provide nationwide testing coverage. It is expected that BIO will add further clinical laboratory partners as required to be able to meet anticipated market demand across North America when the test completes Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (\"CLIA\") accreditation as a Laboratory Developed Test (\"LDT\").\nThe anticipated commercial launch of the Group's CIZ1B test in the USA is expected to be followed by the Group's expansion into different geographies, and maximise speed and scale of market entry through specialist licensing partners globally. The Group's next focus will be in the UK and Europe.\nFunding\nDuring the period, the Group\nannounced that it has raised \u00a3150,000 through the issue of a convertible loan note (the \"Note\"), to provide additional funding\nto support the Company's growth strategy, in particular to seek partnerships for its CIZ1B early cancer test\nin the UK and elsewhere in Europe, following the successful licensing agreement with BIO in North America.\nThe Note, which was subscribed for by Frazer Lang, an existing investor in the Company, is convertible at any time, at the election of the Note holder, during its 24-month term into new ordinary shares in the Company at a price of 1.4 pence per share. No interest is payable on the Note.\nOn 18 August 2025, the Company announced\nBIO's appointment of a new multi-site full scale COLA and CLIA accredited laboratory group (later announced as Omni) to launch the Company's CIZ1B biomarker test throughout the USA. As part of agreed advance exclusivity and royalty fees, BIO paid an early payment of US$125,000 to the Company bringing total receipts at that date of US$525,000 of the guaranteed advance payments of US$2.4m. The Company and BIO have now agreed to a new regular payment schedule that will result in all remaining advance royalties being received by the end of 2026.\nFinancial overview\nDuring the six months ended 30 June 2025, the Company continued its focus on being a healthcare diagnostics developer. The Group consists of Cizzle Biotechnology Holdings PLC as the parent company with wholly owned subsidiaries, Cizzle Biotechnology Ltd (\"CBL\") and Cizzle Biotech Ltd (formerly Enfis Ltd). The current Group structure was formed when the Company completed the acquisition of CBL on 14 May 2021 and was admitted to trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange.\nThe financial results for the six months to 30 June 2025 are summarised as follows:\n\u00b7\nOther income and interest receivable: \u00a31,000 (H1 2024: \u00a379,000)\n\u00b7\nCorporate expenses, before exceptional items: \u00a3346,000 (H1 2024: \u00a3299,000).\n\u00b7\nNon-cash administrative expenses relating to:\no\nshare option charge: \u00a310,000 (H1 2024: \u00a3120,000)\no\nNet fair value loss on financial asset: \u00a3Nil (H1 2024: \u00a31,081,000) (related to a current asset investment in Conduit Pharmaceuticals Inc (\"Conduit\"), a NASDAQ listed company, that was sold in H1 2025 for a loss on sale of investment \u00a326,000 (H1 2024: \u00a3Nil).\n\u00b7\nTaxation credit: \u00a313,000 (H1 2024: \u00a310,000)\n\u00b7\nTotal comprehensive loss of \u00a3368,000 (H1 2024, Loss \u00a31,411,000).\n\u00b7\nLoss per share 0.09p, (H1 2024, Loss of 0.37p).\n\u00b7\nCash balances as at 30 June 2025: \u00a3182,000 (30 June 2024: \u00a3484,000).\nResponsibility Statement\nWe confirm that to the best of our knowledge:\n\u00b7\nthe interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standards 34, Interim Financial Reporting;\n\u00b7\ngive a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and loss of the Company;\n\u00b7\nthe Interim report includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.7R of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules, being an indication of important events that have occurred during the first six months of the financial year and their impact on the set of interim financial statements; and a description of the principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining six months of the year; and\n\u00b7\nthe Interim report includes a fair review of the information required by DTR 4.2.8R of the Disclosure and Transparency Rules, being the information required on related party transactions.\nThe interim report was approved by the Board of Directors and the above responsibility statement was signed on its behalf by Allan Syms on 30 September 2025.\nEnquiries:\nCizzle Biotechnology Holdings plc\nVia IFC Advisory\nAllan Syms (Executive Chairman)\nAllenby Capital Limited\n+44(0) 20 3328 5656\nJohn Depasquale\nPiers Shimwell\nIFC Advisory Limited\n+44(0) 20 3934 6630\nTim Metcalfe\nFlorence Chandler\nAbout Cizzle Biotechnology\nBased on the pioneering work of Professor Coverley and colleagues, on a naturally occurring variant of the cell nuclear protein CIZ1, the CIZ1B biomarker is highly associated with the presence of early-stage cancer.

The financial information for the year ended 31 December 2024 has been extracted from the audited financial statements for this period. The financial information has been prepared in accordance with accounting policies consistent with those set out in the Group financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2024.\n2. Continuing and discontinued operations\nThe Group is considered to have one class of business which is focused on the early detection of lung cancer via the development of an immunoassay test for the CIZ1B biomarker.\n3. Income Tax\nThe Income tax credit of \u00a313,000 for the six months ended 30 June 2025 relates to accrued income for the recovery of tax on qualifying research and development expenditure. For the six months ended 30 June 2024 there was an income tax credit of \u00a310,000 and a credit of \u00a321,000 for the year ended 31 December 2024.\n4.

BIO is now completing validation of the test with its new clinical diagnostics laboratory group,\nOmni Health Diagnostics (\"Omni\"), as part of a national expansion strategy based on Omni's\nactive laboratory acquisitions and partnerships programme to provide testing capability in Texas, New York, California, South Carolina, Tennessee and Florida which will provide nationwide testing coverage. It is expected that BIO will add further clinical laboratory partners as required to be able to meet anticipated market demand across North America when the test completes\nClinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (\"CLIA\") accreditation as a Laboratory Developed Test (\"LDT\").\nBIO continues to make regular payments as part of the revised advance royalty payment schedule of US$2.4m to be paid in full by the end of 2026, as announced on 18 August 2025.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nBIO, as part of a US wide roll out strategy, has partnered with Omni to complete its validation programme for the Company's CIZ1B biomarker test to help in the early detection of lung cancer. Omni intends to enable a multiple site testing capability from COLA or CAP and CLIA accredited laboratories to meet anticipated demand following the planned launch of the test in the near term.\n\u00b7\nThe Company has received further advance payments from BIO as part of the revised royalty payment schedule.\nBIO's strategy to\nlaunch the Company's CIZ1B biomarker test at multiple sites throughout the USA\nThe Company has been working closely with its exclusive licensing partner BIO to market\nits proprietary CIZ1B biomarker test to help detect early-stage lung cancer, throughout the USA, Canada and the Caribbean as a LDT in CLIA accredited laboratories.\nAs announced on 18 August 2025, BIO has initiated a US national strategy for\naccreditation and market launch across multiple sites as part of a wider co-ordinated and comprehensive campaign to roll out the CIZ1B biomarker test in North America to help detect early-stage lung cancer. The Company can now announce that BIO has teamed with Omni\na CLIA-certified diagnostic laboratory headquartered in Richardson, Texas. It specialises in a comprehensive range of testing services, including pharmacogenomics, molecular diagnostics, clinical testing, genetic testing, and diagnostics for medical fields such as cardiology, oncology, neurology, and infectious diseases. Omni focuses on delivering precise, accurate, and reliable results to support healthcare providers and patients and has an active expansion programme to acquire or partner with other accredited laboratories throughout the USA including New York, California, South Carolina, Tennessee and Florida to enable a nationwide testing capability. While initially to be offered as a private pay for test, they intend to secure CPT (Current Procedural Terminology) codes to allow payment by Medicare and Medicaid. BIO and Omni will engage in a progressive marketing campaign, working closely with patient advocacy groups to enable easy patient engagement and so\nr\neduce premature cancer deaths and improve survival rates and quality of life for cancer patients.\nAdvance Royalty Agreement with BIO\nOn 18 August 2025, the Company announced that it had received initial payments totalling US$525,000 from its exclusive licensing agreement with BIO as part of a guaranteed payment schedule due to the Company totalling US$2.4 million to be paid in full before the end of 2026. These payments are advance payments from royalties of 10% on sales revenue in North America and the Caribbean.\nBIO has since made further payments as part of a revised regular payment that continues to support the Company's cash flow requirements.\nCommenting, Allan Syms, Executive Chairman of Cizzle Biotechnology, said:\n\"I am delighted to announce further details on the progress being made by our partner BIO, especially as they implement their strategy to reach as many people as possible who are at risk of lung cancer across multi-site accredited clinical laboratories. The team at Omni have been working hard, and with support from both BIO and the Company are striving to validate and get our CIZ1B test launched in the near future. With over 14.5 million people identified as being at high risk of getting lung cancer in the USA, it is important to develop a nationwide testing capability and I am sure we will see this develop further as demand increases.\n\"The important advance royalty payments received from BIO continue and demonstrates the full commitment of BIO to this partnership, providing a significant revenue line to the Company to meet its cash flow requirements.\n\"I had the pleasure of joining Bill Behnke, Chairman and CEO of BIO, and his team as their guest at\nthe Prevent Cancer Foundation\u00ae 40th Anniversary and Gala on September 18th, which they sponsored at the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C. With over 1,000 guests it marked four decades of the Foundation's leadership in making prevention central to the fight against cancer. The 2025 event spotlighted nationwide progress in prevention and early detection while advancing the Foundation's goal of securing congressional representation from all 50 states to honour the institutions, communities, and advocates driving change. With other guests from the Saville Cancer Screening and Prevention Center at Inova Schar Cancer Institute, a leading cancer center offering comprehensive, patient-centered care across the full spectrum of prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship and the LUNGevity Foundation, the largest national lung cancer nonprofit, which accelerates research and provides vital support for patients, the evening provided a powerful platform to raise our profile and the importance of our CIZ1B biomarker as a breakthrough tool in early lung cancer detection.
