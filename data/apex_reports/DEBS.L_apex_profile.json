          "source": "RNS",
          "content": "27 Nov 2025 07:01\nRNS Number : 1895J\nBoohoo Group Plc\n27 November 2025\nboohoo group plc\n(\"Debenhams Group\", \"Debenhams\" or the \"Company\")\nGroup Turnaround Scheme\nThe Remuneration Committee of Debenhams Group (DEBS.L) (the \"\nCommittee\n\") announces a new growth share arrangement, the Group Turnaround Scheme (the \"\nGTS\n\").\nBackground and Rationale\nFollowing the appointment of the new management team, the Committee has undertaken a comprehensive review of the Debenhams Group's remuneration policy to ensure it is fair, appropriate and closely aligned with Debenhams' multi-year turnaround strategy. The Debenhams Group's existing long term incentive schemes based on the performance of the whole Debenhams Group do not include Dan Finley (CEO) and Phil Ellis (CFO) (the\n\"Executives\"\n). Accordingly, the Committee has determined that these legacy schemes no longer incentivise the individuals that are fundamental to the Debenhams Group's future success and is proposing to replace participation in these schemes with the GTS.\nThe GTS has been designed to be a strong incentive for the Executives and certain other members of the senior management team (the \"\nParticipants\n\") to execute the turnaround strategy over the coming years and consequently restore profitability and unlock value for all shareholders.\nSignificant progress has already been made by the new leadership team to stabilise the business and position it to take advantage of opportunities. \u00a341.6m Adjusted EBITDA was reported for FY25, which reflected not only the stand-out performance of Debenhams but also the decisive actions taken by the new leadership team. The new leadership team have been instrumental in deleveraging the business following the completion of an oversubscribed equity raise of \u00a339m in December 2024, the sale of non-core property assets enabling early payment of the Debenhams Group's previous term loan and the successful completion of a new 3-year finance facility of up to \u00a3175m, more than 12 months ahead of maturity. Whilst progress has been made, the new leadership team have embarked upon a focused, multi-year turnaround strategy to restore profitability and unlock value and, as such, the GTS is intended to retain and incentivise the management team to deliver.\nThe Company has conducted a shareholder consultation process with respect to the GTS with a number of the Company's shareholders, representing 36% of the voting rights. This exercise has provided valuable feedback which has been taken on board in finalising the terms of the GTS, which have been approved by the Committee.\nCorporate Governance Considerations\nDebenhams notes that its Board has previously stated publicly that, having taken advice from Zeus Capital Limited, its Nominated Adviser, seeking shareholder support for management incentive schemes of this nature is consistent with its corporate governance aims. Debenhams has adhered to this principle in the adoption of each of its legacy executive schemes since June 2020 (\"\nPrevious Schemes\n\") by requiring the adoption of those schemes to be subject to shareholder approval at a general meeting.\nHowever, after careful consideration, the Board has concluded that making the adoption of the GTS conditional on shareholder approval at a general meeting would not be most likely to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its shareholders as a whole.\nThe principal reasons for this are as follows:\n\u00b7\nthere is no requirement under relevant company law or the AIM Rules to obtain shareholder approval before implementing the GTS;\n\u00b7\nthe Committee has carefully considered the structure of the GTS and, through the stretching growth targets and duration of the plan, sought to ensure it retains and incentivises management to drive sustained share price growth;\n\u00b7\nthe swift adoption of the GTS ensures that the senior managers (and most importantly the Executives) will be incentivised to deliver very significant share price growth as the Debenhams Group executes its strategy under the leadership of the Executives. As outlined above, significant progress has already been made by the new leadership team which has had a positive impact on the Debenhams Group's overall performance. As a result, the Committee believes implementing the GTS without delay is fundamental to maintaining this upward trajectory and enabling the Participants to solely focus on executing the turnaround strategy and creating value for all shareholders;\n\u00b7\nthe Company has undertaken shareholder consultation with a number of its key shareholders and taken on board feedback received; and\n\u00b7\na major competitor who is a significant shareholder of Debenhams continues to seek to disrupt the Debenhams Group's growth strategy and operations rather than maximise its future success; at the Debenhams general meeting on the 28 March 2025, it voted against a simple resolution to change the Company's corporate name and at the annual general meeting on 19 September 2025 it voted against customary resolutions regarding dis-application of pre-emption rights, which are regularly recommended by boards as being in the best interest of all shareholders. Accordingly, the Committee has concluded that, despite Debenhams continuing to believe in maintaining good standards of corporate governance throughout the business, seeking to consult with the wider shareholder base or seeking shareholder approval for the GTS at a general meeting would not be in the best interest of the Company's shareholders as a whole.\nThis information is disclosed in accordance with AIM Rules 10 and 11.\nStructure of the Growth Plan\nThe GTS is structured in such a way that it delivers an aggregated 6 per cent. of the growth in the market capitalisation of Debenhams to the extent that such increase is attributable to the share price increasing between \u00a30.35 per share (the \"\nFloor Price\n\") (c. 3.0x the current price per share) and \u00a33.00 per share (the \"\nCap Price\n\") (c.25.9x the current share price) during the 5-year period that the GTS is in operation.\nThe GTS is subject to three measurement dates, one 3 years after commencement of the plan which is todays date, one 4 years after commencement of the plan and one 5 years after commencement of the plan (together, the \"\nMeasurement Dates\n\"). On all Measurement Dates, the vesting price will be determined by reference to the trailing 30-day average closing share price and, provided the vesting price exceeds the Floor Price, Participants will be entitled to receive the growth in the market capitalisation of Debenhams between the Floor Price and the Cap Price. The amount of the GTS that shall be capable of vesting on each Measurement Date shall be limited to one-third of the aggregate of the total awards made under the GTS and all awards that vest on the first and second Measurement Dates shall each be subject to hold periods of 12 months.\nOn the basis of full utilisation and full vesting, the GTS will result in a maximum dilution of c.5% for existing Shareholders. To achieve full vesting, the Company's market capitalisation will be required to reach c.\u00a34.2 billion, representing a share price of \u00a33.00 per share; based on the Company's last closing share price of 10.5 pence, this would represent a (i) c.25.9x increase in share price and (ii) a minimum 92% CAGR. The number of awards issued during the measurement period and the associated Debenhams share price hurdles are set such that the maximum value of awards of the GTS will be c.\u00a3222 million if the Share Price is at or above \u00a33.00 at each of the three Measurement Dates.\nAssuming the whole GTS is awarded in full, the key terms of the GTS are summarised below.\nIllustrative share price (\u00a3)\n\u00a30.35\n\u00a30.60\n\u00a30.80\n\u00a31.00\n\u00a31.20\n\u00a31.50\n\u00a33.00\nMultiple of current share price\n3.0x\n5.2x\n6.9x\n8.6x\n10.3x\n12.9x\n25.9x\nImplied Market Cap (\u00a3m)\n489\n838\n1,118\n1,397\n1,677\n2,096\n4,192\nAward size at the illustrative share price as at the date of the performance condition being achieved (\u00a3m)\n-\n21.0\n37.7\n54.5\n71.3\n96.4\n222.2\nImplied shareholder value created over term of the plan (\u00a3m)\n327\n676\n956\n1,235\n1,515\n1,934\n4,030\nDilution per tranche\n-\n2.4%\n0.8%\n0.5%\n0.3%\n0.3%\n0.6%\nCumulative dilution\n-\n2.4%\n3.3%\n3.8%\n4.1%\n4.4%\n5.0%\nThe above vesting periods will end sooner than the stated Measurement Dates upon a change of control of the Company by virtue of a takeover or statutory scheme of arrangement or a Substantial Shareholder Event having occurred. A \"\nSubstantial Shareholder Event\n\" will occur where a shareholder who holds more than 25% of the shares in the Company (from time to time) has appointed a nominee to the Board of the Company (other than following a change of control). The price per share at which any relevant change of control or Substantial Shareholder Event occurs will be deemed the relevant price for the purpose of determining vesting.\nAwards will be settled in shares, which will be newly issued by the Company.\nThe GTS has customary leaver provisions and clawback provisions for all participants.\nAn individual who participates in the GTS will not also participate in the Debenhams Incentive Plan and the 2023 Growth Share Plan.\nMahmud Kamani will not participate in the GTS, the Debenhams Incentive Plan or the 2023 Growth Share Plan.\nRelated Party Transactions\nThe Executives will participate in the GTS and will be allocated growth shares equivalent to a participation in the GTS in approximately the following proportions:\nDirector\nPercentage of the GTS\nMaximum potential award under the GTS (on basis the share price is at, or above \u00a33.00 at each of the three Measurement Dates)\nDan Finley, Chief Executive Officer\n66.67%\n\u00a3148.1m\nPhil Ellis, Chief Financial Officer\n6.67%\n\u00a314.8m\nDan Finley and Phil Ellis are related parties as defined by the AIM Rules for Companies (\"\nthe AIM Rules\n\") given they are Directors of the Company and the grant of shares to each of them under the GTS (the \"\nRelated Party Awards\n\") will therefore be a related-party transaction for the purposes of Rule 13 of the AIM Rules.\nThe independent directors being Iain McDonald, John Goold and Tom Handley (who each also sit on the Committee), Tim Morris, Kirsty Britz, Mahmud Kamani and Carol Kane consider, having consulted with Zeus Capital, Debenhams Group's Nominated Adviser, that the terms of the Related Party Awards are fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned.\nIn their considerations regarding the Related Party Awards, the Independent Directors:\n\u2022 have taken into account the maximum dilution of c.5.0% under the GTS and the stretching targets ranging up to an implied market capitalisation of over \u00a34.0 billion;\n\u2022 have taken into account that the terms of the GTS have been the subject of a shareholder consultation process; and\n\u2022 believe it is appropriate to implement this scheme without delay and without shareholder approval being sought to ensure the Executives are incentivised to deliver shareholder value immediately.\nEnquiries\nDebenhams Group\nPhil Ellis, Chief Financial Officer\nTel: +44 (0)161 233 2050\nZeus Capital - Nominated Advisor and Joint Broker\nDan Bate / James Edis\nTel: +44 (0)161 831 1512\nBenjamin Robertson\nTel: +44 (0)20 3829 5000\nPanmure Liberum - Joint Broker\nMark Dickenson/ James Sinclair-Ford/ Shalin Bhamra\nSodali & Co - Financial PR Adviser\nTel: +44 (0)20 3100 2000\nBen Foster / Louisa Henry\nTel: +44 (0)20 3984 0114\nAbout Debenhams Group\nDebenhams Group is an online platform, for fashion, home, and beauty, serving millions of customers across five shopping destinations: Debenhams, Karen Millen, boohoo, MAN and PLT.

It is stock lite, capital lite, margin rich and highly cash generative. This will improve further as we\u00a0continue to grow our take rate and realise the potential of our recent AI investments across the business.\nThere are now c.20k partners in our ecosystem (up from c.10k a year ago) and we see significant further partner growth potential. All our Group brands are now marketplace enabled, leveraging our proprietary technology ecosystem.\nAs we approach the 5-year anniversary of the acquisition of Debenhams from administration, it is clear that we are making good progress towards realising this medium term \u00a3multi-billion GMV opportunity with a c.20% EBITDA margin. We now have clear line of sight to the Debenhams brand delivering \u00a31bn GMV and \u00a350m+ EBITDA within 3 years.\nThe significant multi-year transformation of our Youth Brands is underway. All brands are now profitable on an Adjusted EBITDA basis with Boohoo, PLT and MAN each having started their marketplaces. Our focus is on profit and cash generation whilst revenue right sizes. These globally recognised brands have over 46.5m social media followers. Importantly, the GMV declines have improved quarter on quarter through the first three quarters of the financial year.\nWe have a n\new energised leadership team in place at Karen Millen. With\na new product strategy designed to strengthen brand identity and deliver sustained commercial performance\nas it transitions to be a premium global lifestyle destination. We see significant global license opportunities across footwear, accessories, home and beauty.\n32% of GMV is now generated through marketplace (19% at H125). This is enabling significant stock holding reduction to \u00a368m in H126 (-35% on H125 continuing operations, -50% on H125 total operations), as the stock lite model comes into effect. Similarly, Capex has reduced to \u00a37.5m in H126 (H125: \u00a314.9m, H124: \u00a336.3m) as we transition to capital lite.\nConsolidation of our warehousing operations is well underway and will complete this financial year. We previously invested \u00a3125m in world class automation at our Sheffield distribution centre (DC). This will be fully potentialised going forward with material operational improvements delivered. Our Daventry DC has been exited, our freehold Burnley DC is in the process of being sold and our US DC obligations will be exited.\nOur decisive cost elimination programme is nearing completion. We are transforming into a lean, tech-enabled, best in class online platform business.\nOur ongoing fixed cost base has been reduced by c.\u00a3160m (down from \u00a3292m at Feb-24). We expect our fixed costs to reach c.\u00a3100m in the near term. Significant variable cost reduction has been delivered from material operational improvements. This provides material EBITDA margin expansion opportunity and as we return to growth, the EBITDA growth opportunity is tremendous.\nAdjusted EBITDA of \u00a320.0m in H126, 5% ahead of H125 (total operations \u00a321.0m, 1% ahead of H125). Positive Adjusted EBIT of \u00a31.8m (H125:(\u00a39.2)m).\u00a0Statutory loss after tax for continuing operations significantly reduced to \u00a33.4m (H125: \u00a3126.7m).\nNet debt is down to \u00a3111m (H1 25: \u00a3143m). We expect net debt / EBITDA to be reduced by the end of the next financial year (28 February 2027) to <2x as the Group returns to cash generation and target <1x the year after. Disposals could bring forward this balance sheet strengthening.\nWe expect full year EBITDA to be approximately \u00a345m, for total operations. This is expected to grow double digits % in FY27.\nThe board considers the market valuation of the Group to be well below intrinsic value. We will continue to engage with investors to ensure the new Debenhams business model is fully understood and will recommence our investor roadshows.\nWe operate as Debenhams Group. We will formally change the name of Boohoo Group Plc to Debenhams Plc, as we previously tried, as soon as all major shareholders agree, as we believe that is in the best interest of all shareholders.\nSummary H1 2026 Performance\nGroup performance of continuing operations\n\u00a3 million\nH1 26\nH1 25\nChange\nGMV Pre Returns(1)\n630.8\n778.2\n-19%\n- Youth Brands\n258.0\n434.4\n-41%\n- Karen Millen\n54.0\n78.3\n-31%\n- Debenhams brand\n318.8\n265.5\n+20%\nGMV Post Returns(2)\n406.9\n529.7\n-23%\nRevenue\n296.9\n385.4\n-23%\nGross Profit\n157.2\n206.2\n-24%\nGross margin\n52.9%\n53.5%\n-60bps\nOperating costs\n(137.2)\n(187.2)\n-27%\nAdjusted EBITDA(3)\n20.0\n19.0\n+5%\n% of revenue\n6.7%\n4.9%\n180bps\nAdjusted EBITDA (total operations(4))\n21.0\n20.8\n+1%\n% of revenue\n5.0%\n3.4%\n160bps\nAdjusted EBIT(5)\n1.8\n(9.2)\n+119.3%\n% of revenue\n0.6%\n-2.4%\n300bps\nStatutory Loss after tax\n(3.4)\n(126.7)\n-97%\nStatutory Loss after tax (total operations)\n(14.7)\n(138.9)\n-89%\nInventory\n67.9\n104.9\n-35%\nCapex\n(7.5)\n(14.9)\n-50%\nFree cash flow(6)\n(22.1)\n(38.9)\n-43%\nNet debt\n(111.1)\n(143.1)\n-22%\nMarketplace Mix(7)\n31.6%\n19.0%\n1260bps\n(1) GMV pre returns is all merchandise sold to customers after cancellations and before returns, including VAT, carriage receipts and premier subscription income.\n(2) GMV post returns is all merchandise sold to customers after cancellations and after returns, including VAT, carriage receipts and premier subscription income.\n(3) Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as loss before tax, interest, depreciation, amortisation, share-based payment charges and exceptional items.\n(4) Total operations include both continuing and discontinued operations.\n(5) Adjusted EBIT is calculated as loss before tax, interest, amortisation of acquired intangible assets, share-based payment charges and exceptional items.\n(6) Free cash flow is defined as Net cash generated from activities, less cash used for capital expenditure for the total group.\n(7) GMV pre returns generated from External Marketplace sales divided by total Group GMV pre returns\nDan Finley, Group Chief Executive Officer, said:\nOur turnaround is gathering real pace. We are making progress, we are moving fast, and we are transforming the business. We have returned all our brands to profitability and grown adjusted EBITDA. These results show that our strategy is working.\nWe built this turnaround on three clear pillars: creating the right operating model, supercharging Debenhams, and pivoting our other brands into fashion-led marketplaces. We have simplified, we have focused, we are staying disciplined in how we execute, and we know there is more to do.\nDebenhams is leading the way. Its double-digit growth shows what is possible across the wider Group and reinforces that the marketplace model is the right one. Our Youth Brands and Karen Millen are following that lead, now fully marketplace enabled and profitable, with the foundations in place for their next phase of growth.\nThis is a multi-year journey, and we have a clear plan and the right model in place. We are transforming into a lean, tech-enabled, best in class online platform business. The momentum we have built in the first half sets us up well for the remainder of FY26 and we expect Adjusted EBITDA to be ahead of last year.\nInvestor & Analyst presentation and Q&A\nAn institutional investor and analyst presentation will be available on the https://www.debenhamsgroup.com/ website\u00a0here\u00a0from 7:30am on 27 November 2025.\nA Q&A session will be hosted at 9:00am on 27 November 2025 for institutional investors and analysts.\nEnquiries\nDebenhams Group\nPhil Ellis, Chief Financial Officer\nTel: +44 (0)161 233 2050\nZeus Capital - Nominated Advisor and Joint Broker\nDan Bate/ James Edis\nTel: +44 (0)161 831 1512\nBenjamin Robertson\nTel: +44 (0)20 3829 5000\nPanmure Liberum - Joint Broker\nMark Dickenson/ James Sinclair-Ford/ Shalin Bhamra\nSodali & Co - Financial PR Adviser\nTel: +44 (0)20 3100 2000\nBen Foster/ Louisa Henry\nTel: +44 (0)20 3984 0114\nDebenhamsgroup@client.sodali.com\nAbout Debenhams Group\nDebenhams Group is an online platform, for fashion, home, and beauty, serving millions of customers across five shopping destinations: Debenhams, Karen Millen, boohoo, MAN and PLT. Debenhams Group dates back to 1778 when William Clark, a retail pioneer of the time, opened the\u00a0UK's\u00a0first department store. Today, the Group is home to Debenhams, Britain's online department store and leading fashion-led marketplaces, boohoo, PLT, MAN, and Karen Millen.\nStrategic update\nDebenhams Group has embarked on a decisive, multi-year turnaround strategy designed to restore profitability and unlock value for all shareholders. The turnaround continues apace and is making strong progress.\nThere is still more to be delivered, and\nwe are executing a clear plan. We believe we have made strong progress against our 3 key strategic value drivers:\n1.\nCreating the right operating model\n\u00b7\nOur ongoing fixed cost base has been reduced by c.\u00a3160m (down from \u00a3292m at Feb-24). We expect our fixed costs to reach c.\u00a3100m in the near term.\n\u00b7\nConsolidation of our supply chain operations is well underway into our world class automated Sheffield site and will be complete this financial year, delivering c.\u00a320m annualised cost savings.\n\u00b7\nOur operations have been streamlined and inventory reduced by 35% during the period, reflecting continued progress towards a more efficient, stock-lite, capital-lite, cost-lite operating model.\n2. Supercharging the Debenhams brand\n\u00b7\nThe Debenhams brand continues to power ahead, with GMV growing 20% to \u00a3318.8m in H126.\n\u00b7\nAdjusted EBITDA at H126 is 50% ahead of last year, delivering a strong EBITDA margin c.15%.\n\u00b7\nThe marketplace continues to scale, with c.20k brands now in our ecosystem (up from c.10k a year ago). Latest additions include Jessops, Appliance World Online, Bodum and Brita.\n\u00b7\nWe continue to grow our geographical footprint and expand internationally with Debenhams brand marketplaces now live in Ireland, Australia and the US.\n\u00b7\nIn September, we have launched a number of our brands, including Coast, Warehouse, Oasis, Nasty Gal and Karen Millen, on Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Nordstrom online marketplace. Attracting over 350 million shoppers each month, this marks significant penetration into the US market for the Group. A new collaboration with Amazon Fashion in the US will bring Nasty Gal to over 250 million shoppers on the Amazon platform.\n\u00b7\nIn October we relaunched the much-loved Designers at Debenhams. The AW25 collection launched with Ashish, fronted by actress Kim Cattrall, bringing wearable pieces to the high street and making runway fashion accessible.\n3. Pivot to fashion-led marketplaces\n\u00b7\nThe significant multi-year transformation of our Youth Brands is underway. Our marketplace model is at the heart of our go forward business.\nAll our Group brands are now marketplace enabled, leveraging our proprietary technology ecosystem.\n\u00b7\nAll our brands are now profitable at adjusted EBITDA level. Our focus is on profit and cash generation whilst revenue right sizes. In line with our expectations, GMV declines have significantly improved quarter on quarter through the first three quarters of the financial year.\n\u00b7\nDriving marketplace-led growth remains central to the turnaround strategy and the Group continues to accelerate its transition to a marketplace model. This strategic shift will position the Group to deliver sustainable, higher-margin growth through a capital-lite, stock-lite, cost-lite and cash generative operating model.\n\u00b7\nWe have a n\new energised leadership team in place at Karen Millen. With a new product strategy designed to strengthen brand identity and deliver sustained commercial performance as it transitions to be a premium global lifestyle destination. We see significant global license opportunities across footwear, accessories, home and beauty.\nUpdate on sustainability\nDuring the first half of the year, the Group achieved further progress against its 2025 Environmental, Social and Governance priorities. We updated in March on our partnership with Segura, and we're pleased to confirm strong progress, with all suppliers now having been successfully onboarded onto the Segura platform. This is a key step in developing a comprehensive grading of our Tier 1 factories. Our partnership with Pennies grows stronger and the roll-out so far has enabled customers to raise over \u00a3120,000 for the British Heart Foundation, with further expansion of this initiative planned across additional brands.\nReview of the business\nGroup overview\nThe turnaround continues apace. The Group continues to execute its strategic transformation, consolidating its cost base, reducing complexity, focusing on profitable growth and cash generation. H126 results demonstrate that the turnaround is progressing apace.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nincreased to \u00a320.0m (H125: \u00a319.0m), total operations \u00a321.0m (H125: \u00a320.8m). Adjusted EBITDA margin increased 180bps against last year supported by cost out actions and the shift to marketplace. Adjusted EBIT improved to \u00a31.8m (H125: \u00a3(9.2)m).\nStatutory losses significantly reduced to \u00a33.4m (H125: \u00a3126.7m).\nGMV Pre Returns for continuing operations was \u00a3630.8m, down 19% year on year, largely due to the reduction in Youth Brand sales. The significant transformation within the Youth Brands is underway, with\nfocus on profit and cash generation.\nAll brands are now profitable.\nImportantly, GMV declines have significantly improved quarter on quarter through the first three quarters of the financial year.\nThe Debenhams brand continues to power ahead, with GMV growing 20% to \u00a3318.8m in H126. Adjusted EBITDA at H126 is 50% ahead of last year, delivering a strong EBITDA margin c.15%.\nRevenue was \u00a3296.9m, down 23%, consistent with the increasing mix of marketplace activity where only commission income is recognised.\nGross margin remained broadly stable at 52.9%, reflecting the shift in sales mix toward marketplace. Operating costs were reduced by 27%, highlighting the success of the Group's ongoing cost-reduction programme.\nExceptional costs before tax were \u00a315.3m in H126 in comparison to \u00a3(101.5)m in H125. In H126 Exceptional costs for continuing operations consisted of:\n\u00b7\n\u00a334.3m Lease-write back right of use assets relating to the lease reassignment of Daventry distribution centre;\n\u00b7\n\u00a3(13.6)m costs in relation to restructuring and dual operating costs relating to the consolidation of our distribution centres and the closure of our Burnley distribution centre;\n\u00b7\n\u00a3(3.1)m restructuring costs;\n\u00b7\n\u00a3(1.0)m costs relating to the consolidation of properties;\n\u00b7\n\u00a3(1.0)m technology platform dual running costs relating to the cost of migrating brands to our proprietary marketplace technology platform; and\n\u00b7\n\u00a3(0.3)m professional fees.\nFurther information in relation to Exceptional costs can be found in Note 1.\nGroup remains focused on driving efficiency and cash generation, with clear progress made on cost optimisation, improved working capital management, and the continued pivot to its marketplace model.\nCash and Working Capital Management\nThe Group delivered strong progress in working capital management during H126, reflecting the continued focus on cash generation, operational discipline, and a stock-lite, capital-lite model.\nOperating cash outflow was \u00a314.7m (H125: \u00a324.0m outflow), driven by lower trading volumes offset by a material reduction in costs and inventory.\n32% of GMV is now generated through marketplace (19% LY). This is enabling significant stock holding reduction to \u00a368m in H126 (-35% on H125 continuing operations, -50% on H125 total operations), as the stock lite model comes into effect.\nSimilarly, capex has reduced to \u00a37.5m in H126 (H125: \u00a314.9m, H124: \u00a336.3m) as we transition to capital lite.\nFree cash outflow after tax improved to \u00a312.6m (H125: \u00a338.9m outflow), reflecting the lower capex and efficiency gains.\nNet debt improved to \u00a3111.1m (H125: \u00a3143.1m).\nIn August 2025, the Group announced the completion of a new 3-year facility providing access to funding of up to \u00a3175 million, which extends maturity to August 2028. This replaces\u00a0the Group's\u00a0previous\u00a0\u00a3125 million revolving credit facility originally due to mature in October 2026. As a result of the decisive actions taken by the new management team Interest bearing loans and borrowings decreased from \u00a3275.0m as at H125 to \u00a3141.4 as at H126, a 48.6% reduction.\nPerformance by market\nDebenhams\nDebenhams continues to provide the blueprint for the wider Group's transformation, delivering 20% GMV growth to \u00a3318.8m (H125: \u00a3265.5m). Acceleration of the marketplace proposition, supported by growth in its Beauty channel continue to propel the Debenhams GMV growth.\nProfitability is strong, Adjusted EBITDA +50% ahead of last year, delivering a strong EBITDA margin of c.15%.\nYouth Brands\nYouth Brands GMV decreased 41% to \u00a3258.0m (H125: \u00a3434.4m), reflecting the rationalisation of unprofitable lines, unprofitable customers and continued softness in the youth fashion segment.\nThese globally recognised brands have over 46.5m social media followers.\nThe focus remains on sustainable, profitable growth and cash generation, leveraging the Group's proprietary marketplace technology platform.\nAll brands are now profitable, on an Adjusted EBITDA basis. Importantly,\nGMV declines have significantly improved quarter on quarter through the first three quarters of the financial year.\nPLT remains as an asset held for sale. The board believes a strategic sale is an opportunity to maximise shareholder value.\nKaren Millen\nKaren Millen GMV declined 31% to \u00a354.0m (H125: \u00a378.0m).\nThe brand continues to deliver strong H1 26 margin performance through disciplined inventory management and selective investment in licensing and third-party partnerships, which support a capital-lite growth model. The brand continues to be profitable, on an Adjusted EBITDA basis.\nImportantly,\nGMV declines have significantly improved quarter on quarter through the first three quarters of the financial year.\nNew leadership team in place at Karen Millen as it transitions to premium global lifestyle destination.\nFINANCIAL REVIEW\nConsolidated summary income statement for continuing operations\n6 months to\n31 August\n2025\n6 months to\n31 August\n2024\nChange\nHY26\non HY25\n\u00a3 million\n\u00a3 million\nGMV Pre Returns\n630.8\n778.2\n(19%)\nRevenue\n296.9\n385.4\n(23%)\nCost of sales\n(139.7)\n(179.2)\n(22%)\nGross profit for continuing operations\n157.2\n206.2\n(24%)\nGross margin %\n52.9%\n53.5%\n(60bps)\nOperating costs\n(137.5)\n(187.9)\n(27%)\nOther income\n0.3\n0.7\nAdjusted EBITDA for continuing operations\n20.0\n19.0\n5%\nAdjusted EBITDA margin %\n6.7%\n4.9%\n180bps\nDepreciation\n(9.6)\n(16.3)\nAmortisation of other intangible assets\n(8.6)\n(11.9)\nAdjusted EBIT for continuing operations\n1.8\n(9.2)\n(20%)\nAdjusting items:\nAmortisation of acquired intangible assets\n(3.3)\n(3.4)\nEquity-settled share-based payments charges\n(7.2)\n(6.3)\nExceptional items and impairments\n15.3\n(101.5)\nOperating profit / (loss) for continuing operations\n6.6\n(120.4)\n(5%)\nFinance income\n3.1\n2.6\nFinance expense\n(12.2)\n(12.2)\nLoss before tax for continuing operations\n(2.5)\n(130.0)\n(98%)\nTaxation\n(0.9)\n3.3\nLoss after tax for continuing operations\n(3.4)\n(126.7)\n(97%)\nShare of results of associates\n-\n-\nLoss for the period for continuing operations\n(3.4)\n(126.7)\n(97%)\nLoss per share for continuing operations\n(0.51)p\n(1.49)p\n(97%)\nAdjusted loss after tax for the period for continuing operations\n(7.0)\n(17.9)\n(61%)\nAmortisation of acquired intangible assets\n(3.3)\n(3.4)\nEquity-settled share-based payments charges\n(7.2)\n(6.3)\nImpairment of assets\n-\n(93.3)\nExceptional costs\n15.3\n(8.2)\nAdjustment for tax\n(1.2)\n2.4\nLoss after tax for the period for continuing operations\n(3.4)\n(126.7)\n(97%)\nAdjusted diluted per loss per share\n(0.48)p\n(1.39)p\n(11%)\n(Exceptional items and impairment of assets amounted to (\u00a315.3)m (H125: 101.5m) and are shown in more detail in note 1 of the financial statements.

information\nboohoo group plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in Jersey and listed on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) of the London Stock Exchange. Its registered office address is: 12 Castle Street, St Helier, Jersey, JE2 3RT. The company was incorporated on 19 November 2013.\nBasis of preparation\nThe interim condensed financial statements for the six months to 31 August 2025 have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34, \"Interim Financial Reporting\" as adopted by the UK. The interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the group's Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 28 February 2025, prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.\nThe interim condensed financial statements contained in this report are not audited and do not constitute statutory accounts within the meaning of Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. The Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 28 February 2025 has been filed with the Jersey Companies Registry. The auditors' report on those accounts was unqualified and did not include reference to any matters on which the auditors were required to report by exception under Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.\nThe group's business activities together with the factors that are likely to affect its future developments, performance and position are set out in the Business and Financial Reviews. The Financial Review describes the group's financial position, cash flows and bank facilities.\nThe interim financial statements are unaudited and were approved by the board of directors on 26 November 2025.\nGoing concern\nThe directors have reviewed the group's forecast and projections, including assumptions concerning capital expenditure and expenditure commitments and their impact on cash flows, and have a reasonable expectation that the group has adequate financial resources to continue its operations for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they have continued to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.\nIn preparing the interim announcement, the directors have also made reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates and prepared the interim announcement on the going concern basis. The interim announcement and management report contained herein give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit and loss of the group.\nAccounting policies\nThe interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies set out in the group's Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 28 February 2025.\nSignificant estimates and judgements\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS as adopted by the UK requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates and any subsequent changes are accounted for when such information becomes available. The judgements, estimates and assumptions that are the most subjective or complex are discussed below and are unchanged from those at 28 February 2025.\nExceptional items and impairment of assets\nExceptional items are those of significant size and of a non-recurring nature that require disclosure in order that the underlying business performance can be identified. The exceptional costs in these interim statements include additional costs associated with the restructuring of warehousing facilities and onerous contracts. Such additional costs do require estimation by management.\nExceptional costs and impairment of assets\n(continuing operations)\n6 months to\n31 August\n2025\n6 months to\n31 August\n2024\n\u00a3 million\n\u00a3 million\nCost of sales\nUSA warehouse closure - stock provision\n-\n0.3\n-\n0.3\nSelling and distribution costs\nUSA warehouse ROU asset impairment\n-\n64.5\nUSA warehouse fixtures & fittings impairment\n-\n28.8\nUK warehouse restructuring and post-closure expenditure\n-\n2.7\nDe-recognition of lease liabilities\n(34.3)\n-\nUK Warehouse restructuring and dual operating costs\n13.6\n-\nUK property related costs\n1.0\n-\n(19.7)\n96.0\nAdministration expenses\nTechnology platform - dual running costs\n1.0\n2.2\nRefinancing of debt facility - advisor fees\n-\n2.3\nUSA warehouse closure expenditure - administrative costs\n-\n0.6\nRestructuring costs\n3.1\n-\nProfessional fees\n0.3\n-\nUK warehouse post-closure expenditure - administrative costs\n-\n0.1\n4.4\n5.2\nTotal before tax\n(15.3)\n101.5\nTax\n3.8\n(1.8)\nTotal after tax\n(11.5)\n99.7\nExceptional costs and impairment of assets\n(discontinued operations)\n6 months to\n31 August\n2025\n6 months to\n31 August\n2024\n\u00a3 million\n\u00a3 million\nCost of sales\nUSA warehouse closure - stock provision\n0.0\n5.4\n0.0\n5.4\nSelling and distribution costs\nRestructuring Costs\n4.4\n-\nUSA Warehouse associated closure costs\n0.3\n1.3\n4.7\n1.3\nAdministration expenses\nRestructuring costs\n0.8\n0.5\n0.8\n0.5\nTotal before tax\n5.5\n7.2\nTax\n(1.4)\n(0.1)\nTotal after tax\n4.1\n7.1\n2\nPrincipal risks and uncertainties\nThe board considers the principal risks and uncertainties which could impact the group over the remaining six months of the financial year to 28 February 2026 to be unchanged from those set out in the group's Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 28 February 2025, which in summary are: supply chain ethics, competition risk; sustainability, governance, ethos and culture, regulatory compliance, taxation and duties, supply chain costs, IT and cyber security, business change, third parties, business continuity, people, product and financial risk.
