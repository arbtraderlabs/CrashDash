          "full_content": "27 Nov 2025 07:01\nRNS Number : 1895J\nBoohoo Group Plc\n27 November 2025\nboohoo group plc\n(\"Debenhams Group\", \"Debenhams\" or the \"Company\")\nGroup Turnaround Scheme\nThe Remuneration Committee of Debenhams Group (DEBS.L) (the \"\nCommittee\n\") announces a new growth share arrangement, the Group Turnaround Scheme (the \"\nGTS\n\").\nBackground and Rationale\nFollowing the appointment of the new management team, the Committee has undertaken a comprehensive review of the Debenhams Group's remuneration policy to ensure it is fair, appropriate and closely aligned with Debenhams' multi-year turnaround strategy. The Debenhams Group's existing long term incentive schemes based on the performance of the whole Debenhams Group do not include Dan Finley (CEO) and Phil Ellis (CFO) (the\n\"Executives\"\n). Accordingly, the Committee has determined that these legacy schemes no longer incentivise the individuals that are fundamental to the Debenhams Group's future success and is proposing to replace participation in these schemes with the GTS.\nThe GTS has been designed to be a strong incentive for the Executives and certain other members of the senior management team (the \"\nParticipants\n\") to execute the turnaround strategy over the coming years and consequently restore profitability and unlock value for all shareholders.\nSignificant progress has already been made by the new leadership team to stabilise the business and position it to take advantage of opportunities. \u00a341.6m Adjusted EBITDA was reported for FY25, which reflected not only the stand-out performance of Debenhams but also the decisive actions taken by the new leadership team. The new leadership team have been instrumental in deleveraging the business following the completion of an oversubscribed equity raise of \u00a339m in December 2024, the sale of non-core property assets enabling early payment of the Debenhams Group's previous term loan and the successful completion of a new 3-year finance facility of up to \u00a3175m, more than 12 months ahead of maturity. Whilst progress has been made, the new leadership team have embarked upon a focused, multi-year turnaround strategy to restore profitability and unlock value and, as such, the GTS is intended to retain and incentivise the management team to deliver.\nThe Company has conducted a shareholder consultation process with respect to the GTS with a number of the Company's shareholders, representing 36% of the voting rights. This exercise has provided valuable feedback which has been taken on board in finalising the terms of the GTS, which have been approved by the Committee.\nCorporate Governance Considerations\nDebenhams notes that its Board has previously stated publicly that, having taken advice from Zeus Capital Limited, its Nominated Adviser, seeking shareholder support for management incentive schemes of this nature is consistent with its corporate governance aims. Debenhams has adhered to this principle in the adoption of each of its legacy executive schemes since June 2020 (\"\nPrevious Schemes\n\") by requiring the adoption of those schemes to be subject to shareholder approval at a general meeting.\nHowever, after careful consideration, the Board has concluded that making the adoption of the GTS conditional on shareholder approval at a general meeting would not be most likely to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its shareholders as a whole.\nThe principal reasons for this are as follows:\n\u00b7\nthere is no requirement under relevant company law or the AIM Rules to obtain shareholder approval before implementing the GTS;\n\u00b7\nthe Committee has carefully considered the structure of the GTS and, through the stretching growth targets and duration of the plan, sought to ensure it retains and incentivises management to drive sustained share price growth;\n\u00b7\nthe swift adoption of the GTS ensures that the senior managers (and most importantly the Executives) will be incentivised to deliver very significant share price growth as the Debenhams Group executes its strategy under the leadership of the Executives. As outlined above, significant progress has already been made by the new leadership team which has had a positive impact on the Debenhams Group's overall performance. As a result, the Committee believes implementing the GTS without delay is fundamental to maintaining this upward trajectory and enabling the Participants to solely focus on executing the turnaround strategy and creating value for all shareholders;\n\u00b7\nthe Company has undertaken shareholder consultation with a number of its key shareholders and taken on board feedback received; and\n\u00b7\na major competitor who is a significant shareholder of Debenhams continues to seek to disrupt the Debenhams Group's growth strategy and operations rather than maximise its future success; at the Debenhams general meeting on the 28 March 2025, it voted against a simple resolution to change the Company's corporate name and at the annual general meeting on 19 September 2025 it voted against cu",

          "full_content": "27 Nov 2025 07:00\nRNS Number : 1808J\nBoohoo Group Plc\n27 November 2025\n27 November 2025\nboohoo group plc\n(the \"Company\" or the \"Group\" or \"Debenhams Group\")\nResults for the six months ended 31 August 2025\nThe turnaround continues apace:\nProgress on strategic transformation and disciplined execution driving a return to profitability across all brands.\nHighlights - H1 2026\nThe turnaround continues apace:\nProgress on strategic transformation and disciplined execution driving a return to profitability across all\nbrands.\nThe Group turnaround is well underway with the Debenhams brand continuing to grow with H126 GMV +20% and EBITDA +50% (compared to H125) with an EBITDA margin of c.15%.\nOur marketplace model is at the heart of our go forward business. It is stock lite, capital lite, margin rich and highly cash generative. This will improve further as we\u00a0continue to grow our take rate and realise the potential of our recent AI investments across the business.\nThere are now c.20k partners in our ecosystem (up from c.10k a year ago) and we see significant further partner growth potential. All our Group brands are now marketplace enabled, leveraging our proprietary technology ecosystem.\nAs we approach the 5-year anniversary of the acquisition of Debenhams from administration, it is clear that we are making good progress towards realising this medium term \u00a3multi-billion GMV opportunity with a c.20% EBITDA margin. We now have clear line of sight to the Debenhams brand delivering \u00a31bn GMV and \u00a350m+ EBITDA within 3 years.\nThe significant multi-year transformation of our Youth Brands is underway. All brands are now profitable on an Adjusted EBITDA basis with Boohoo, PLT and MAN each having started their marketplaces. Our focus is on profit and cash generation whilst revenue right sizes. These globally recognised brands have over 46.5m social media followers. Importantly, the GMV declines have improved quarter on quarter through the first three quarters of the financial year.\nWe have a n\new energised leadership team in place at Karen Millen. With\na new product strategy designed to strengthen brand identity and deliver sustained commercial performance\nas it transitions to be a premium global lifestyle destination. We see significant global license opportunities across footwear, accessories, home and beauty.\n32% of GMV is now generated through marketplace (19% at H125). This is enabling significant stock holding reduction to \u00a368m in H126 (-35% on H125 continuing operations, -50% on H125 total operations), as the stock lite model comes into effect. Similarly, Capex has reduced to \u00a37.5m in H126 (H125: \u00a314.9m, H124: \u00a336.3m) as we transition to capital lite.\nConsolidation of our warehousing operations is well underway and will complete this financial year. We previously invested \u00a3125m in world class automation at our Sheffield distribution centre (DC). This will be fully potentialised going forward with material operational improvements delivered. Our Daventry DC has been exited, our freehold Burnley DC is in the process of being sold and our US DC obligations will be exited.\nOur decisive cost elimination programme is nearing completion. We are transforming into a lean, tech-enabled, best in class online platform business.\nOur ongoing fixed cost base has been reduced by c.\u00a3160m (down from \u00a3292m at Feb-24). We expect our fixed costs to reach c.\u00a3100m in the near term. Significant variable cost reduction has been delivered from material operational improvements. This provides material EBITDA margin expansion opportunity and as we return to growth, the EBITDA growth opportunity is tremendous.\nAdjusted EBITDA of \u00a320.0m in H126, 5% ahead of H125 (total operations \u00a321.0m, 1% ahead of H125). Positive Adjusted EBIT of \u00a31.8m (H125:(\u00a39.2)m).\u00a0Statutory loss after tax for continuing operations significantly reduced to \u00a33.4m (H125: \u00a3126.7m).\nNet debt is down to \u00a3111m (H1 25: \u00a3143m). We expect net debt / EBITDA to be reduced by the end of the next financial year (28 February 2027) to <2x as the Group returns to cash generation and target <1x the year after. Disposals could bring forward this balance sheet strengthening.\nWe expect full year EBITDA to be approximately \u00a345m, for total operations. This is expected to grow double digits % in FY27.\nThe board considers the market valuation of the Group to be well below intrinsic value. We will continue to engage with investors to ensure the new Debenhams business model is fully understood and will recommence our investor roadshows.\nWe operate as Debenhams Group. We will formally change the name of Boohoo Group Plc to Debenhams Plc, as we previously tried, as soon as all major shareholders agree, as we believe that is in the best interest of all shareholders.\nSummary H1 2026 Performance\nGroup performance of continuing operations\n\u00a3 million\nH1 26\nH1 25\nChange\nGMV Pre Returns(1)\n630.8\n778.2\n-19%\n- Youth Brands\n258.0\n434.4\n-41%\n- Karen Millen\n54.0\n78.3\n-31%\n- Debenhams brand\n318.8\n265.5\n+20%\nGMV Post Retu",

Resolution 2, an advisory resolution, was approved by a majority of shareholders. The Remuneration Committee sets the remuneration policy to attract and retain the leadership team, and to align against delivery of the Group's strategy.\nIt comes as no surprise that as a result of the voting of the major competitor, the special resolutions numbered 11, 12 and 13 have not been passed, despite over 98% of other shareholders voting in favour.\nThese special resolutions were in customary form and of a type which are regularly recommended by boards as being in the best interests of all shareholders. Whilst these special resolutions have not been passed, the Board would like to reassure shareholders that this is not expected to have any material impact on the Group going forwards. The Board remains firmly focused on delivering the turnaround strategy and maximising value for all shareholders.\nThe Board and the Committee will continue to consider shareholder perspectives as appropriate.\nThe full text of the resolutions is set out in the Notice of Meeting dated 27 August 2025 which is available at\nwww.debenhamsgroup.com\n.\nFor further information, please contact:\nDebenhams Group\nPhil Ellis, Chief Financial Officer\nTel: +44 (0)161 233 2050\nZeus Capital - Nominated Advisor and Joint Broker\nDan Bate / James Edis\nTel: +44 (0)161 831 1512\nBenjamin Robertson\nTel: +44 (0)20 3829 5000\nPanmure Liberum - Joint Broker\nMax Jones / Ailsa MacMaster / Gaya Bhatt\nTel: +44 (0)20 3100 2000\nSodali & Co - Financial PR Adviser\nBen Foster / Louisa Henry\nTel: +44 (0)20 3984 0114\nAbout Debenhams Group\nDebenhams Group is a leading online retailer in fashion, home, and beauty, serving millions of customers across five shopping destinations: Debenhams, Karen Millen, boohoo, MAN and PLT.

The Board recognised the need for change following a long period of sustained and unacceptable underperformance. My immediate focus has been on stabilising the business and positioning it to take advantage of the significant opportunities ahead. I am laser focused on maximising value for all shareholders.\nWe\nare pleased to report \u00a341.6m Adjusted EBITDA\n[1]\nfor FY25. On appointment, this seemed improbable, but we quickly came up with a plan, confirmed our position with the market and executed it. This has only been possible due to the aggressive actions subsequently taken, including \u00a350m of annualised headcount savings. The highlight of the year has been the standout performance of the Debenhams brand, growing GMV\n[2]\nto \u00a3654m (+34% YOY) and with Adjusted EBITDA of \u00a325m (+ \u00a314m YOY). The Debenhams capital-lite, stock-lite, cost-lite, cash-generative marketplace model sits at the heart of our new strategy. The multi-year turnaround of Debenhams is the blueprint for the turnaround of the wider group.\nWe have significantly reduced the capital intensity of the business. We have faced into legacy stock issues and reduced our stock holding by more than 50%. We have stopped unnecessary capital expenditure and reduced capex by more than 50%. Further reductions will be delivered this financial year.\nWe have significantly deleveraged the business in H2. Our gross borrowings reduced by \u00a3200m, with net debt of \u00a378.2m at year end (1H FY25: \u00a3143.1m, FY24 \u00a395.0m). This follows the successful completion of an oversubscribed equity raise of \u00a339m and the sale of non-core property assets, enabling us to pay off our term loan nine months early. Post year end, we announced the successful completion of a new 3-year finance facility of up to \u00a3175m. This was done more than 12 months ahead of maturity to align our financing to our new strategy.\nThe business has been through a very challenging period which is reflected in these results. I want to assure shareholders that the business is taking the necessary actions, quickly and decisively, to address the challenges that we face. No stone will be left unturned.\nAs outlined in March, we have a clear plan as Debenhams Group to transform the business and a route map to generating sustainable profit growth. Our mission is to become the shopping destination of choice by connecting our community with the brands they love.\nWe are focused on delivering on the huge opportunity ahead for the Debenhams brand. Work is progressing to reposition and right size the Youth Brands, with a laser focus on profitability and cash generation under new management.\nThis will be a multi-year turnaround as was the case with the Debenhams brand. As part of our ongoing business review, we are exploring a potential sale of PLT. We are also assessing long-term options for our US and Burnley distribution sites to enhance efficiency and ensure alignment with our stock-lite strategy.\nI am pleased that all our brands are now trading profitably in terms of Adjusted EBITDA. I strongly believe in the medium-term opportunity for our group. We continue forward as Debenhams Group under new leadership, a new strategy, and a new direction.\nSummary FY2025 Performance\nGroup performance of continuing operations (excluding PLT)\n1\nGroup performance including discontinued operations (including PLT)\n\u00a3 million\nFY25\nFY24\nChange\nFY25\nFY24\nChange\nGMV2 Pre Returns3\nYouth Brands\nKaren Millen\nDebenhams brand\n1,606.8\n795.6\n157.1\n654.0\n1,632.5\n981.9\n161.9\n488.7\n(2)%\n(19)%\n(3)%\n34%\n2,321.8\n1,510.6\n157.1\n654.0\n2,581.4\n1,930.8\n161.9\n488.7\n(10)%\n(22)%\n(3)%\n34%\nGMV Post Returns4\n1,137.4\n1,121.7\n1%\n1,639.0\n1,784.7\n(8)%\nRevenue\n790.3\n902.3\n(12)%\n1,217.9\n1,461.0\n(17)%\nGross profit\n415.8\n479.3\n(13)%\n617.9\n756.1\n(18)%\nGross margin\n52.6%\n53.1%\n(50)bps\n50.7%\n51.8%\n(100)bps\nOperating costs\n(375.5)\n(440.2)\n(15)%\n-\n-\n-\nAdjusted EBITDA5\n41.6\n40.4\n3.0%\n39.6\n58.7\n(33)%\n% of revenue\n5.3%\n4.5%\n80bps\nAdjusted EBIT6\n(21.0)\n(30.7)\n32%\n% of revenue\n(2.7)%\n(3.4)%\n70bps\nAdjusted loss after tax7\n(43.4)\n(49.2)\n12%\nAdjusted diluted loss per share8\n(3.34)p\n(4.12)p\n19%\nInventory\n72.2\n208.0\n(65)%\nCapex\n27.5\n64.8\n(58)%\nFree cash flow\n(40.2)\n(62.9)\n36%\nNet debt\n(78.2)\n(95.0)\n(18)%\n1\nThe Group is actively pursuing a disposal of PLT through a sale process as the board believes this is an opportunity to accelerate progress and maximise shareholder value.

Most importantly - next doesn't have a chairman that uses the company as a cash pot to buy family companies and pay the families property portfolio off while driving the company to the brink of failure and also into a huge debt pile while also taking huge bonuses. Face it these morons have destroyed every single brand and label apart from debenhams and now people are praying that debenhams can save the company.... Look at nastygal for instance - they have watched revenue on that \"brand\" fall from 140 million to about 15 million, with profit of 14 million turning to a loss of over 12 million and they don't know how to stop it...  Nastygal is even still paying the mortgage on a Kamani property! The reality is nastygal could be run from a bedroom. You see why next and the boohoo group can't be compared??",

She was in town for a visit from Manchester, England, where Boohoo is based and where Nasty Gal now has its own, larger office. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of the jewel right now,\u201d Carol Kane, cofounder of Boohoo, said of Nasty Gal. She was until earlier this year the company\u2019s co-chief executive officer with Mahmud Kamani, but both moved into new roles, her as executive director, he as executive chairman, as John Lyttle came in from Primark to be ceo.

Nastgal latest figures Revenue 24 million (will be 15 this year) Loss 10 million Net liabilities 29 plus million Resulting situation - nastygal is worthless junk. Notably the company has said nowhere in its news releases that nastygal has been deprioritised, this is just an excuse for people that can't see all the failures. When will nastygal go bang?? Then the other brands!? When a companies liability exceeds its income... If a company's net liabilities (total liabilities minus total assets) exceed its revenue, it signals severe financial distress, indicating negative equity, meaning it owes more than it owns, risking insolvency, making it hard to get credit, and potentially leading to bankruptcy or restructuring, as it struggles to meet obligations despite earning. What This Means (Balance Sheet Insolvency): Negative Net Worth: Assets (what the company owns) are less than its liabilities (what it owes), resulting in negative shareholder equity. Insolvency: The business is technically insolvent (Balance Sheet Insolvency), meaning its liabilities outweigh its assets, not necessarily that it can't pay immediate bills (that's Cash Flow Insolvency). Strained Financial Health: This is a major red flag, showing instability and a poor ability to cover debts if liquidated. Consequences: Difficulty Securing Funding: Investors and lenders see high risk, making it hard to get loans or new investment. Poor Supplier/Creditor Relations: Suppliers may demand upfront payment, worsening cash flow. Risk of Bankruptcy: The company may not be able to survive and could face forced liquidation or restructuring. Why It's Worse Than Just Low Revenue: Revenue is an income statement item (profitability over time), while net liabilities relate to the balance sheet (assets vs. debts at a specific point). A company can have revenue but still be drowning in debt if its assets are worth far less than its obligations. In essence, it's a sign the business is underwater and in serious financial trouble, requiring urgent action to improve its asset base or reduce debt.",

          "content": "I wouldn't count to much on this adjusted ebitda lad... Adjusted ebitda isn't really worth the words coming out of Dans mouth. A company can fall into administration even when its adjusted EBITDA is positive. While a positive adjusted EBITDA indicates that the core business operations are generating profit on paper, it does not guarantee that the company is generating sufficient cash flow to meet its immediate financial obligations. Administration is a cash-flow insolvency issue, whereas EBITDA is a profitability metric. Why Positive Adjusted EBITDA Does Not Prevent Administration EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation, and Amortisation) is often used to measure operational performance, but it ignores several critical factors that can cause a company to fail: Cash Flow Shortfalls: A company can be profitable on paper but have no cash in the bank to pay creditors, salaries, or tax debts. High Debt Servicing (Interest): Adjusted EBITDA adds back interest expenses, which masks the burden of debt repayments. If interest payments exceed operating cash flow, the company may fail. Capital Expenditure (CapEx): EBITDA ignores the cash spent on maintaining or upgrading machinery, property, or equipment. In asset-heavy industries, these costs can be substantial, making a \"positive EBITDA\" company cash-negative. Working Capital Requirements: A growing company might have high sales (positive EBITDA) but burn through cash by financing inventory or waiting for customers to pay invoices. Aggressive Adjustments: \"Adjusted\" EBITDA often adds back non-recurring costs. If these \"one-time\" costs become recurring, or if the adjustments are too aggressive, the true financial picture is much weaker than reported. Common Reasons for Insolvency with Positive EBITDA Refinancing Failure: A company may be able to pay interest but cannot repay a large balloon payment of debt principal when it matures. Creditor Pressure: If creditors (like HMRC or suppliers) are not paid on time, they can petition to wind up the company, forcing it into insolvency regardless of its EBITDA. Sudden Cash Shock: A loss of a major customer, rapid increase in raw material costs, or litigation costs can drain cash reserves, despite a healthy operational EBITDA. In summary, EBITDA is not a substitute for cash flow. A company with positive adjusted EBITDA is only safe if that profit successfully converts into cash to pay its debts.",

Are these figures for just \u2018apparel and fashion\u2019 or the whole Debs marketplace so that you are not comparing like for like? 2. As it is a marketplace a lot less revenue will be generated per visit than companies like Next if the conversion rates are similar - maybe as low as 10% versus non-market place.  In other words you would expect a relatively high number of visits for such a model compared to those less structured that way. 3.  Unfortunately posters have banged on for years whenever these figures have looked good but they have proven hopelessly unreliable when it comes to being a forecaster of positive results. So forgive me but I\u2019ll wait for actual results for revenue and, more importantly, cash flow or profit before getting excited.",

Look at nastygal for instance - they have watched revenue on that \"brand\" fall from 140 million to about 15 million, with profit of 14 million turning to a loss of over 12 million and they don't know how to stop it...  Nastygal is even still paying the mortgage on a Kamani property! The reality is nastygal could be run from a bedroom. You see why next and the boohoo group can't be compared??",

She was in town for a visit from Manchester, England, where Boohoo is based and where Nasty Gal now has its own, larger office. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of the jewel right now,\u201d Carol Kane, cofounder of Boohoo, said of Nasty Gal. She was until earlier this year the company\u2019s co-chief executive officer with Mahmud Kamani, but both moved into new roles, her as executive director, he as executive chairman, as John Lyttle came in from Primark to be ceo. Kane led the acquisition with Kamani of Nasty Gal, and now oversees all of its creative and marketing efforts, so is understandably pleased with where the brand\u2019s business is, compared to where it was when Boohoo bought it out of bankruptcy at the start of 2017.",

Nastgal latest figures Revenue 24 million (will be 15 this year) Loss 10 million Net liabilities 29 plus million Resulting situation - nastygal is worthless junk. Notably the company has said nowhere in its news releases that nastygal has been deprioritised, this is just an excuse for people that can't see all the failures. When will nastygal go bang?? Then the other brands!? When a companies liability exceeds its income... If a company's net liabilities (total liabilities minus total assets) exceed its revenue, it signals severe financial distress, indicating negative equity, meaning it owes more than it owns, risking insolvency, making it hard to get credit, and potentially leading to bankruptcy or restructuring, as it struggles to meet obligations despite earning. What This Means (Balance Sheet Insolvency): Negative Net Worth: Assets (what the company owns) are less than its liabilities (what it owes), resulting in negative shareholder equity. Insolvency: The business is technically insolvent (Balance Sheet Insolvency), meaning its liabilities outweigh its assets, not necessarily that it can't pay immediate bills (that's Cash Flow Insolvency). Strained Financial Health: This is a major red flag, showing instability and a poor ability to cover debts if liquidated. Consequences: Difficulty Securing Funding: Investors and lenders see high risk, making it hard to get loans or new investment. Poor Supplier/Creditor Relations: Suppliers may demand upfront payment, worsening cash flow. Risk of Bankruptcy: The company may not be able to survive and could face forced liquidation or restructuring. Why It's Worse Than Just Low Revenue: Revenue is an income statement item (profitability over time), while net liabilities relate to the balance sheet (assets vs. debts at a specific point). A company can have revenue but still be drowning in debt if its assets are worth far less than its obligations. In essence, it's a sign the business is underwater and in serious financial trouble, requiring urgent action to improve its asset base or reduce debt.",

          "content": "I wouldn't count to much on this adjusted ebitda lad... Adjusted ebitda isn't really worth the words coming out of Dans mouth. A company can fall into administration even when its adjusted EBITDA is positive. While a positive adjusted EBITDA indicates that the core business operations are generating profit on paper, it does not guarantee that the company is generating sufficient cash flow to meet its immediate financial obligations. Administration is a cash-flow insolvency issue, whereas EBITDA is a profitability metric. Why Positive Adjusted EBITDA Does Not Prevent Administration EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation, and Amortisation) is often used to measure operational performance, but it ignores several critical factors that can cause a company to fail: Cash Flow Shortfalls: A company can be profitable on paper but have no cash in the bank to pay creditors, salaries, or tax debts. High Debt Servicing (Interest): Adjusted EBITDA adds back interest expenses, which masks the burden of debt repayments. If interest payments exceed operating cash flow, the company may fail. Capital Expenditure (CapEx): EBITDA ignores the cash spent on maintaining or upgrading machinery, property, or equipment. In asset-heavy industries, these costs can be substantial, making a \"positive EBITDA\" company cash-negative. Working Capital Requirements: A growing company might have high sales (positive EBITDA) but burn through cash by financing inventory or waiting for customers to pay invoices. Aggressive Adjustments: \"Adjusted\" EBITDA often adds back non-recurring costs. If these \"one-time\" costs become recurring, or if the adjustments are too aggressive, the true financial picture is much weaker than reported. Common Reasons for Insolvency with Positive EBITDA Refinancing Failure: A company may be able to pay interest but cannot repay a large balloon payment of debt principal when it matures. Creditor Pressure: If creditors (like HMRC or suppliers) are not paid on time, they can petition to wind up the company, forcing it into insolvency regardless of its EBITDA. Sudden Cash Shock: A loss of a major customer, rapid increase in raw material costs, or litigation costs can drain cash reserves, despite a healthy operational EBITDA. In summary, EBITDA is not a substitute for cash flow. A company with positive adjusted EBITDA is only safe if that profit successfully converts into cash to pay its debts.",

As it is a marketplace a lot less revenue will be generated per visit than companies like Next if the conversion rates are similar - maybe as low as 10% versus non-market place.  In other words you would expect a relatively high number of visits for such a model compared to those less structured that way. 3.  Unfortunately posters have banged on for years whenever these figures have looked good but they have proven hopelessly unreliable when it comes to being a forecaster of positive results.

Look at nastygal for instance - they have watched revenue on that \"brand\" fall from 140 million to about 15 million, with profit of 14 million turning to a loss of over 12 million and they don't know how to stop it...  Nastygal is even still paying the mortgage on a Kamani property! The reality is nastygal could be run from a bedroom. You see why next and the boohoo group can't be compared??",

All our Brands continue to trade profitably.\nWe are particularly pleased with the pace and scale of PLT's turnaround and the resulting material improvement in profitability. The Board had previously held the brand as an asset for sale. Given the success we are seeing with the turnaround, the momentum it is building and the substantial opportunity ahead as a fashion-led marketplace, the brand will be retained. As a result, PLT will be reported in the current year in Debenhams' continuing operations.\nDebenhams is exploring significant licensing opportunities and continues to advance the sale of non-core assets which would materially reduce the net debt in the next 12 months.\nThe Company will update the market in March 2026.\nNotes:\n[1]\nAdjusted EBITDA is calculated as loss before tax, interest, depreciation, amortisation, share-based payment charges and exceptional items.\n[2]\nPrevious guidance as at 27 November 2025 was approximately \u00a345m Adjusted EBITDA for total operations for FY26.\nEnquiries\nDebenhams Group\nPhil Ellis, Chief Financial Officer\nTel: +44 (0)161 233 2050\nZeus Capital - Nominated Advisor and Joint Broker\nDan Bate / James Edis\nTel: +44 (0)161 831 1512\nBenjamin Robertson\nTel: +44 (0)20 3829 5000\nPanmure Liberum - Joint Broker\nMark Dickenson / James Sinclair-Ford / Shalin Bhamra\nSodali & Co - Financial PR Adviser\nTel: +44 (0)20 3100 2000\nBen Foster / Louisa Henry\nTel: +44 (0)20 3984 0114\nAbout Debenhams Group\nDebenhams Group is an online platform, for fashion, home, and beauty, serving millions of customers across five shopping destinations: Debenhams, Karen Millen, boohoo, MAN and PLT. Debenhams Group dates back to 1778 when William Clark, a retail pioneer of the time, opened the UK's first department store. Today, the Group is home to Debenhams, Britain's online department store and leading fashion-led marketplaces, boohoo, PLT, MAN, and Karen Millen.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

It is also why I get so frustrated at people on here who in my view continually try to dress up bad news as good, often with very dodgy understanding and use of financials to do so which is particularly offensive to me given my own working background, experience and knowledge in that area. And the cynic in me, given their past announcements and performance, still believes this latest update is just an excuse to announce the end of the sale of PLT that never was or, even worse, the  typical, cheap AIM tactic of pumping a share price before a raise. HOWEVER, despite all appearances I don\u2019t like being negative so I have tried to think of a positive reason as to why they might have released an update so glowing of their performance but without giving any revenue figures at all (something I\u2019ve never seen before on any stock ever) and have come up with one! It could simply be that revenue IS ahead of  expectations but they have not given us any numbers as the revenue \u2018growth\u2019 is still negative and would detract from the positive message even though a fall in revenue is obviously no surprise. They could still have framed the numbers positively though if they had given any forecast of revenue in their outlook but as they didn\u2019t they have no expected numbers to reference against and simply thought it better to keep quiet. So I\u2019ll put away my cynic\u2019s hat for now and believe that they really are performing ahead of expectations and wait for the update in March to see what is really the case. In the meantime I\u2019ll try to take out my frustrations with the company much less on this board and on the people who post.  Can\u2019t promise but I\u2019ll try and then let the numbers do the talking when they do give them to us.",

The fact is youth brands were down 41 percent for h1 this year vs last year so with them saying there has been \"a discernible improvement in the performance of our Youth Brands\" doesn't really hold much weight with me, I believe h2 will still be over 30 percent down on last year which is still an absolute car crash.

Boohoo are taking out a lot of distributions capacity. SCB you were the biggest advocate for this as you wanted headcount down rapidly. However, there will be migration issues so Boo probably be happy to have another year lease to sort out transition.

US is a classic point of reference. It\u2019s never advisable to drive sales on a low to no profit basis like pure IT companies do. Especially when the clothing industry is so much about now and tomorrow. Dan has focused on creating an operating model that is proven by successful retailers. Also lowering debt, and putting the savings on loan interest into driving a trading platform strategy, thus lowering inventory significantly and putting the onus on third parties to manage much more of the inventory costs. So far, so good in preparing an operating model that can give great returns, now it\u2019s about sales and growth, which is significantly more attractive to manage, because it\u2019s positive behaviour as opposed to having constant distractions.

It is also why I get so frustrated at people on here who in my view continually try to dress up bad news as good, often with very dodgy understanding and use of financials to do so which is particularly offensive to me given my own working background, experience and knowledge in that area. And the cynic in me, given their past announcements and performance, still believes this latest update is just an excuse to announce the end of the sale of PLT that never was or, even worse, the  typical, cheap AIM tactic of pumping a share price before a raise. HOWEVER, despite all appearances I don\u2019t like being negative so I have tried to think of a positive reason as to why they might have released an update so glowing of their performance but without giving any revenue figures at all (something I\u2019ve never seen before on any stock ever) and have come up with one! It could simply be that revenue IS ahead of  expectations but they have not given us any numbers as the revenue \u2018growth\u2019 is still negative and would detract from the positive message even though a fall in revenue is obviously no surprise. They could still have framed the numbers positively though if they had given any forecast of revenue in their outlook but as they didn\u2019t they have no expected numbers to reference against and simply thought it better to keep quiet. So I\u2019ll put away my cynic\u2019s hat for now and believe that they really are performing ahead of expectations and wait for the update in March to see what is really the case. In the meantime I\u2019ll try to take out my frustrations with the company much less on this board and on the people who post.  Can\u2019t promise but I\u2019ll try and then let the numbers do the talking when they do give them to us.",

It is also why I get so frustrated at people on here who in my view continually try to dress up bad news as good, often with very dodgy understanding and use of financials to do so which is particularly offensive to me given my own working background, experience and knowledge in that area. And the cynic in me, given their past announcements and performance, still believes this latest update is just an excuse to announce the end of the sale of PLT that never was or, even worse, the  typical, cheap AIM tactic of pumping a share price before a raise. HOWEVER, despite all appearances I don\u2019t like being negative so I have tried to think of a positive reason as to why they might have released an update so glowing of their performance but without giving any revenue figures at all (something I\u2019ve never seen before on any stock ever) and have come up with one! It could simply be that revenue IS ahead of  expectations but they have not given us any numbers as the revenue \u2018growth\u2019 is still negative and would detract from the positive message even though a fall in revenue is obviously no surprise. They could still have framed the numbers positively though if they had given any forecast of revenue in their outlook but as they didn\u2019t they have no expected numbers to reference against and simply thought it better to keep quiet. So I\u2019ll put away my cynic\u2019s hat for now and believe that they really are performing ahead of expectations and wait for the update in March to see what is really the case. In the meantime I\u2019ll try to take out my frustrations with the company much less on this board and on the people who post.  Can\u2019t promise but I\u2019ll try and then let the numbers do the talking when they do give them to us.",

I also think Karen millen has taken a turn for the worst based on no mention of it in the trading update - remember how they were singing about it then all of a sudden forget to mention it. That suggests to me that the 31 percent decline seen in h1 has likely continued into h2. H1 loss would have been 50 million with without the 35 million one off boost, with further revenue decline I think h2 loss will be north of 50 million so the total loss for the year will be 65 plus million.... Unless they have already sold something and not updated the market? Based on that they will need to raise funds somehow..... And you have already suspected the same as me",

With my new positive hat on I don\u2019t think debt necessarily needs to be cleared.  As long as the debt is reasonable and manageable I think it is profit/cash generation and growth prospects that will be much more important.  Of course they could choose to use cash generation to clear all the debt but they might think it is an efficient use of capital to maintain some - like many other companies do. All this is academic though if they can\u2019t start generating profit at all and the numbers in March should give a good indication of progress towards that (or not).",

The question - is what is their interpretation of a discernible improvement? I notice they didn't mention the words flat line, leveled out or growth, so revenue is still falling. Youth brands decline for the full year will be in excess of 30 percent yoy which despite all the hype is a total car crash.

I'm now saying they will likely keep Burnley and instead do a cash raise in March. It's all a bit suspect this recent trading update. The fact is youth brands were down 41 percent for h1 this year vs last year so with them saying there has been \"a discernible improvement in the performance of our Youth Brands\" doesn't really hold much weight with me, I believe h2 will still be over 30 percent down on last year which is still an absolute car crash.

Boohoo are taking out a lot of distributions capacity. SCB you were the biggest advocate for this as you wanted headcount down rapidly. However, there will be migration issues so Boo probably be happy to have another year lease to sort out transition. Bfd is most likely correct that all staff related to Burnley who won\u2019t be retained are now at end of consultation period.",

Weaknesses have been largely dealt with under Dan\u2019s leadership, especially the eagerness of previous leadership to build out infrastructure before understand potential growth. US is a classic point of reference. It\u2019s never advisable to drive sales on a low to no profit basis like pure IT companies do. Especially when the clothing industry is so much about now and tomorrow. Dan has focused on creating an operating model that is proven by successful retailers. Also lowering debt, and putting the savings on loan interest into driving a trading platform strategy, thus lowering inventory significantly and putting the onus on third parties to manage much more of the inventory costs. So far, so good in preparing an operating model that can give great returns, now it\u2019s about sales and growth, which is significantly more attractive to manage, because it\u2019s positive behaviour as opposed to having constant distractions. Well done to long term holders for their patience. This story can only get better now most of the shackles are off!",

It is also why I get so frustrated at people on here who in my view continually try to dress up bad news as good, often with very dodgy understanding and use of financials to do so which is particularly offensive to me given my own working background, experience and knowledge in that area. And the cynic in me, given their past announcements and performance, still believes this latest update is just an excuse to announce the end of the sale of PLT that never was or, even worse, the  typical, cheap AIM tactic of pumping a share price before a raise. HOWEVER, despite all appearances I don\u2019t like being negative so I have tried to think of a positive reason as to why they might have released an update so glowing of their performance but without giving any revenue figures at all (something I\u2019ve never seen before on any stock ever) and have come up with one! It could simply be that revenue IS ahead of  expectations but they have not given us any numbers as the revenue \u2018growth\u2019 is still negative and would detract from the positive message even though a fall in revenue is obviously no surprise. They could still have framed the numbers positively though if they had given any forecast of revenue in their outlook but as they didn\u2019t they have no expected numbers to reference against and simply thought it better to keep quiet. So I\u2019ll put away my cynic\u2019s hat for now and believe that they really are performing ahead of expectations and wait for the update in March to see what is really the case. In the meantime I\u2019ll try to take out my frustrations with the company much less on this board and on the people who post.  Can\u2019t promise but I\u2019ll try and then let the numbers do the talking when they do give them to us.",

It is also why I get so frustrated at people on here who in my view continually try to dress up bad news as good, often with very dodgy understanding and use of financials to do so which is particularly offensive to me given my own working background, experience and knowledge in that area. And the cynic in me, given their past announcements and performance, still believes this latest update is just an excuse to announce the end of the sale of PLT that never was or, even worse, the  typical, cheap AIM tactic of pumping a share price before a raise. HOWEVER, despite all appearances I don\u2019t like being negative so I have tried to think of a positive reason as to why they might have released an update so glowing of their performance but without giving any revenue figures at all (something I\u2019ve never seen before on any stock ever) and have come up with one! It could simply be that revenue IS ahead of  expectations but they have not given us any numbers as the revenue \u2018growth\u2019 is still negative and would detract from the positive message even though a fall in revenue is obviously no surprise. They could still have framed the numbers positively though if they had given any forecast of revenue in their outlook but as they didn\u2019t they have no expected numbers to reference against and simply thought it better to keep quiet. So I\u2019ll put away my cynic\u2019s hat for now and believe that they really are performing ahead of expectations and wait for the update in March to see what is really the case. In the meantime I\u2019ll try to take out my frustrations with the company much less on this board and on the people who post.  Can\u2019t promise but I\u2019ll try and then let the numbers do the talking when they do give them to us.",

So we will soon see just how bad things really got with plt. As for the update - the board were sat there with all the numbers in from of them, all expect numbers of course as they year is not yet over.... So they have - gmv, revenue, ebitda and of course the dreaded loss.... Out of all of those they pick ebitda which straight away tells me that both gmv and revenue are smaller that expected, and the loss is bigger than expected..

I also think Karen millen has taken a turn for the worst based on no mention of it in the trading update - remember how they were singing about it then all of a sudden forget to mention it. That suggests to me that the 31 percent decline seen in h1 has likely continued into h2. H1 loss would have been 50 million with without the 35 million one off boost, with further revenue decline I think h2 loss will be north of 50 million so the total loss for the year will be 65 plus million.... Unless they have already sold something and not updated the market? Based on that they will need to raise funds somehow..... And you have already suspected the same as me",

With my new positive hat on I don\u2019t think debt necessarily needs to be cleared.  As long as the debt is reasonable and manageable I think it is profit/cash generation and growth prospects that will be much more important.  Of course they could choose to use cash generation to clear all the debt but they might think it is an efficient use of capital to maintain some - like many other companies do. All this is academic though if they can\u2019t start generating profit at all and the numbers in March should give a good indication of progress towards that (or not).",

The question - is what is their interpretation of a discernible improvement? I notice they didn't mention the words flat line, leveled out or growth, so revenue is still falling. Youth brands decline for the full year will be in excess of 30 percent yoy which despite all the hype is a total car crash.

I'm now saying they will likely keep Burnley and instead do a cash raise in March. It's all a bit suspect this recent trading update. The fact is youth brands were down 41 percent for h1 this year vs last year so with them saying there has been \"a discernible improvement in the performance of our Youth Brands\" doesn't really hold much weight with me, I believe h2 will still be over 30 percent down on last year which is still an absolute car crash.

Boohoo are taking out a lot of distributions capacity. SCB you were the biggest advocate for this as you wanted headcount down rapidly. However, there will be migration issues so Boo probably be happy to have another year lease to sort out transition. Bfd is most likely correct that all staff related to Burnley who won\u2019t be retained are now at end of consultation period.",

Weaknesses have been largely dealt with under Dan\u2019s leadership, especially the eagerness of previous leadership to build out infrastructure before understand potential growth. US is a classic point of reference. It\u2019s never advisable to drive sales on a low to no profit basis like pure IT companies do. Especially when the clothing industry is so much about now and tomorrow. Dan has focused on creating an operating model that is proven by successful retailers. Also lowering debt, and putting the savings on loan interest into driving a trading platform strategy, thus lowering inventory significantly and putting the onus on third parties to manage much more of the inventory costs. So far, so good in preparing an operating model that can give great returns, now it\u2019s about sales and growth, which is significantly more attractive to manage, because it\u2019s positive behaviour as opposed to having constant distractions. Well done to long term holders for their patience. This story can only get better now most of the shackles are off!",

It is also why I get so frustrated at people on here who in my view continually try to dress up bad news as good, often with very dodgy understanding and use of financials to do so which is particularly offensive to me given my own working background, experience and knowledge in that area. And the cynic in me, given their past announcements and performance, still believes this latest update is just an excuse to announce the end of the sale of PLT that never was or, even worse, the  typical, cheap AIM tactic of pumping a share price before a raise. HOWEVER, despite all appearances I don\u2019t like being negative so I have tried to think of a positive reason as to why they might have released an update so glowing of their performance but without giving any revenue figures at all (something I\u2019ve never seen before on any stock ever) and have come up with one! It could simply be that revenue IS ahead of  expectations but they have not given us any numbers as the revenue \u2018growth\u2019 is still negative and would detract from the positive message even though a fall in revenue is obviously no surprise. They could still have framed the numbers positively though if they had given any forecast of revenue in their outlook but as they didn\u2019t they have no expected numbers to reference against and simply thought it better to keep quiet. So I\u2019ll put away my cynic\u2019s hat for now and believe that they really are performing ahead of expectations and wait for the update in March to see what is really the case. In the meantime I\u2019ll try to take out my frustrations with the company much less on this board and on the people who post.  Can\u2019t promise but I\u2019ll try and then let the numbers do the talking when they do give them to us.",

It is also why I get so frustrated at people on here who in my view continually try to dress up bad news as good, often with very dodgy understanding and use of financials to do so which is particularly offensive to me given my own working background, experience and knowledge in that area. And the cynic in me, given their past announcements and performance, still believes this latest update is just an excuse to announce the end of the sale of PLT that never was or, even worse, the  typical, cheap AIM tactic of pumping a share price before a raise. HOWEVER, despite all appearances I don\u2019t like being negative so I have tried to think of a positive reason as to why they might have released an update so glowing of their performance but without giving any revenue figures at all (something I\u2019ve never seen before on any stock ever) and have come up with one! It could simply be that revenue IS ahead of  expectations but they have not given us any numbers as the revenue \u2018growth\u2019 is still negative and would detract from the positive message even though a fall in revenue is obviously no surprise. They could still have framed the numbers positively though if they had given any forecast of revenue in their outlook but as they didn\u2019t they have no expected numbers to reference against and simply thought it better to keep quiet. So I\u2019ll put away my cynic\u2019s hat for now and believe that they really are performing ahead of expectations and wait for the update in March to see what is really the case. In the meantime I\u2019ll try to take out my frustrations with the company much less on this board and on the people who post.  Can\u2019t promise but I\u2019ll try and then let the numbers do the talking when they do give them to us.",

There are strict rules on holding an asset for sale and these rules have to be followed. Nobody seemed to want to believe me when I said plt wouldn't be sold. So we will soon see just how bad things really got with plt. As for the update - the board were sat there with all the numbers in from of them, all expect numbers of course as they year is not yet over.... So they have - gmv, revenue, ebitda and of course the dreaded loss.... Out of all of those they pick ebitda which straight away tells me that both gmv and revenue are smaller that expected, and the loss is bigger than expected..

The company said it now expects adjusted EBITDA for total operations of \u00a350 million for the year to Feb. 28, 2026, up from previous guidance of about \u00a345 million issued in November. The upgrade reflects continued momentum at the Debenhams brand, improved performance at its youth-focused labels and progress on its transformation plan, the company said in a trading update. \u201cAll our brands continue to trade profitably,\u201d Debenhams Group said. The company highlighted a material improvement in profitability at PrettyLittleThing (PLT), which had previously been held as an asset for sale. Given the turnaround and current trading performance, the brand will now be retained and reported within continuing operations for the current financial year. \u201cWe are particularly pleased with the pace and scale of PLT\u2019s turnaround and the resulting material improvement in profitability,\u201d the company said. Debenhams Group added that it is exploring significant licensing opportunities and continues to advance the sale of non-core assets, which it said would materially reduce net debt over the next 12 months.",

I also think Karen millen has taken a turn for the worst based on no mention of it in the trading update - remember how they were singing about it then all of a sudden forget to mention it. That suggests to me that the 31 percent decline seen in h1 has likely continued into h2. H1 loss would have been 50 million with without the 35 million one off boost, with further revenue decline I think h2 loss will be north of 50 million so the total loss for the year will be 65 plus million.... Unless they have already sold something and not updated the market? Based on that they will need to raise funds somehow..... And you have already suspected the same as me",

With my new positive hat on I don\u2019t think debt necessarily needs to be cleared.  As long as the debt is reasonable and manageable I think it is profit/cash generation and growth prospects that will be much more important.  Of course they could choose to use cash generation to clear all the debt but they might think it is an efficient use of capital to maintain some - like many other companies do. All this is academic though if they can\u2019t start generating profit at all and the numbers in March should give a good indication of progress towards that (or not).",

I bet you can't find me another clothing retailer that has seen that kind on revenue decline for h1 in a yoy comparative ever. The question - is what is their interpretation of a discernible improvement? I notice they didn't mention the words flat line, leveled out or growth, so revenue is still falling. Youth brands decline for the full year will be in excess of 30 percent yoy which despite all the hype is a total car crash.

I'm now saying they will likely keep Burnley and instead do a cash raise in March. It's all a bit suspect this recent trading update. The fact is youth brands were down 41 percent for h1 this year vs last year so with them saying there has been \"a discernible improvement in the performance of our Youth Brands\" doesn't really hold much weight with me, I believe h2 will still be over 30 percent down on last year which is still an absolute car crash.

Boohoo are taking out a lot of distributions capacity. SCB you were the biggest advocate for this as you wanted headcount down rapidly. However, there will be migration issues so Boo probably be happy to have another year lease to sort out transition. Bfd is most likely correct that all staff related to Burnley who won\u2019t be retained are now at end of consultation period.",

Weaknesses have been largely dealt with under Dan\u2019s leadership, especially the eagerness of previous leadership to build out infrastructure before understand potential growth. US is a classic point of reference. It\u2019s never advisable to drive sales on a low to no profit basis like pure IT companies do. Especially when the clothing industry is so much about now and tomorrow. Dan has focused on creating an operating model that is proven by successful retailers. Also lowering debt, and putting the savings on loan interest into driving a trading platform strategy, thus lowering inventory significantly and putting the onus on third parties to manage much more of the inventory costs. So far, so good in preparing an operating model that can give great returns, now it\u2019s about sales and growth, which is significantly more attractive to manage, because it\u2019s positive behaviour as opposed to having constant distractions. Well done to long term holders for their patience. This story can only get better now most of the shackles are off!",

It is also why I get so frustrated at people on here who in my view continually try to dress up bad news as good, often with very dodgy understanding and use of financials to do so which is particularly offensive to me given my own working background, experience and knowledge in that area. And the cynic in me, given their past announcements and performance, still believes this latest update is just an excuse to announce the end of the sale of PLT that never was or, even worse, the  typical, cheap AIM tactic of pumping a share price before a raise. HOWEVER, despite all appearances I don\u2019t like being negative so I have tried to think of a positive reason as to why they might have released an update so glowing of their performance but without giving any revenue figures at all (something I\u2019ve never seen before on any stock ever) and have come up with one! It could simply be that revenue IS ahead of  expectations but they have not given us any numbers as the revenue \u2018growth\u2019 is still negative and would detract from the positive message even though a fall in revenue is obviously no surprise. They could still have framed the numbers positively though if they had given any forecast of revenue in their outlook but as they didn\u2019t they have no expected numbers to reference against and simply thought it better to keep quiet. So I\u2019ll put away my cynic\u2019s hat for now and believe that they really are performing ahead of expectations and wait for the update in March to see what is really the case. In the meantime I\u2019ll try to take out my frustrations with the company much less on this board and on the people who post.  Can\u2019t promise but I\u2019ll try and then let the numbers do the talking when they do give them to us.",

It is also why I get so frustrated at people on here who in my view continually try to dress up bad news as good, often with very dodgy understanding and use of financials to do so which is particularly offensive to me given my own working background, experience and knowledge in that area. And the cynic in me, given their past announcements and performance, still believes this latest update is just an excuse to announce the end of the sale of PLT that never was or, even worse, the  typical, cheap AIM tactic of pumping a share price before a raise. HOWEVER, despite all appearances I don\u2019t like being negative so I have tried to think of a positive reason as to why they might have released an update so glowing of their performance but without giving any revenue figures at all (something I\u2019ve never seen before on any stock ever) and have come up with one! It could simply be that revenue IS ahead of  expectations but they have not given us any numbers as the revenue \u2018growth\u2019 is still negative and would detract from the positive message even though a fall in revenue is obviously no surprise. They could still have framed the numbers positively though if they had given any forecast of revenue in their outlook but as they didn\u2019t they have no expected numbers to reference against and simply thought it better to keep quiet. So I\u2019ll put away my cynic\u2019s hat for now and believe that they really are performing ahead of expectations and wait for the update in March to see what is really the case. In the meantime I\u2019ll try to take out my frustrations with the company much less on this board and on the people who post.  Can\u2019t promise but I\u2019ll try and then let the numbers do the talking when they do give them to us.",

There are strict rules on holding an asset for sale and these rules have to be followed. Nobody seemed to want to believe me when I said plt wouldn't be sold. So we will soon see just how bad things really got with plt. As for the update - the board were sat there with all the numbers in from of them, all expect numbers of course as they year is not yet over.... So they have - gmv, revenue, ebitda and of course the dreaded loss.... Out of all of those they pick ebitda which straight away tells me that both gmv and revenue are smaller that expected, and the loss is bigger than expected..

          "content": "For anyone in doubt of the process \ud83d\udc4c... Filing a case in the High Court of England and Wales initiates formal, complex, and often costly litigation, typically reserved for high-value (generally over \u00a3100,000) or high-importance legal disputes. Once you file a claim, the court processes the documents, and the case enters a strictly managed procedural timetable. Here is what happens in detail when you file at the High Court: 1. Issuing and Sealing the Claim Case Number and \"Sealing\": After you submit the Claim Form and Particulars of Claim (either by paper or through the CE-File system), the court reviews it and \"seals\" (stamps) it, issuing a unique case number. Service on the Defendant: Once sealed, the court generally returns the documents to you. It is your responsibility (not the court's) to serve these documents on the defendant, usually within four months, or six months if serving outside England and Wales. Public Record: The High Court operates under \"open justice.\" Once proceedings are served, the case becomes a public record, meaning third parties or the press can request to see documents like the claim form and defense. 2. The Initial Response Acknowledgement of Service: The defendant has 14 days to file an Acknowledgement of Service, stating whether they intend to defend the claim. Defense and Counterclaim: If defending, the defendant must file a detailed \"Defense\" (and any counterclaim) within 28 days of service of the particulars. Default Judgment: If the defendant fails to file an acknowledgement or a defense within the strict time limits, you can ask the court to enter a \"judgment in default,\" meaning you win without a full trial. 3. Case Management Court Directions: Once a defense is filed, the court will issue a timetable (directions) for the case, setting out deadlines for each stage leading to trial. Case Management Conference (CMC): For complex cases, a judge will hold a CMC to discuss how the claim should proceed, set timetables, and approve costs budgets. 4. Evidence and Disclosure Disclosure of Documents: Both sides are required to disclose to each other all relevant documents in their possession, including electronic information, that support or undermine their case. Witness Statements: Parties will prepare and exchange written statements from witnesses of fact. Expert Evidence: If technical evidence is required, you must get the court's permission to use an expert witness, who has an overriding duty to the court to be independent. 5. Trial and Judgment Pre-Trial Review: A judge will check that the case is ready for trial. Trial: The case will be heard by a High Court judge (rarely a jury) in a formal, public hearing. Judgment: A decision may be given immediately, but often it is \"reserved,\" meaning the judge will give their written decision weeks or months later. 6. Costs Loser Pays Rule: The High Court usually operates on a \"loser pays\" basis. The losing party is typically ordered to pay a l",

The company said it now expects adjusted EBITDA for total operations of \u00a350 million for the year to Feb. 28, 2026, up from previous guidance of about \u00a345 million issued in November. The upgrade reflects continued momentum at the Debenhams brand, improved performance at its youth-focused labels and progress on its transformation plan, the company said in a trading update. \u201cAll our brands continue to trade profitably,\u201d Debenhams Group said. The company highlighted a material improvement in profitability at PrettyLittleThing (PLT), which had previously been held as an asset for sale. Given the turnaround and current trading performance, the brand will now be retained and reported within continuing operations for the current financial year. \u201cWe are particularly pleased with the pace and scale of PLT\u2019s turnaround and the resulting material improvement in profitability,\u201d the company said. Debenhams Group added that it is exploring significant licensing opportunities and continues to advance the sale of non-core assets, which it said would materially reduce net debt over the next 12 months.",

I also think Karen millen has taken a turn for the worst based on no mention of it in the trading update - remember how they were singing about it then all of a sudden forget to mention it. That suggests to me that the 31 percent decline seen in h1 has likely continued into h2. H1 loss would have been 50 million with without the 35 million one off boost, with further revenue decline I think h2 loss will be north of 50 million so the total loss for the year will be 65 plus million.... Unless they have already sold something and not updated the market? Based on that they will need to raise funds somehow..... And you have already suspected the same as me",

With my new positive hat on I don\u2019t think debt necessarily needs to be cleared.  As long as the debt is reasonable and manageable I think it is profit/cash generation and growth prospects that will be much more important.  Of course they could choose to use cash generation to clear all the debt but they might think it is an efficient use of capital to maintain some - like many other companies do. All this is academic though if they can\u2019t start generating profit at all and the numbers in March should give a good indication of progress towards that (or not).",

This is a result of the continued momentum in our Debenhams brand, a discernible improvement in the performance of our Youth Brands and accelerated progress on our transformation plan.

I bet you can't find me another clothing retailer that has seen that kind on revenue decline for h1 in a yoy comparative ever. The question - is what is their interpretation of a discernible improvement? I notice they didn't mention the words flat line, leveled out or growth, so revenue is still falling. Youth brands decline for the full year will be in excess of 30 percent yoy which despite all the hype is a total car crash. Imagine if February takes turn for the worst and they can't hit the adjusted ebitda?",

The fact is youth brands were down 41 percent for h1 this year vs last year so with them saying there has been \"a discernible improvement in the performance of our Youth Brands\" doesn't really hold much weight with me, I believe h2 will still be over 30 percent down on last year which is still an absolute car crash.

Boohoo are taking out a lot of distributions capacity. SCB you were the biggest advocate for this as you wanted headcount down rapidly. However, there will be migration issues so Boo probably be happy to have another year lease to sort out transition.

US is a classic point of reference. It\u2019s never advisable to drive sales on a low to no profit basis like pure IT companies do. Especially when the clothing industry is so much about now and tomorrow. Dan has focused on creating an operating model that is proven by successful retailers. Also lowering debt, and putting the savings on loan interest into driving a trading platform strategy, thus lowering inventory significantly and putting the onus on third parties to manage much more of the inventory costs. So far, so good in preparing an operating model that can give great returns, now it\u2019s about sales and growth, which is significantly more attractive to manage, because it\u2019s positive behaviour as opposed to having constant distractions.

It is also why I get so frustrated at people on here who in my view continually try to dress up bad news as good, often with very dodgy understanding and use of financials to do so which is particularly offensive to me given my own working background, experience and knowledge in that area. And the cynic in me, given their past announcements and performance, still believes this latest update is just an excuse to announce the end of the sale of PLT that never was or, even worse, the  typical, cheap AIM tactic of pumping a share price before a raise. HOWEVER, despite all appearances I don\u2019t like being negative so I have tried to think of a positive reason as to why they might have released an update so glowing of their performance but without giving any revenue figures at all (something I\u2019ve never seen before on any stock ever) and have come up with one! It could simply be that revenue IS ahead of  expectations but they have not given us any numbers as the revenue \u2018growth\u2019 is still negative and would detract from the positive message even though a fall in revenue is obviously no surprise. They could still have framed the numbers positively though if they had given any forecast of revenue in their outlook but as they didn\u2019t they have no expected numbers to reference against and simply thought it better to keep quiet. So I\u2019ll put away my cynic\u2019s hat for now and believe that they really are performing ahead of expectations and wait for the update in March to see what is really the case. In the meantime I\u2019ll try to take out my frustrations with the company much less on this board and on the people who post.  Can\u2019t promise but I\u2019ll try and then let the numbers do the talking when they do give them to us.",

It is also why I get so frustrated at people on here who in my view continually try to dress up bad news as good, often with very dodgy understanding and use of financials to do so which is particularly offensive to me given my own working background, experience and knowledge in that area. And the cynic in me, given their past announcements and performance, still believes this latest update is just an excuse to announce the end of the sale of PLT that never was or, even worse, the  typical, cheap AIM tactic of pumping a share price before a raise. HOWEVER, despite all appearances I don\u2019t like being negative so I have tried to think of a positive reason as to why they might have released an update so glowing of their performance but without giving any revenue figures at all (something I\u2019ve never seen before on any stock ever) and have come up with one! It could simply be that revenue IS ahead of  expectations but they have not given us any numbers as the revenue \u2018growth\u2019 is still negative and would detract from the positive message even though a fall in revenue is obviously no surprise. They could still have framed the numbers positively though if they had given any forecast of revenue in their outlook but as they didn\u2019t they have no expected numbers to reference against and simply thought it better to keep quiet. So I\u2019ll put away my cynic\u2019s hat for now and believe that they really are performing ahead of expectations and wait for the update in March to see what is really the case. In the meantime I\u2019ll try to take out my frustrations with the company much less on this board and on the people who post.  Can\u2019t promise but I\u2019ll try and then let the numbers do the talking when they do give them to us.",

          "content": "For anyone in doubt of the process \ud83d\udc4c... Filing a case in the High Court of England and Wales initiates formal, complex, and often costly litigation, typically reserved for high-value (generally over \u00a3100,000) or high-importance legal disputes. Once you file a claim, the court processes the documents, and the case enters a strictly managed procedural timetable. Here is what happens in detail when you file at the High Court: 1. Issuing and Sealing the Claim Case Number and \"Sealing\": After you submit the Claim Form and Particulars of Claim (either by paper or through the CE-File system), the court reviews it and \"seals\" (stamps) it, issuing a unique case number. Service on the Defendant: Once sealed, the court generally returns the documents to you. It is your responsibility (not the court's) to serve these documents on the defendant, usually within four months, or six months if serving outside England and Wales. Public Record: The High Court operates under \"open justice.\" Once proceedings are served, the case becomes a public record, meaning third parties or the press can request to see documents like the claim form and defense. 2. The Initial Response Acknowledgement of Service: The defendant has 14 days to file an Acknowledgement of Service, stating whether they intend to defend the claim. Defense and Counterclaim: If defending, the defendant must file a detailed \"Defense\" (and any counterclaim) within 28 days of service of the particulars. Default Judgment: If the defendant fails to file an acknowledgement or a defense within the strict time limits, you can ask the court to enter a \"judgment in default,\" meaning you win without a full trial. 3. Case Management Court Directions: Once a defense is filed, the court will issue a timetable (directions) for the case, setting out deadlines for each stage leading to trial. Case Management Conference (CMC): For complex cases, a judge will hold a CMC to discuss how the claim should proceed, set timetables, and approve costs budgets. 4. Evidence and Disclosure Disclosure of Documents: Both sides are required to disclose to each other all relevant documents in their possession, including electronic information, that support or undermine their case. Witness Statements: Parties will prepare and exchange written statements from witnesses of fact. Expert Evidence: If technical evidence is required, you must get the court's permission to use an expert witness, who has an overriding duty to the court to be independent. 5. Trial and Judgment Pre-Trial Review: A judge will check that the case is ready for trial. Trial: The case will be heard by a High Court judge (rarely a jury) in a formal, public hearing. Judgment: A decision may be given immediately, but often it is \"reserved,\" meaning the judge will give their written decision weeks or months later. 6. Costs Loser Pays Rule: The High Court usually operates on a \"loser pays\" basis. The losing party is typically ordered to pay a l",

          "content": "For anyone in doubt of the process \ud83d\udc4c... Filing a case in the High Court of England and Wales initiates formal, complex, and often costly litigation, typically reserved for high-value (generally over \u00a3100,000) or high-importance legal disputes. Once you file a claim, the court processes the documents, and the case enters a strictly managed procedural timetable. Here is what happens in detail when you file at the High Court: 1. Issuing and Sealing the Claim Case Number and \"Sealing\": After you submit the Claim Form and Particulars of Claim (either by paper or through the CE-File system), the court reviews it and \"seals\" (stamps) it, issuing a unique case number. Service on the Defendant: Once sealed, the court generally returns the documents to you. It is your responsibility (not the court's) to serve these documents on the defendant, usually within four months, or six months if serving outside England and Wales. Public Record: The High Court operates under \"open justice.\" Once proceedings are served, the case becomes a public record, meaning third parties or the press can request to see documents like the claim form and defense. 2. The Initial Response Acknowledgement of Service: The defendant has 14 days to file an Acknowledgement of Service, stating whether they intend to defend the claim. Defense and Counterclaim: If defending, the defendant must file a detailed \"Defense\" (and any counterclaim) within 28 days of service of the particulars. Default Judgment: If the defendant fails to file an acknowledgement or a defense within the strict time limits, you can ask the court to enter a \"judgment in default,\" meaning you win without a full trial. 3. Case Management Court Directions: Once a defense is filed, the court will issue a timetable (directions) for the case, setting out deadlines for each stage leading to trial. Case Management Conference (CMC): For complex cases, a judge will hold a CMC to discuss how the claim should proceed, set timetables, and approve costs budgets. 4. Evidence and Disclosure Disclosure of Documents: Both sides are required to disclose to each other all relevant documents in their possession, including electronic information, that support or undermine their case. Witness Statements: Parties will prepare and exchange written statements from witnesses of fact. Expert Evidence: If technical evidence is required, you must get the court's permission to use an expert witness, who has an overriding duty to the court to be independent. 5. Trial and Judgment Pre-Trial Review: A judge will check that the case is ready for trial. Trial: The case will be heard by a High Court judge (rarely a jury) in a formal, public hearing. Judgment: A decision may be given immediately, but often it is \"reserved,\" meaning the judge will give their written decision weeks or months later. 6. Costs Loser Pays Rule: The High Court usually operates on a \"loser pays\" basis. The losing party is typically ordered to pay a l",

The company said it now expects adjusted EBITDA for total operations of \u00a350 million for the year to Feb. 28, 2026, up from previous guidance of about \u00a345 million issued in November. The upgrade reflects continued momentum at the Debenhams brand, improved performance at its youth-focused labels and progress on its transformation plan, the company said in a trading update. \u201cAll our brands continue to trade profitably,\u201d Debenhams Group said. The company highlighted a material improvement in profitability at PrettyLittleThing (PLT), which had previously been held as an asset for sale. Given the turnaround and current trading performance, the brand will now be retained and reported within continuing operations for the current financial year. \u201cWe are particularly pleased with the pace and scale of PLT\u2019s turnaround and the resulting material improvement in profitability,\u201d the company said. Debenhams Group added that it is exploring significant licensing opportunities and continues to advance the sale of non-core assets, which it said would materially reduce net debt over the next 12 months.",

I also think Karen millen has taken a turn for the worst based on no mention of it in the trading update - remember how they were singing about it then all of a sudden forget to mention it. That suggests to me that the 31 percent decline seen in h1 has likely continued into h2. H1 loss would have been 50 million with without the 35 million one off boost, with further revenue decline I think h2 loss will be north of 50 million so the total loss for the year will be 65 plus million.... Unless they have already sold something and not updated the market? Based on that they will need to raise funds somehow..... And you have already suspected the same as me",

With my new positive hat on I don\u2019t think debt necessarily needs to be cleared.  As long as the debt is reasonable and manageable I think it is profit/cash generation and growth prospects that will be much more important.  Of course they could choose to use cash generation to clear all the debt but they might think it is an efficient use of capital to maintain some - like many other companies do. All this is academic though if they can\u2019t start generating profit at all and the numbers in March should give a good indication of progress towards that (or not).",

This is a result of the continued momentum in our Debenhams brand, a discernible improvement in the performance of our Youth Brands and accelerated progress on our transformation plan. All our Brands continue to trade profitably. Equally sad that you wont answer the question that buffaloben asked you. Then again, he was just the latest in a long line",

I bet you can't find me another clothing retailer that has seen that kind on revenue decline for h1 in a yoy comparative ever. The question - is what is their interpretation of a discernible improvement? I notice they didn't mention the words flat line, leveled out or growth, so revenue is still falling. Youth brands decline for the full year will be in excess of 30 percent yoy which despite all the hype is a total car crash. Imagine if February takes turn for the worst and they can't hit the adjusted ebitda?",

And with youth brands dying and market place providing more of the revenue the adjusted ebitda margin will never return to 10 percent levels.

I'm now saying they will likely keep Burnley and instead do a cash raise in March. It's all a bit suspect this recent trading update. The fact is youth brands were down 41 percent for h1 this year vs last year so with them saying there has been \"a discernible improvement in the performance of our Youth Brands\" doesn't really hold much weight with me, I believe h2 will still be over 30 percent down on last year which is still an absolute car crash. There is going to be at least a drop of 300 million in revenue for the year.",

Boohoo are taking out a lot of distributions capacity. SCB you were the biggest advocate for this as you wanted headcount down rapidly. However, there will be migration issues so Boo probably be happy to have another year lease to sort out transition. Bfd is most likely correct that all staff related to Burnley who won\u2019t be retained are now at end of consultation period.",

US is a classic point of reference. It\u2019s never advisable to drive sales on a low to no profit basis like pure IT companies do. Especially when the clothing industry is so much about now and tomorrow. Dan has focused on creating an operating model that is proven by successful retailers. Also lowering debt, and putting the savings on loan interest into driving a trading platform strategy, thus lowering inventory significantly and putting the onus on third parties to manage much more of the inventory costs. So far, so good in preparing an operating model that can give great returns, now it\u2019s about sales and growth, which is significantly more attractive to manage, because it\u2019s positive behaviour as opposed to having constant distractions.

This all means they are going to need a cash influx and that's what is coming in March.... \"we have achieved this but in return we need xy and z to continue or the company will run out kf cash\" And the fools here will once again applaud it!!

It is also why I get so frustrated at people on here who in my view continually try to dress up bad news as good, often with very dodgy understanding and use of financials to do so which is particularly offensive to me given my own working background, experience and knowledge in that area. And the cynic in me, given their past announcements and performance, still believes this latest update is just an excuse to announce the end of the sale of PLT that never was or, even worse, the  typical, cheap AIM tactic of pumping a share price before a raise. HOWEVER, despite all appearances I don\u2019t like being negative so I have tried to think of a positive reason as to why they might have released an update so glowing of their performance but without giving any revenue figures at all (something I\u2019ve never seen before on any stock ever) and have come up with one! It could simply be that revenue IS ahead of  expectations but they have not given us any numbers as the revenue \u2018growth\u2019 is still negative and would detract from the positive message even though a fall in revenue is obviously no surprise. They could still have framed the numbers positively though if they had given any forecast of revenue in their outlook but as they didn\u2019t they have no expected numbers to reference against and simply thought it better to keep quiet. So I\u2019ll put away my cynic\u2019s hat for now and believe that they really are performing ahead of expectations and wait for the update in March to see what is really the case. In the meantime I\u2019ll try to take out my frustrations with the company much less on this board and on the people who post.  Can\u2019t promise but I\u2019ll try and then let the numbers do the talking when they do give them to us.",

It is also why I get so frustrated at people on here who in my view continually try to dress up bad news as good, often with very dodgy understanding and use of financials to do so which is particularly offensive to me given my own working background, experience and knowledge in that area. And the cynic in me, given their past announcements and performance, still believes this latest update is just an excuse to announce the end of the sale of PLT that never was or, even worse, the  typical, cheap AIM tactic of pumping a share price before a raise. HOWEVER, despite all appearances I don\u2019t like being negative so I have tried to think of a positive reason as to why they might have released an update so glowing of their performance but without giving any revenue figures at all (something I\u2019ve never seen before on any stock ever) and have come up with one! It could simply be that revenue IS ahead of  expectations but they have not given us any numbers as the revenue \u2018growth\u2019 is still negative and would detract from the positive message even though a fall in revenue is obviously no surprise. They could still have framed the numbers positively though if they had given any forecast of revenue in their outlook but as they didn\u2019t they have no expected numbers to reference against and simply thought it better to keep quiet. So I\u2019ll put away my cynic\u2019s hat for now and believe that they really are performing ahead of expectations and wait for the update in March to see what is really the case. In the meantime I\u2019ll try to take out my frustrations with the company much less on this board and on the people who post.  Can\u2019t promise but I\u2019ll try and then let the numbers do the talking when they do give them to us.",
