All our Brands continue to trade profitably.\nWe are particularly pleased with the pace and scale of PLT's turnaround and the resulting material improvement in profitability. The Board had previously held the brand as an asset for sale. Given the success we are seeing with the turnaround, the momentum it is building and the substantial opportunity ahead as a fashion-led marketplace, the brand will be retained. As a result, PLT will be reported in the current year in Debenhams' continuing operations.\nDebenhams is exploring significant licensing opportunities and continues to advance the sale of non-core assets which would materially reduce the net debt in the next 12 months.\nThe Company will update the market in March 2026.\nNotes:\n[1]\nAdjusted EBITDA is calculated as loss before tax, interest, depreciation, amortisation, share-based payment charges and exceptional items.\n[2]\nPrevious guidance as at 27 November 2025 was approximately \u00a345m Adjusted EBITDA for total operations for FY26.\nEnquiries\nDebenhams Group\nPhil Ellis, Chief Financial Officer\nTel: +44 (0)161 233 2050\nZeus Capital - Nominated Advisor and Joint Broker\nDan Bate / James Edis\nTel: +44 (0)161 831 1512\nBenjamin Robertson\nTel: +44 (0)20 3829 5000\nPanmure Liberum - Joint Broker\nMark Dickenson / James Sinclair-Ford / Shalin Bhamra\nSodali & Co - Financial PR Adviser\nTel: +44 (0)20 3100 2000\nBen Foster / Louisa Henry\nTel: +44 (0)20 3984 0114\nAbout Debenhams Group\nDebenhams Group is an online platform, for fashion, home, and beauty, serving millions of customers across five shopping destinations: Debenhams, Karen Millen, boohoo, MAN and PLT.
