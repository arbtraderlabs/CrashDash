This achievement is a result of our strategic initiatives.\n\u25cf\nOperating EBITDA Loss\nOperating EBITDA loss improved to \u00a31.9 million (2023: \u00a32.2 million). This positive trend stems from enhanced cost controls and operational efficiencies throughout the year. We anticipate these gains to continue into Q1 and Q2 of 2025, aided by further process automation. Our target is to reduce G&A and fixed costs by 20% by the close of 2025.*\nKey Strategic Initiatives and Operational Highlights\n1.\nTreat\u2010It Clinic\n\u25cf\nStrategic Partnerships\n56.1% growth in Q1 2025 of the Clinic's patient base with strong growth over 2024, supported by new partnerships with patient\u2010focused organisations. These collaborations support expansion of the Clinic's services.\n\u25cf\nMarket Demand and Revenue Expansion\nMonthly revenue rose significantly from \u00a315,192 in January 2024 to \u00a376,842 in January 2025 - a 406% rise. Demand for both consultations and medication sales continues to increase.\n\u25cf\nCost Reduction Measures\nGeneral & Administrative (G&A) and fixed costs declined from an average of \u00a391,449 per month in 2024 to \u00a378,963 in January 2025, marking a 14% reduction. These savings stemmed from streamlined administrative processes, improved IT management, and ongoing automation efforts.\n2. AgriTec Ltd. (Subsidiary Growth)\n\u25cf\nSpanish Consultation Project\nA key driver of revenue growth in 2024 was the development of a cannabis cultivation facility in Spain, by our subsidiary. This initiative generated \u00a3226,000 in revenue, and the Company aims to realise an additional \u00a31 million in 2025 through consulting services. This collaboration also helps reinforce the Company's supply chain by providing reliable access to high\u2010demand medicinal cannabis APIs for the UK and European markets.\n3. GP Service - AI Integration\n\u25cf\nAI Enhancing Doctors\nThe GP Service AI\u2010driven system\n\"DocNow\"\ncaptures and pre\u2010organises patient information before a consultation, providing comprehensive case notes that may accelerate clinical decisions. By integrating data analysis and automation, a doctor can increase consultation capacity from 3 to up to 20 sessions per hour.\n\u25cf\nStrategic B2B Integration\nKanabo Group is in ongoing discussions with a strategic partner for B2B integration of its AI\u2010powered triage system, intended to support the Company's broader telehealth ecosystem and address growing demand for efficient patient care solutions.\n\u25cf\nAI\u2010Driven Growth & Unit Economics\nPriced at \u00a329 per consultation, the AI\u2010powered model generates an estimated 33% gross profit per consultation while increasing scalability. Less than 10% of AI\u2010triaged cases have so far been rejected by doctors, reflecting the system's reliability in clinical decision\u2010making.\nOutlook\nIn the coming quarters, Kanabo plans to diversify the Treat\u2010It Clinic's product offerings and explore ways to improve profit margins from cannabis medication sales. The Company also plans to\nhost a webinar in the upcoming month\nto demonstrate its AI triage system, which has already shown encouraging results.\nThe core focus is on executing strategic projects and refining operational efficiency. These efforts are expected to foster sustainable growth and underscore the potential of AI\u2010driven technologies to further enhance services and create additional revenue streams.\nThe Company continues to review its strategic direction and assess the need for additional resources to develop commercial AI technology. Therefore, the Company continues to evaluate its capital needs and alternatives to fund its capital requirements to ensure that it has\nthe appropriate pathway to fund its principal divisions towards the commercialisation.\n* Note on Non\u2010IFRS Measure\n: Operating EBITDA is a non\u2010IFRS measure used by the Company, defined as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation, adjusted for certain non\u2010operating items that the Company believes do not directly reflect its core operating performance.\nForward\u2010Looking Statements:\nThis announcement may contain forward\u2010looking statements based on current expectations and assumptions. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise forward\u2010looking statements except as required by law.

This forms part of Kanabo's expansion plan, as set out in the 2023 yearly report, to expand the in-pharmacy clinic franchise and provide accessible healthcare solutions.\nKanabo has also made significant progress in its ambitions to introduce safe yet innovative technologies to the digital health space. These include:\n\u00b7\nA new pilot programme was launched for an AI chat-to-prescription service, which has already seen some prescriptions successfully dispensed. The Company believes this could assist medical professionals with the triage process and help streamline prescriptions.\n\u00b7\nThe G.P. Services (UK) Ltd, the Company's fully owned subsidiary, has upgraded the e-Script system, allowing patients to have their prescription filled at any pharmacy in the UK.\nOther H1 2024 Highlights:\n\u25cf\nKanabo signed with over 250 referral pharmacies, who will be able to refer patients to the online Treat-It clinic, further expanding the reach and accessibility of Kanabo's services, as announced on 4 June 2024.\n\u25cf\nKanabo has introduced a new medical cannabis formulary system, with real-time supply chain inventory management which will improve both product information availability for medical professionals and product access for patients, to select partners as part of an initial trial.\n\u25cf\nKanabo's partially owned subsidiary, Kanabo Agritec Ltd (\"Agritec\"), received a payment of approximately \u20ac292 from the project during H1 2024, representing 77% of the payments of Phase 1. The Group continue to work with Taima to complete Phase 1 of the project, at which point, the Spanish Agency of Medicines and Medical Devices (\"AEMPS\") will inspect the facility. Subject to successfully passing the inspection, AEMPS will grant a licence for the production and manufacturing of cannabis and its products. With the Group's support, Taima will then move on to the delivery of Phase 2, which - upon successful conclusions would result in the facility being fully operational for the production of cannabis flowers.\nH1 2024 Financial update:\n\u25cf\nKanabo achieved a substantial 55% increase in revenues over the same period last year, reaching \u00a3694k in H1 2024 (H1 2023: \u00a3449k), demonstrating ongoing commercial progress.\n\u25cf\nThe operating EBITDA loss for H1 2024 was \u00a30.98m; this was reduced 10% compared to H1 2023 (\u00a31.1m) and 42% compared to H1 2022 (\u00a31.7m) with strategic initiatives driving improved financial performance.\n\u25cf\nOn 30 June 2024, the cash position of the group was \u00a32,086,000 (cash and cash equivalents of \u00a31,544,000 and short-term deposits of \u00a3542,000).\nPost Period End and Outlook:\n\u25cf\nMedical inhaler certification pending\n- Our partner team, responsible for corresponding with the Notified Body, has submitted revisions to the application file for our medical device, pursuant to a request from the Notified Body. At this time the issuance of a certification is pending the Notified Body's further review of the application.\n\u25cf\nPositive outlook for growth\n- The Board remains confident in both the short and medium-term prospects for the Company. We believe our innovative new products and commitment to technological innovation will help the Company grow during this period of sustained pressure on the medical sector.\nLooking forward, the company aims to build upon the strategic goals set out in the 2024 annual financial report, including:\n1. Launching New Medical Cannabis Products to enhance patient offerings and increase profit margins.\n2. Expanding adoption of our E-script system across more pharmacies in the U.K. and exploring international opportunities.\n3. Move from pilot to full-scale launch by year-end, enhancing consultation capacity and patient retention.\n4.

This demonstrates effective cost management and increases operational efficiency.\nIn May 2023, the\nCompany completed a \u00a32.74 million fundraising round, which was strongly supported by both new and existing investors, including significant participation from our senior team. On 31 December 2023, the Company maintained a strong cash position of \u00a33.2m, which was consistent with the cash position at the end of 2022.\n2023 corporate update:\nLaunch of the Treat It online clinic\nThe Company launched the Treat It online clinic, enhancing its digital health platform with specialised pain management and mental health services using Medical Cannabis. Treat It seamlessly integrates with NHS medical records for real-time access, crucial for immediate, specialised consultations and prescriptions. This capability allows Kanabo to provide rapid, direct care. Our efficient use of existing e-prescription services facilitates swift growth without significant investment in new development.\nNew Product Introductions\nKanabo launched two new medicinal cannabis extract formulations, tailored for day and night use, designed specifically for inhalation, and catering to the needs of patients with chronic, severe pain.\nKanabo Agritec Developments\nThe Company's Agritec division secured its first contract to develop a medicinal Cannabis cultivation facility in Madrid, Spain. This highlights Kanabo's agricultural technology and consultancy growth, which generated over \u20ac500K in revenue in 2024.\nBoard and Management Strengthening\nThe appointment of Ian Mattioli as Chair and Sharon Malka as Non-Executive Director strengthens our board with extensive experience in healthcare and technology, aligning with our strategic growth initiatives.\nPost-Year-End Developments:\nPost-period, we expanded our Treat It clinic services with a dedicated Mental Health clinic. Launched to support individuals suffering from conditions such as anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and insomnia, this expansion enables us to reach a wider audience seeking specialised care.\nMost recently, we announced a partnership with City Dock Pharmacy in Wapping, London, to launch the UK's first walk-in pain clinic, enhancing our community-based healthcare offerings. Following the successful pilot at City Dock, we have expanded our in-pharmacy clinic model to Village Pharmacy Bramhall, Manchester. The Company is expected to establish over 10 walk-in clinics by the end of the year and more than 50 referral pharmacies, significantly enhancing both our network and patient access across the country.\nFuture Outlook and Strategi",

This expansion comes at a time when national mental health infrastructure is under extreme pressure, and this service will allow individuals who are suffering from conditions such as anxiety, PTSD or ADHD to securely access to treatments through the Group's digital health platform.\nAs with Treat It's existing pain management offering, the mental health service will focus on secondary care, including prescriptions for alternative medications such as medical cannabis. While studies on the efficacy of medical cannabis in this area remain nascent, some evidence indicates that medicinal cannabis may help alleviate symptoms of conditions such as PTSD.\nMental Health in the UK\nIn 2022, around one in six adults experienced moderate to severe depressive symptoms, an increase from pre-pandemic levels. In the fourth quarter of 2023, around 22% of the adult population experienced a high level of anxiety. The non-profit organisation PTSD Today estimates that around 1 in 10 people in the UK, or around 6.6 million people, might experience PTSD during their lifetime. Meanwhile, mental health services are underserved, with the national situation being described as a crisis or an emergency. This new Clinic offering will provide patients for whom other therapies and medications may not have worked with new opportunities to treat their ailments.\nProgression in Line with Half-Year Results\nThis achievement aligns with the Company's current corporate goals, as laid out in its Half-Year Results (published 29 Sept 2023). In 2024, alongside expanding its secondary care offerings to include specialist mental health services, Kanabo has launched two in-pharmacy clinics (as announced on 15 January 2024) to establish a physical presence for its clinics. The Company plans to continue this momentum by expanding its primary care services and extending its footprint into the EU market in the near future.\nAvihu Tamir, CEO, commented:\n\"Since mental health is the second largest indication for medical cannabis prescriptions in the UK, our expansion into these services is poised to significantly increase our patient intake, revolutionising access and treatment options for those in need.\"\nDr Mehran Afshar, Chief Clinical Director of Treat It, commented:\n\"Mental health is an integral part of overall well-being, yet it often remains overlooked or stigmatised. By expanding our digital health platform to include mental health treatments, we aim to provide patients with access to alternative therapies and raise awareness and destigmatise these conditions. Our multidisciplinary team will work closely with patients to develop personalised treatment plans tailored to their unique needs and circumstances.\"\nEnquiries:\nKanabo Group plc\nAvihu Tamir, Chief Executive Officer\nAssaf Vardimon, Chief Financial Officer\nIan Mattioli, Non-Executive Chair of the Board\nvia Vigo Consulting\n+44 (0)20 7390 0230\nPeterhouse Capital Limited (Financial Adviser and Broker)\nEran Zucker\n/\nLucy Williams\n/\nCharles Goodfellow\n+44 (0)20 7469 0930\nVigo Consulting (Financial Public Relations/Investor Relations)\nJeremy Garcia / Fiona Hetherington / Verity Snow\nkanabo@vigoconsulting.com\n+44 (0)20 7390 0230\nAbout Kanabo Group plc\nKanabo Group plc (LSE:KNB) is a digital health company committed to transforming patient care through its innovative technology platform and specialised treatment offerings.

This reform, removing medical cannabis from the purview of the Narcotics Act (BtMG), signals a significant move towards a more accessible and patient-centred medical cannabis market in Germany, which is anticipated to become a cornerstone market for Kanabo.\nThe newly adopted legislation introduces a simplified patient prescription process and lays the groundwork for substantial market growth. Highlights of this legislative change include:\n?\nReclassification as a Prescription Medication:\nStarting April 2024, medical cannabis will no longer be classified under the Narcotics Act (BtMG), making prescriptions more straightforward and accessible.\n?\nEnhanced Patient Access:\nThe reform is poised to increase patient access to medical cannabis treatments, streamlining the prescription process and reducing the regulatory complexity that previously hindered access.\n?\nMarket Expansion Opportunities:\nThese changes to the regulation are expected to catalyze growth within the medical cannabis markets in the European Union, presenting opportunities for strategic expansions.\nAvihu Tamir, Chief Executive Officer of Kanabo, commented:\n\"This is a historic day for the medical cannabis industry. With Germany poised to emerge as one of the world's largest markets for medical cannabis, Kanabo anticipates significant growth opportunities within this evolving landscape. We are in negotiations with strategic distributors for Kanabo's products that the directors believe should materialise in the future and the Company will update the market in due course.\"\nThis legislative milestone aligns perfectly with Kanabo's strategic objectives to broaden our footprint across the EU, as outlined in our half-year report on 29 September 2023.\nEnquiries:\nKanabo Group plc\nAvihu Tamir, Chief Executive Officer\nAssaf Vardimon, Chief Financial Officer\nIan Mattioli, Non-Executive Chair of the Board\nvia Vigo Consulting\n+44 (0)20 7390 0230\nPeterhouse Capital Limited (Financial Adviser and Broker)\nEran Zucker / Lucy Williams / Charles Goodfellow\n+44 (0)20 7469 0930\nVigo Consulting (Financial Public Relations/Investor Relations)\nJeremy Garcia / Fiona Hetherington / Verity Snow\nkanabo@vigoconsulting.com\n+44 (0)20 7390 0230\nAbout Kanabo Group plc\nKanabo Group plc (LSE:KNB) is a digital health company committed to transforming patient care through its innovative technology platform and specialised treatment offerings.

(\"Agritec\"), has now received an advance payment of over EUR 200,000 from its contract with Taima. Agritec is providing consulting services and equipment and expects a further payment of an equal amount upon completion of Phase 1, totalling over\nEUR\n500,000 in revenue for Agritec.\nAgritec provides consulting services for facility planning, design, and implementation to produce medical cannabis. Its expertise includes choosing genetics, automating irrigation and fertigation, installing humidity control systems, and optimising harvest through bespoke solutions.\nTaima was incorporated as an SPV (special purpose vehicle) in 2019 and is seeking to establish a network of facilities for the cultivation and distribution of medical-grade cannabis in Spain. Notably, partners from Aurea Capital Partners, a Spanish investment firm focusing on renewable energy and sustainable agriculture, are invested in the project. Agritec currently holds 5% of Taima's issued share capital, and its shareholding will incrementally increase up to 20% based on the achievement of specific milestones.\nAvihu Tamir, Kanabo Group Plc CEO:\n\"I am encouraged by the progress of Agritec's first venture and our strategic collaboration with Taima. This strategy is integral to our expansion, especially as we leverage our established distribution channels in the UK. This initiative is a significant step towards enhancing our supply chain and producing high-quality medical cannabis products. It prioritises quality and competitive pricing, enabling scalable growth. Our focus on these areas, combined with Agritec's expertise, makes Kanabo Group a long-term player with a built-in advantage in the industry.\"\nThe Project\nThe project is running in two stages, with Phase 1 currently underway. Following completion of Phase 1, the Spanish Agency of Medicines and Medical Devices (\"AEMPS\") will inspect the facility and will grant a license for the production and manufacturing of medical cannabis and its products, subject to the successful passing of the inspection.\nUpon receipt of the licence, the directors of Kanabo believe that Agritec will implement Phase 2 of the project, which Agritec expects to last between 8 and 12 months. At the conclusion of Phase 2, the facility will be fully operational and capable of producing up to 3,000 kg of cannabis flowers annually.\nEnquiries:\nKanabo Group plc\nAvihu Tamir, Chief Executive Officer\nAssaf Vardimon, Chief Financial Officer\nIan Mattioli, Non-Executive Chair of the Board\nvia Vigo Consulting\n+44 (0)20 7390 0230\nPeterhouse Capital Limited (Financial Adviser and Broker)\nEran Zucker\n/\nLucy Williams\n/\nCharles Goodfellow\n+44 (0)20 7469 0930\nVigo Consulting (Financial Public Relations/Investor Relations)\nJeremy Garcia / Fiona Hetherington / Verity Snow\nkanabo@vigoconsulting.com\n+44 (0)20 7390 0230\nAbout Kanabo Group plc\nKanabo Group plc (LSE:KNB) is a digital health company committed to transforming patient care through its innovative technology platform and specialised treatment offerings.

The clinic will leverage Kanabo's Treat It online platform, and pharmacists will be on hand to guide patients through the medicinal cannabis treatment options. Furthermore, the clinic supports the delivery of personalised treatment plans for the growing number of chronic pain sufferers in the UK, who often face difficulties accessing medical treatments due to long waiting times, bureaucracy and affordability.\nThe partnership with City Dock Pharmacy will combine Kanabo's expertise in medicinal cannabis with traditional treatments for pain management and will cater for patients who are eligible for alternative therapies, as traditional treatments have not delivered improvements. The partnership with City Dock Pharmacy should result in an increase of patients who receive treatment through Kanabo's Treat It platform.\nThe launch of the walk-in pain clinic with City Dock Pharmacy represents progress against the Group's strategy, as announced on 29 September 2023, to extend its reach into physical pharmacies across the UK offering Kanabo's services to patients. The Company will seek to replicate this model across more pharmacies, leveraging the extensive pharmacy network partnership in Kanabo's digital health division.\nAvihu Tamir, Chief Executive Officer of Kanabo, commented:\n\"This collaboration is a testament to our dedication to innovating in pain management.

(\"Agritec\"), has signed a contract with Taima Growth S.L. (\"Taima\"). The contract is for the development of an indoor medical cannabis cultivation and processing facility in Madrid, Spain (\"the Agreement\").\nKanabo Agritec provides consulting services around facility planning, design and implementation for the production of medical cannabis. Agritec's expertise includes choosing genetics, the automation of irrigation and fertigation, humidity control systems and optimising harvest through bespoke solutions.\nTaima was incorporated as a SPV (special purpose vehicle) in 2019 and is seeking to establish a network of facilities for the cultivation and distribution of medical-grade cannabis in Spain. Notably, partners from Aurea Capital Partners, a Spanish investment firm focusing on renewable energy and sustainable agriculture, are invested in the project. Aurea Capital Partners has a proven track record in sustainable investment, recently selling its first investment in Spain to Goldman Sachs. Agritec currently holds 5% of the issued share capital of Taima, and its shareholding will be incrementally increased by an additional 15% based on the achievement of specific milestones.\nAvihu Tamir, Chief Executive Officer of Kanabo, commented:\n\"Securing this agreement marks a pivotal step in Kanabo's roadmap. The high-quality supply chain that Agritec and Taima's partnership offers not only ensures access to premium materials but also promises to generate profits and enhance shareholder value for The Group. We're excited about this synergy and the immense potential it holds.\n\"We look forward to supporting Agritec and their work with Taima.\"\nThe Project\nThe project will run in two stages, with Phase 1 expected to begin in the next few months and last 12 months. Following completion of Phase 1, the Spanish Agency of Medicines and Medical Devices (\"AEMPS\") will inspect the facility and will grant a licence for production and manufacturing of Cannabis and its products, subject to the successful passing of the inspection.\nUpon receipt of the licence, Agritec is contracted to implement Phase 2 of the project, which is expected to last between 8 and 12 months. The facility will be fully operational at the conclusion of Phase 2 and will be capable of producing up to 3,000 kgs of cannabis flowers annually.\nRegarding\nrevenue generated from the Agreement, while specific numbers are pending finalisation of timelines, Agritec anticipates a significant financial yield from this pivotal project. Concrete figures are expected to be announced shortly but we are pleased to confirm that this contract represents a substantial opportunity for enhanced revenue generation. F\nurther information on projected revenue will be shared in due course.\nThe Agreement marks an important growth stage for the Group's subsidiary and will contribute to Kanabo's long term strategy to diversify and secure a reliable supply chain. The facility will also adopt Kanabo's high-quality manufacturing standards, ultimately facilitating patient access to the highest-quality products.\nEnquiries:\nKanabo Group plc\nAvihu Tamir, Chief Executive Officer\nAssaf Vardimon, Chief Financial Officer\nIan Mattioli, Non-Executive Chair of the Board\nvia\u00a0Vigo Consulting\n+44 (0)20 7390 0230\nPeterhouse Capital Ltd (Financial Adviser and Broker)\nEran Zucker / Lucy Williams / Charles Goodfellow\n+44 (0)20 7469 0930\nVigo Consulting\u00a0(Financial Public Relations/Investor Relations)\nJeremy Garcia\u00a0/\u00a0Fiona Hetherington / Verity Snow\nkanabo@vigoconsulting.com\n+44 (0)20 7390 0230\nAbout Kanabo Group Plc\nKanabo Group Plc\u00a0(LSE:KNB)\u00a0is a healthtech company committed to revolutionising patient care through its innovative technology platform and disruptive product offerings.

The new clinic aims to address the issue of limited access to pain management treatments for the approximately 8 million chronic pain sufferers in the UK. These individuals face difficulties accessing medical treatments due to long waiting times, bureaucracy, and affordability. According to recent data, 24% of chronic pain sufferers in the UK are currently being prescribed opioids, making up approximately 3 million of the potential patients who can benefit from switching to medicinal cannabis.\nTreat It\nenables patients to access healthcare professionals via Kanabo's secure, digital healthcare platform. It will be focused on secondary care, including the prescription of medicinal cannabis. Studies have shown that medicinal cannabis can relieve pain for a range of common chronic pain conditions. Kanabo's existing online clinic, The GP Service, offers patients access to experienced healthcare professionals who can offer a broad range of treatment recommendations for primary care.\nThe growing demand for pain management treatments using medicinal cannabis is reflected in the increase in medical cannabis prescriptions issued in the UK, with over 89,000 issued between November 2018 and July 2022, indicating an average growth rate of approximately 72% per year, with more than 100% growth in 2022.\nAvihu Tamir, CEO of Kanabo Group said:\n\"Our innovative healthcare platform,\nTreat It\n, seeks to directly address the limited access to pain management treatments for patients across the UK. Leveraging our proprietary technology from The GP Service, which we have recently integrated, we have created an online ecosystem for chronic pain sufferers, providing access to doctors and medicinal cannabis prescriptions. Our goal is to offer patients direct access to high-quality medical treatments; empowering patients to take control of their own personalised care.\"\nTreat It\nforms part of the Company's growing technology stack, and combines proprietary digital tools and a treatment portfolio, including patient access, online consultations, prescriptions, and medication dispensing, into an integrated end-to-end solution. This unified approach offers patients efficient and effective access to qualified medical practitioners. Kanabo's treatment portfolio focuses on pain management using medications and treatments, including medicinal cannabis, which is currently unavailable through traditional channels. However, demand for these products is growing as patients seek alternative pain management options.\nTreat It\nis regulated by The Care Quality Commission and certified with ISO 27001 for information security, will allow doctors registered with the General Medical Council to prescribe medicinal cannabis to patients while following the guidelines set out by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.\nEnquiries:\nKanabo Group plc\nAvihu Tamir, Chief Executive Officer\nAssaf Vardimon, Chief Financial Officer\nvia\u00a0Vigo Consulting\n+44 (0)20 7390 0230\nPeterhouse Capital Ltd (Financial Adviser)\nEran Zucker / Lucy Williams / Charles Goodfellow\n+44 (0)20 7469 0930\nVigo Consulting\u00a0(Financial Public Relations/Investor Relations)\nJeremy Garcia\u00a0/\u00a0Fiona Hetherington / Verity Snow\nkanabo@vigoconsulting.com\n+44 (0)20 7390 0230\nAbout Kanabo Group Plc\nKanabo Group Plc\n(LSE:KNB)\nis a Healthtech company committed to revolutionising patient care through its innovative technology platform and disruptive product offerings.

I would suggest others do the same, and to as many journalists as you can find. My gut feel is that Kanabo knowingly overpaid massively for The GP Service, only to offload it back at a fraction of the cost.  Shareholder monies will have evaporated, and with it being offloaded under suspension I imagine the audit trail goes with it. The directors involved here all appear known to each other. I suspect the UK directors resigned when they suspected something was wrong, as they didn't want to be associated with it. What did Kanabo ever actually produce? In reality we've seen some cheap vapes that could have been produced in China. Even more interesting is their fraudulent listings here : https://treat-it.clinic/clinics/ I am very familiar with Southwold, and know the pharmacy well.   Last week their pharmacy was listed as a referral centre for Treat IT.   This week they've been removed.   I spoke with the pharmacy and they've never heard of Treat IT (as I suspected). I believe they are just rotating around pharmacies on that site, pretending they have a connection..........when in reality they have none.",

Thus far I've emailed : investgations@ft.com dan.mccrum@ft.com info@tcij.org  (centre for investigative journalism) If you're pondering what to write, I've highlighted some of the following : - The steady resignation of directors leading up to the suspension - The transfer of shares by Ian Mattioli last year, which would have enabled them to be sold without disclosing a director deal - The peculiar recent filing by Kanabo plc on companies house, containing amended 2023 accounts (in which they declare they forgot to submit paperwork which excludes The GP Service from statutory audit) - The posting on the GP Service website that it had been acquired by Novomedica (company# 16437130) whose director is Suleman SACRANIE. The same man who led Kanabo to acquire it for \u00a314M in 2022 - The change in posting, removing that statement, and replacing it with 'Acquired by Levein Technologies Limited' whose director is a Sri Lankan individual. The company filings show no significant assets to make such an acquisition. - No RNS relating the GP Service - The appointment of Sharon Malka as a director of the GP Service during a period of suspension; Again no RNS - The GP Service themselves sending me an email to say they no longer have an association with Kanabo - No update on the Kanabo website, which still shows the GP Service association and a link to it - The Treat IT website references pharmacies which have no knowledge of their service - Kanabo products have been unavailable for months at any sales outlet - Avihu Tamir has stopped posting on any forum, including Linkedin, and there is no response from his email addresses - No response from my emails to their NOMAD Peterhouse Capital (and I have their director's email, who has responded once in the past) - No response from my email to their auditor MHA. They were in the news this year for audit failures, which doesn't inspire confidence https://www.cityam.com/mha-watchdog-opens-probe-over-audits-of-folded-construction-firm/ I could go on - The thing that will get this traction is personal impact stories, so I'd encourage you to share your situation with as many journalists as you can.",

If  THE GP SERVICE is trying to be no  affiliated with Kanabo, that maybe due to their previous threat of being struck off, resulting in them now not offering medical cannabis as one of their treatments and ive also noticed the Care Quality Commission  sign missing . I would expect any asset disposal  would need  shareholders approval and at present companies house still show Avihu and Sharon are still directors of THE GP SERVICE and it is still a subsidiary of the KANABO GROUP .but I still treat that with some caution due to their delayed updates. British Cannabis store/clinic is also in the mix hence the navigation from the Kanabo store and using the same doctors as the Treat it clinic but powered by the GPSERVICE so its worth keeping an eye on. Personally I think they have left their out of date website running  whilst retail shareholders have no updates to what's really happening but anything major would still need shareholder approval as it was shareholders money that purchased the GPSERVICE.",

Sulman Sacranie is also the director of this company to, so basically the GPService looks to be back in his hands.. Hes registered at companies house as 2 separate people but Prime Start Holdings LTD  links him to both companies On the out of date Kanabo Group website he is still displayed as a director The delay of the accounts and the GPService revenue need to be submitted I hope that any transactions or disposals are conducted within the Companies Act 2006 and with the best interest of the companies shareholders I am not going to email the group as I don't anticipate a response but the information I have viewed is in the public domain for other investors to view  and maybe give their own views .",

They operate an online marketplace that introduces patients (\"Patients\") to independent healthcare professionals or organisations (\"Healthcare Providers. Novamedica is trading as The GPService but that doesn't confirm that they own the GPService UK  however IMO  the cause concern would still lie with the director and his continued relationship he has with Kanabo Group and the Gpservice UK since his resignation.How would this platform be financially beneficial to Kanabo shareholders and how would the revenue income be managed ?This relationship  may not have breached the Companies Act 2006 yet but any disposal of the GPService looks very  questionable. You mentioned  Levein Technologies and after an AI  Google search,it reveals the name The  Levein Group, and it states that Suleman and Kanabo Avihu have a relationship  (maybe partnership) with this company, so that name has not come out of thin air. All these findings are accessible in the public domain",

From April the GP Service has  complied with the regulatory requirements at companies house with the accounts /confirmation statement to keep it running as a going concern with Sulcranie creating Novamedica platform  trading as The GP service whilst not carrying any medical liabilities possibly because the Doctors are self employed. With the Kanabo Group  IMO it looks like it has been purposely left to run into administration followed by a gaslighting Administration RNS about working alongside the administrators to look for ways to rescue the group, when in reality,in administration they have to hand over full control of the business, but does that still include the GP Service that lookss like to have been running as a solvent independent company . So the Group administration has now been registered at companies house together with late account / confirmation statement pending  whilst the GP Serviceis up to date and running. So since the temporary suspension and maybe a long time before it ,was their strategic planning aimed at protecting  the group or the gp service and their own pockets whilst screwing shareholders . If the Group survives in some capacity  and relists then we will need more than a miracle  but it looks like the GP Service has already been taken care of ,",

The partnership with British  Cannabis is also powered by the GP Service So if the administrators are now looking at strategic ways to save the business, will this recent disposal transaction end the support between GP Service and Treat It clinic/British Cannabis partnership?

This is a rare chance to put your stamp on a healthcare business at exactly the right moment. You will have the backing of an experienced global group, the autonomy to lead locally, and the mandate to build something credible, compliant, and profitable from the ground up.

If you thrive in regulated environments and want the authority to shape outcomes rather than manage symptoms, this role is for you.

You will be close to the detail when needed, and firmly focused on outcomes at all times.

Let's see what happens  !!",

The updates are few and far between, there is no promotion on the kanabo store, social media or general pro medical cannabis forums from the company.

Maybe it's more about European exposure than actually winning it as Curaleaf usually win,however it shows they are still in business and possibly looking for a route to expand into Europe . After reading from Companies House ,The GP service survived being struck off, and on observation the treatment access to medical cannabis being unavailable , As for overdue accounts I would expect that would be the responsibility of the Group rather than the GP service The Treat It clinic and GP service seem to be now working independently from each other , but could be powered by the same AI  that also allows them to enhance their partnership with with other clinics including British Cannabis . As there has been no updates since the de listing ,then we can only be observant with what information is  available  out there , IMO it looks like alls not lost yet but updates would be welcome .I can't imagine their Institutional investors sharing the same silence !!",

I would suggest others do the same, and to as many journalists as you can find. My gut feel is that Kanabo knowingly overpaid massively for The GP Service, only to offload it back at a fraction of the cost.  Shareholder monies will have evaporated, and with it being offloaded under suspension I imagine the audit trail goes with it. The directors involved here all appear known to each other. I suspect the UK directors resigned when they suspected something was wrong, as they didn't want to be associated with it. What did Kanabo ever actually produce? In reality we've seen some cheap vapes that could have been produced in China. Even more interesting is their fraudulent listings here : https://treat-it.clinic/clinics/ I am very familiar with Southwold, and know the pharmacy well.   Last week their pharmacy was listed as a referral centre for Treat IT.   This week they've been removed.   I spoke with the pharmacy and they've never heard of Treat IT (as I suspected). I believe they are just rotating around pharmacies on that site, pretending they have a connection..........when in reality they have none.",

Thus far I've emailed : investgations@ft.com dan.mccrum@ft.com info@tcij.org  (centre for investigative journalism) If you're pondering what to write, I've highlighted some of the following : - The steady resignation of directors leading up to the suspension - The transfer of shares by Ian Mattioli last year, which would have enabled them to be sold without disclosing a director deal - The peculiar recent filing by Kanabo plc on companies house, containing amended 2023 accounts (in which they declare they forgot to submit paperwork which excludes The GP Service from statutory audit) - The posting on the GP Service website that it had been acquired by Novomedica (company# 16437130) whose director is Suleman SACRANIE. The same man who led Kanabo to acquire it for \u00a314M in 2022 - The change in posting, removing that statement, and replacing it with 'Acquired by Levein Technologies Limited' whose director is a Sri Lankan individual. The company filings show no significant assets to make such an acquisition. - No RNS relating the GP Service - The appointment of Sharon Malka as a director of the GP Service during a period of suspension; Again no RNS - The GP Service themselves sending me an email to say they no longer have an association with Kanabo - No update on the Kanabo website, which still shows the GP Service association and a link to it - The Treat IT website references pharmacies which have no knowledge of their service - Kanabo products have been unavailable for months at any sales outlet - Avihu Tamir has stopped posting on any forum, including Linkedin, and there is no response from his email addresses - No response from my emails to their NOMAD Peterhouse Capital (and I have their director's email, who has responded once in the past) - No response from my email to their auditor MHA. They were in the news this year for audit failures, which doesn't inspire confidence https://www.cityam.com/mha-watchdog-opens-probe-over-audits-of-folded-construction-firm/ I could go on - The thing that will get this traction is personal impact stories, so I'd encourage you to share your situation with as many journalists as you can.",

If  THE GP SERVICE is trying to be no  affiliated with Kanabo, that maybe due to their previous threat of being struck off, resulting in them now not offering medical cannabis as one of their treatments and ive also noticed the Care Quality Commission  sign missing . I would expect any asset disposal  would need  shareholders approval and at present companies house still show Avihu and Sharon are still directors of THE GP SERVICE and it is still a subsidiary of the KANABO GROUP .but I still treat that with some caution due to their delayed updates. British Cannabis store/clinic is also in the mix hence the navigation from the Kanabo store and using the same doctors as the Treat it clinic but powered by the GPSERVICE so its worth keeping an eye on. Personally I think they have left their out of date website running  whilst retail shareholders have no updates to what's really happening but anything major would still need shareholder approval as it was shareholders money that purchased the GPSERVICE.",

You mentioned  Levein Technologies and after an AI  Google search,it reveals the name The  Levein Group, and it states that Suleman and Kanabo Avihu have a relationship  (maybe partnership) with this company, so that name has not come out of thin air.

From April the GP Service has  complied with the regulatory requirements at companies house with the accounts /confirmation statement to keep it running as a going concern with Sulcranie creating Novamedica platform  trading as The GP service whilst not carrying any medical liabilities possibly because the Doctors are self employed. With the Kanabo Group  IMO it looks like it has been purposely left to run into administration followed by a gaslighting Administration RNS about working alongside the administrators to look for ways to rescue the group, when in reality,in administration they have to hand over full control of the business, but does that still include the GP Service that lookss like to have been running as a solvent independent company . So the Group administration has now been registered at companies house together with late account / confirmation statement pending  whilst the GP Serviceis up to date and running. So since the temporary suspension and maybe a long time before it ,was their strategic planning aimed at protecting  the group or the gp service and their own pockets whilst screwing shareholders . If the Group survives in some capacity  and relists then we will need more than a miracle  but it looks like the GP Service has already been taken care of ,",

The partnership with British  Cannabis is also powered by the GP Service So if the administrators are now looking at strategic ways to save the business, will this recent disposal transaction end the support between GP Service and Treat It clinic/British Cannabis partnership?

Maven Growth were significant holders of the GP Service before the Kanabo Group acquisition. It looks like as a result of the recent sale of the GP Service, the undisclosed fee will be heading back to Kanabo GP Ltd. If this is true then it does not look good for Kanabo Group shareholders whilst Avihu and Sharon are directors of Kanabo GP Limited. Emails to HL and II may inform of the administration but looking back on all the delayed disclosures  before the GP Service acquisition by the Kanabo Group , there were proections in place for Maven Income & Growth and nothing for Kanabo Group shareholders,and all we have is Avihu gaslighting about efforts in this administration to save the company but don't hold your breath.",

This is a rare chance to put your stamp on a healthcare business at exactly the right moment. You will have the backing of an experienced global group, the autonomy to lead locally, and the mandate to build something credible, compliant, and profitable from the ground up. The clinic has recently been acquired by a highly successful international telehealth group and now needs a Country General Manager who can stabilise, rebuild, and grow the operation with confidence, pace, and rigour. If you thrive in regulated environments and want the authority to shape outcomes rather than manage symptoms, this role is for you. Why this role is different True GM accountability: full P&L ownership, not just operational oversight High-impact turnaround: you will lead the reset and set the future direction Commercial freedom with guardrails: build growth that works within regulation Board-level influence: UK lead and member of the global executive team Massive market opportunity: one of the UK\u2019s fastest-evolving therapeutic areas Remote-first with real autonomy and trust What you\u2019ll be trusted to do You will be the person who brings clarity and momentum. In your first year, you will: Stabilise the business post-acquisition and restore confidence with regulators, clinicians, suppliers, and patients Shape a compliant operating model that is ready to scale Take full ownership of financial performance and drive the business to sustainable profitability Build a commercially disciplined growth engine with controlled patient acquisition costs Lead and align clinical and non-clinical teams around clear goals and accountability This is a hands-on leadership role. You will be close to the detail when needed, and firmly focused on outcomes at all times. Who this will suit You are likely already operating at senior level in healthcare, telehealth, or another tightly regulated environment. Experience in medical cannabis or like sectors is a strong advantage, but not essential. You bring: Proven experience running or turning around a regulated healthcare business Comfort owning a P&L and making commercially tough decisions The credibility to work confidently with clinicians, regulators, Boards, and investors A calm, decisive leadership style when the pressure is on A patient-first mindset paired with sharp commerci",

From April the GP Service has  complied with the regulatory requirements at companies house with the accounts /confirmation statement to keep it running as a going concern with Sulcranie creating Novamedica platform  trading as The GP service whilst not carrying any medical liabilities possibly because the Doctors are self employed. With the Kanabo Group  IMO it looks like it has been purposely left to run into administration followed by a gaslighting Administration RNS about working alongside the administrators to look for ways to rescue the group, when in reality,in administration they have to hand over full control of the business, but does that still include the GP Service that lookss like to have been running as a solvent independent company . So the Group administration has now been registered at companies house together with late account / confirmation statement pending  whilst the GP Serviceis up to date and running. So since the temporary suspension and maybe a long time before it ,was their strategic planning aimed at protecting  the group or the gp service and their own pockets whilst screwing shareholders . If the Group survives in some capacity  and relists then we will need more than a miracle  but it looks like the GP Service has already been taken care of ,",

What happens to the Treat IT clinic ? It was powered  by the GP Service  and is still functioning? The partnership with British  Cannabis is also powered by the GP Service So if the administrators are now looking at strategic ways to save the business, will this recent disposal transaction end the support between GP Service and Treat It clinic/British Cannabis partnership? IMO the rapid disposal still looks suspicious due to the previous actions with Novimedica etc and what if any assets are still viable as a going concern and if so, what delayed accounts are now submitted to companies house after this disposal.",

          "content": "For me the most interesting thing to happen recently is that Avihu Tamir has broken his LinkedIn radio silence.........last week he was promoting a General Manager position for Telehealth...........no doubt rising from the ashes, funded by shareholders. \"About the job Role: General Manager, UK Telehealth Clinic, Medical Cannabis (CBPMs) Location: UK (remote) Compensation: \u00a390,000 base + up to \u00a330,000 bonus (OTE \u00a3120,000) The opportunity We are looking for a commercially sharp, credible healthcare leader to take full ownership of a CQC-registered telehealth clinic at a pivotal moment in its journey. This is a rare chance to put your stamp on a healthcare business at exactly the right moment. You will have the backing of an experienced global group, the autonomy to lead locally, and the mandate to build something credible, compliant, and profitable from the ground up. The clinic has recently been acquired by a highly successful international telehealth group and now needs a Country General Manager who can stabilise, rebuild, and grow the operation with confidence, pace, and rigour. If you thrive in regulated environments and want the authority to shape outcomes rather than manage symptoms, this role is for you. Why this role is different True GM accountability: full P&L ownership, not just operational oversight High-impact turnaround: you will lead the reset and set the future direction Commercial freedom with guardrails: build growth that works within regulation Board-level influence: UK lead and member of the global executive team Massive market opportunity: one of the UK\u2019s fastest-evolving therapeutic areas Remote-first with real autonomy and trust What you\u2019ll be trusted to do You will be the person who brings clarity and momentum. In your first year, you will: Stabilise the business post-acquisition and restore confidence with regulators, clinicians, suppliers, and patients Shape a compliant operating model that is ready to scale Take full ownership of financial performance and drive the business to sustainable profitability Build a commercially disciplined growth engine with controlled patient acquisition costs Lead and align clinical and non-clinical teams around clear goals and accountability This is a hands-on leadership role. You will be close to the detail when needed, and firmly focused on outcomes at all times. Who this will suit You are likely already operating at senior level in healthcare, telehealth, or another tightly regulated environment. Experience in medical cannabis or like sectors is a strong advantage, but not essential. You bring: Proven experience running or turning around a regulated healthcare business Comfort owning a P&L and making commercially tough decisions The credibility to work confidently with clinicians, regulators, Boards, and investors A calm, decisive leadership style when the pressure is on A patient-first mindset paired with sharp commerci",

Maven Growth were significant holders of the GP Service before the Kanabo Group acquisition. It looks like as a result of the recent sale of the GP Service, the undisclosed fee will be heading back to Kanabo GP Ltd. If this is true then it does not look good for Kanabo Group shareholders whilst Avihu and Sharon are directors of Kanabo GP Limited. Emails to HL and II may inform of the administration but looking back on all the delayed disclosures  before the GP Service acquisition by the Kanabo Group , there were proections in place for Maven Income & Growth and nothing for Kanabo Group shareholders,and all we have is Avihu gaslighting about efforts in this administration to save the company but don't hold your breath.",

The Company is also continuing to assess its capital needs and funding requirements, including potential fundraising alternatives. In light of the uncertainty regarding the Company's financial position, the Company anticipates that completion and publication of the Company's audited accounts for the year ended 31 December 2024 will be delayed.

This is a rare chance to put your stamp on a healthcare business at exactly the right moment. You will have the backing of an experienced global group, the autonomy to lead locally, and the mandate to build something credible, compliant, and profitable from the ground up. The clinic has recently been acquired by a highly successful international telehealth group and now needs a Country General Manager who can stabilise, rebuild, and grow the operation with confidence, pace, and rigour. If you thrive in regulated environments and want the authority to shape outcomes rather than manage symptoms, this role is for you. Why this role is different True GM accountability: full P&L ownership, not just operational oversight High-impact turnaround: you will lead the reset and set the future direction Commercial freedom with guardrails: build growth that works within regulation Board-level influence: UK lead and member of the global executive team Massive market opportunity: one of the UK\u2019s fastest-evolving therapeutic areas Remote-first with real autonomy and trust What you\u2019ll be trusted to do You will be the person who brings clarity and momentum. In your first year, you will: Stabilise the business post-acquisition and restore confidence with regulators, clinicians, suppliers, and patients Shape a compliant operating model that is ready to scale Take full ownership of financial performance and drive the business to sustainable profitability Build a commercially disciplined growth engine with controlled patient acquisition costs Lead and align clinical and non-clinical teams around clear goals and accountability This is a hands-on leadership role. You will be close to the detail when needed, and firmly focused on outcomes at all times. Who this will suit You are likely already operating at senior level in healthcare, telehealth, or another tightly regulated environment. Experience in medical cannabis or like sectors is a strong advantage, but not essential. You bring: Proven experience running or turning around a regulated healthcare business Comfort owning a P&L and making commercially tough decisions The credibility to work confidently with clinicians, regulators, Boards, and investors A calm, decisive leadership style when the pressure is on A patient-first mindset paired with sharp commerci",

What happens to the Treat IT clinic ? It was powered  by the GP Service  and is still functioning? The partnership with British  Cannabis is also powered by the GP Service So if the administrators are now looking at strategic ways to save the business, will this recent disposal transaction end the support between GP Service and Treat It clinic/British Cannabis partnership? IMO the rapid disposal still looks suspicious due to the previous actions with Novimedica etc and what if any assets are still viable as a going concern and if so, what delayed accounts are now submitted to companies house after this disposal.",

From April the GP Service has  complied with the regulatory requirements at companies house with the accounts /confirmation statement to keep it running as a going concern with Sulcranie creating Novamedica platform  trading as The GP service whilst not carrying any medical liabilities possibly because the Doctors are self employed. With the Kanabo Group  IMO it looks like it has been purposely left to run into administration followed by a gaslighting Administration RNS about working alongside the administrators to look for ways to rescue the group, when in reality,in administration they have to hand over full control of the business, but does that still include the GP Service that lookss like to have been running as a solvent independent company . So the Group administration has now been registered at companies house together with late account / confirmation statement pending  whilst the GP Serviceis up to date and running. So since the temporary suspension and maybe a long time before it ,was their strategic planning aimed at protecting  the group or the gp service and their own pockets whilst screwing shareholders . If the Group survives in some capacity  and relists then we will need more than a miracle  but it looks like the GP Service has already been taken care of ,",

IMO this suspension was preplanned including the resignation of Sulcranie and  Novamedica acquired the GPSERVICE issue.

( Possible a way to navigate around the questions of association) The Kanabo Group website has purposely not been updated and the link is still live to the GPService  and Avihu and Sharon are still directors at companies house ,so we can only speculate as to what may be the case and whether they have been transparent to its  shareholders  leading up to and throughout this  temporary suspension. So I will wait for them to finally show their hand when they update the market  to see if anything they say is plausible.",

They operate an online marketplace that introduces patients (\"Patients\") to independent healthcare professionals or organisations (\"Healthcare Providers. Novamedica is trading as The GPService but that doesn't confirm that they own the GPService UK  however IMO  the cause concern would still lie with the director and his continued relationship he has with Kanabo Group and the Gpservice UK since his resignation.How would this platform be financially beneficial to Kanabo shareholders and how would the revenue income be managed ?This relationship  may not have breached the Companies Act 2006 yet but any disposal of the GPService looks very  questionable. You mentioned  Levein Technologies and after an AI  Google search,it reveals the name The  Levein Group, and it states that Suleman and Kanabo Avihu have a relationship  (maybe partnership) with this company, so that name has not come out of thin air. All these findings are accessible in the public domain",

I would expect any asset disposal  would need  shareholders approval and at present companies house still show Avihu and Sharon are still directors of THE GP SERVICE and it is still a subsidiary of the KANABO GROUP .but I still treat that with some caution due to their delayed updates. British Cannabis store/clinic is also in the mix hence the navigation from the Kanabo store and using the same doctors as the Treat it clinic but powered by the GPSERVICE so its worth keeping an eye on. Personally I think they have left their out of date website running  whilst retail shareholders have no updates to what's really happening but anything major would still need shareholder approval as it was shareholders money that purchased the GPSERVICE.",

The same man who led Kanabo to acquire it for \u00a314M in 2022 - The change in posting, removing that statement, and replacing it with 'Acquired by Levein Technologies Limited' whose director is a Sri Lankan individual. The company filings show no significant assets to make such an acquisition. - No RNS relating the GP Service - The appointment of Sharon Malka as a director of the GP Service during a period of suspension; Again no RNS - The GP Service themselves sending me an email to say they no longer have an association with Kanabo - No update on the Kanabo website, which still shows the GP Service association and a link to it - The Treat IT website references pharmacies which have no knowledge of their service - Kanabo products have been unavailable for months at any sales outlet - Avihu Tamir has stopped posting on any forum, including Linkedin, and there is no response from his email addresses - No response from my emails to their NOMAD Peterhouse Capital (and I have their director's email, who has responded once in the past) - No response from my email to their auditor MHA. They were in the news this year for audit failures, which doesn't inspire confidence https://www.cityam.com/mha-watchdog-opens-probe-over-audits-of-folded-construction-firm/ I could go on - The thing that will get this traction is personal impact stories, so I'd encourage you to share your situation with as many journalists as you can.",

I would suggest others do the same, and to as many journalists as you can find. My gut feel is that Kanabo knowingly overpaid massively for The GP Service, only to offload it back at a fraction of the cost.  Shareholder monies will have evaporated, and with it being offloaded under suspension I imagine the audit trail goes with it. The directors involved here all appear known to each other. I suspect the UK directors resigned when they suspected something was wrong, as they didn't want to be associated with it. What did Kanabo ever actually produce? In reality we've seen some cheap vapes that could have been produced in China. Even more interesting is their fraudulent listings here : https://treat-it.clinic/clinics/ I am very familiar with Southwold, and know the pharmacy well.   Last week their pharmacy was listed as a referral centre for Treat IT.   This week they've been removed.   I spoke with the pharmacy and they've never heard of Treat IT (as I suspected). I believe they are just rotating around pharmacies on that site, pretending they have a connection..........when in reality they have none.",

The clinic has recently been acquired by a highly successful international telehealth group and now needs a Country General Manager who can stabilise, rebuild, and grow the operation with confidence, pace, and rigour. If you thrive in regulated environments and want the authority to shape outcomes rather than manage symptoms, this role is for you. Why this role is different True GM accountability: full P&L ownership, not just operational oversight High-impact turnaround: you will lead the reset and set the future direction Commercial freedom with guardrails: build growth that works within regulation Board-level influence: UK lead and member of the global executive team Massive market opportunity: one of the UK\u2019s fastest-evolving therapeutic areas Remote-first with real autonomy and trust What you\u2019ll be trusted to do You will be the person who brings clarity and momentum. In your first year, you will: Stabilise the business post-acquisition and restore confidence with regulators, clinicians, suppliers, and patients Shape a compliant operating model that is ready to scale Take full ownership of financial performance and drive the business to sustainable profitability Build a commercially disciplined growth engine with controlled patient acquisition costs Lead and align clinical and non-clinical teams around clear goals and accountability This is a hands-on leadership role. You will be close to the detail when needed, and firmly focused on outcomes at all times. Who this will suit You are likely already operating at senior level in healthcare, telehealth, or another tightly regulated environment. Experience in medical cannabis or like sectors is a strong advantage, but not essential. You bring: Proven experience running or turning around a regulated healthcare business Comfort owning a P&L and making commercially tough decisions The credibility to work confidently with clinicians, regulators, Boards, and investors A calm, decisive leadership style when the pressure is on A patient-first mindset paired with sharp commerci",

It looks like as a result of the recent sale of the GP Service, the undisclosed fee will be heading back to Kanabo GP Ltd.

What happens to the Treat IT clinic ? It was powered  by the GP Service  and is still functioning? The partnership with British  Cannabis is also powered by the GP Service So if the administrators are now looking at strategic ways to save the business, will this recent disposal transaction end the support between GP Service and Treat It clinic/British Cannabis partnership? IMO the rapid disposal still looks suspicious due to the previous actions with Novimedica etc and what if any assets are still viable as a going concern and if so, what delayed accounts are now submitted to companies house after this disposal.",

With the Kanabo Group  IMO it looks like it has been purposely left to run into administration followed by a gaslighting Administration RNS about working alongside the administrators to look for ways to rescue the group, when in reality,in administration they have to hand over full control of the business, but does that still include the GP Service that lookss like to have been running as a solvent independent company . So the Group administration has now been registered at companies house together with late account / confirmation statement pending  whilst the GP Serviceis up to date and running. So since the temporary suspension and maybe a long time before it ,was their strategic planning aimed at protecting  the group or the gp service and their own pockets whilst screwing shareholders . If the Group survives in some capacity  and relists then we will need more than a miracle  but it looks like the GP Service has already been taken care of ,",

But now if all else fails screw the shareholders who have had only an outdated website to view since the suspension and now facing losing all of their investment, If it survives it will be heavily diluted to gain financial support and confidence from it's creditors who may have been close to taking legal action .

Novamedica is trading as The GPService but that doesn't confirm that they own the GPService UK  however IMO  the cause concern would still lie with the director and his continued relationship he has with Kanabo Group and the Gpservice UK since his resignation.How would this platform be financially beneficial to Kanabo shareholders and how would the revenue income be managed ?This relationship  may not have breached the Companies Act 2006 yet but any disposal of the GPService looks very  questionable. You mentioned  Levein Technologies and after an AI  Google search,it reveals the name The  Levein Group, and it states that Suleman and Kanabo Avihu have a relationship  (maybe partnership) with this company, so that name has not come out of thin air.

If  THE GP SERVICE is trying to be no  affiliated with Kanabo, that maybe due to their previous threat of being struck off, resulting in them now not offering medical cannabis as one of their treatments and ive also noticed the Care Quality Commission  sign missing . I would expect any asset disposal  would need  shareholders approval and at present companies house still show Avihu and Sharon are still directors of THE GP SERVICE and it is still a subsidiary of the KANABO GROUP .but I still treat that with some caution due to their delayed updates. British Cannabis store/clinic is also in the mix hence the navigation from the Kanabo store and using the same doctors as the Treat it clinic but powered by the GPSERVICE so its worth keeping an eye on. Personally I think they have left their out of date website running  whilst retail shareholders have no updates to what's really happening but anything major would still need shareholder approval as it was shareholders money that purchased the GPSERVICE.",

Thus far I've emailed : investgations@ft.com dan.mccrum@ft.com info@tcij.org  (centre for investigative journalism) If you're pondering what to write, I've highlighted some of the following : - The steady resignation of directors leading up to the suspension - The transfer of shares by Ian Mattioli last year, which would have enabled them to be sold without disclosing a director deal - The peculiar recent filing by Kanabo plc on companies house, containing amended 2023 accounts (in which they declare they forgot to submit paperwork which excludes The GP Service from statutory audit) - The posting on the GP Service website that it had been acquired by Novomedica (company# 16437130) whose director is Suleman SACRANIE. The same man who led Kanabo to acquire it for \u00a314M in 2022 - The change in posting, removing that statement, and replacing it with 'Acquired by Levein Technologies Limited' whose director is a Sri Lankan individual. The company filings show no significant assets to make such an acquisition. - No RNS relating the GP Service - The appointment of Sharon Malka as a director of the GP Service during a period of suspension; Again no RNS - The GP Service themselves sending me an email to say they no longer have an association with Kanabo - No update on the Kanabo website, which still shows the GP Service association and a link to it - The Treat IT website references pharmacies which have no knowledge of their service - Kanabo products have been unavailable for months at any sales outlet - Avihu Tamir has stopped posting on any forum, including Linkedin, and there is no response from his email addresses - No response from my emails to their NOMAD Peterhouse Capital (and I have their director's email, who has responded once in the past) - No response from my email to their auditor MHA. They were in the news this year for audit failures, which doesn't inspire confidence https://www.cityam.com/mha-watchdog-opens-probe-over-audits-of-folded-construction-firm/ I could go on - The thing that will get this traction is personal impact stories, so I'd encourage you to share your situation with as many journalists as you can.",

I would suggest others do the same, and to as many journalists as you can find. My gut feel is that Kanabo knowingly overpaid massively for The GP Service, only to offload it back at a fraction of the cost.  Shareholder monies will have evaporated, and with it being offloaded under suspension I imagine the audit trail goes with it. The directors involved here all appear known to each other. I suspect the UK directors resigned when they suspected something was wrong, as they didn't want to be associated with it. What did Kanabo ever actually produce? In reality we've seen some cheap vapes that could have been produced in China. Even more interesting is their fraudulent listings here : https://treat-it.clinic/clinics/ I am very familiar with Southwold, and know the pharmacy well.   Last week their pharmacy was listed as a referral centre for Treat IT.   This week they've been removed.   I spoke with the pharmacy and they've never heard of Treat IT (as I suspected). I believe they are just rotating around pharmacies on that site, pretending they have a connection..........when in reality they have none.",

This is a rare chance to put your stamp on a healthcare business at exactly the right moment. You will have the backing of an experienced global group, the autonomy to lead locally, and the mandate to build something credible, compliant, and profitable from the ground up. The clinic has recently been acquired by a highly successful international telehealth group and now needs a Country General Manager who can stabilise, rebuild, and grow the operation with confidence, pace, and rigour. If you thrive in regulated environments and want the authority to shape outcomes rather than manage symptoms, this role is for you. Why this role is different True GM accountability: full P&L ownership, not just operational oversight High-impact turnaround: you will lead the reset and set the future direction Commercial freedom with guardrails: build growth that works within regulation Board-level influence: UK lead and member of the global executive team Massive market opportunity: one of the UK\u2019s fastest-evolving therapeutic areas Remote-first with real autonomy and trust What you\u2019ll be trusted to do You will be the person who brings clarity and momentum. In your first year, you will: Stabilise the business post-acquisition and restore confidence with regulators, clinicians, suppliers, and patients Shape a compliant operating model that is ready to scale Take full ownership of financial performance and drive the business to sustainable profitability Build a commercially disciplined growth engine with controlled patient acquisition costs Lead and align clinical and non-clinical teams around clear goals and accountability This is a hands-on leadership role. You will be close to the detail when needed, and firmly focused on outcomes at all times. Who this will suit You are likely already operating at senior level in healthcare, telehealth, or another tightly regulated environment. Experience in medical cannabis or like sectors is a strong advantage, but not essential. You bring: Proven experience running or turning around a regulated healthcare business Comfort owning a P&L and making commercially tough decisions The credibility to work confidently with clinicians, regulators, Boards, and investors A calm, decisive leadership style when the pressure is on A patient-first mindset paired with sharp commerci",

What happens to the Treat IT clinic ? It was powered  by the GP Service  and is still functioning? The partnership with British  Cannabis is also powered by the GP Service So if the administrators are now looking at strategic ways to save the business, will this recent disposal transaction end the support between GP Service and Treat It clinic/British Cannabis partnership? IMO the rapid disposal still looks suspicious due to the previous actions with Novimedica etc and what if any assets are still viable as a going concern and if so, what delayed accounts are now submitted to companies house after this disposal.",

From April the GP Service has  complied with the regulatory requirements at companies house with the accounts /confirmation statement to keep it running as a going concern with Sulcranie creating Novamedica platform  trading as The GP service whilst not carrying any medical liabilities possibly because the Doctors are self employed. With the Kanabo Group  IMO it looks like it has been purposely left to run into administration followed by a gaslighting Administration RNS about working alongside the administrators to look for ways to rescue the group, when in reality,in administration they have to hand over full control of the business, but does that still include the GP Service that lookss like to have been running as a solvent independent company . So the Group administration has now been registered at companies house together with late account / confirmation statement pending  whilst the GP Serviceis up to date and running. So since the temporary suspension and maybe a long time before it ,was their strategic planning aimed at protecting  the group or the gp service and their own pockets whilst screwing shareholders . If the Group survives in some capacity  and relists then we will need more than a miracle  but it looks like the GP Service has already been taken care of ,",

Novamedica is trading as The GPService but that doesn't confirm that they own the GPService UK  however IMO  the cause concern would still lie with the director and his continued relationship he has with Kanabo Group and the Gpservice UK since his resignation.How would this platform be financially beneficial to Kanabo shareholders and how would the revenue income be managed ?This relationship  may not have breached the Companies Act 2006 yet but any disposal of the GPService looks very  questionable. You mentioned  Levein Technologies and after an AI  Google search,it reveals the name The  Levein Group, and it states that Suleman and Kanabo Avihu have a relationship  (maybe partnership) with this company, so that name has not come out of thin air.

If  THE GP SERVICE is trying to be no  affiliated with Kanabo, that maybe due to their previous threat of being struck off, resulting in them now not offering medical cannabis as one of their treatments and ive also noticed the Care Quality Commission  sign missing . I would expect any asset disposal  would need  shareholders approval and at present companies house still show Avihu and Sharon are still directors of THE GP SERVICE and it is still a subsidiary of the KANABO GROUP .but I still treat that with some caution due to their delayed updates. British Cannabis store/clinic is also in the mix hence the navigation from the Kanabo store and using the same doctors as the Treat it clinic but powered by the GPSERVICE so its worth keeping an eye on. Personally I think they have left their out of date website running  whilst retail shareholders have no updates to what's really happening but anything major would still need shareholder approval as it was shareholders money that purchased the GPSERVICE.",

Thus far I've emailed : investgations@ft.com dan.mccrum@ft.com info@tcij.org  (centre for investigative journalism) If you're pondering what to write, I've highlighted some of the following : - The steady resignation of directors leading up to the suspension - The transfer of shares by Ian Mattioli last year, which would have enabled them to be sold without disclosing a director deal - The peculiar recent filing by Kanabo plc on companies house, containing amended 2023 accounts (in which they declare they forgot to submit paperwork which excludes The GP Service from statutory audit) - The posting on the GP Service website that it had been acquired by Novomedica (company# 16437130) whose director is Suleman SACRANIE. The same man who led Kanabo to acquire it for \u00a314M in 2022 - The change in posting, removing that statement, and replacing it with 'Acquired by Levein Technologies Limited' whose director is a Sri Lankan individual. The company filings show no significant assets to make such an acquisition. - No RNS relating the GP Service - The appointment of Sharon Malka as a director of the GP Service during a period of suspension; Again no RNS - The GP Service themselves sending me an email to say they no longer have an association with Kanabo - No update on the Kanabo website, which still shows the GP Service association and a link to it - The Treat IT website references pharmacies which have no knowledge of their service - Kanabo products have been unavailable for months at any sales outlet - Avihu Tamir has stopped posting on any forum, including Linkedin, and there is no response from his email addresses - No response from my emails to their NOMAD Peterhouse Capital (and I have their director's email, who has responded once in the past) - No response from my email to their auditor MHA. They were in the news this year for audit failures, which doesn't inspire confidence https://www.cityam.com/mha-watchdog-opens-probe-over-audits-of-folded-construction-firm/ I could go on - The thing that will get this traction is personal impact stories, so I'd encourage you to share your situation with as many journalists as you can.",

I would suggest others do the same, and to as many journalists as you can find. My gut feel is that Kanabo knowingly overpaid massively for The GP Service, only to offload it back at a fraction of the cost.  Shareholder monies will have evaporated, and with it being offloaded under suspension I imagine the audit trail goes with it. The directors involved here all appear known to each other. I suspect the UK directors resigned when they suspected something was wrong, as they didn't want to be associated with it. What did Kanabo ever actually produce? In reality we've seen some cheap vapes that could have been produced in China. Even more interesting is their fraudulent listings here : https://treat-it.clinic/clinics/ I am very familiar with Southwold, and know the pharmacy well.   Last week their pharmacy was listed as a referral centre for Treat IT.   This week they've been removed.   I spoke with the pharmacy and they've never heard of Treat IT (as I suspected). I believe they are just rotating around pharmacies on that site, pretending they have a connection..........when in reality they have none.",

This is a rare chance to put your stamp on a healthcare business at exactly the right moment. You will have the backing of an experienced global group, the autonomy to lead locally, and the mandate to build something credible, compliant, and profitable from the ground up. The clinic has recently been acquired by a highly successful international telehealth group and now needs a Country General Manager who can stabilise, rebuild, and grow the operation with confidence, pace, and rigour. If you thrive in regulated environments and want the authority to shape outcomes rather than manage symptoms, this role is for you. Why this role is different True GM accountability: full P&L ownership, not just operational oversight High-impact turnaround: you will lead the reset and set the future direction Commercial freedom with guardrails: build growth that works within regulation Board-level influence: UK lead and member of the global executive team Massive market opportunity: one of the UK\u2019s fastest-evolving therapeutic areas Remote-first with real autonomy and trust What you\u2019ll be trusted to do You will be the person who brings clarity and momentum. In your first year, you will: Stabilise the business post-acquisition and restore confidence with regulators, clinicians, suppliers, and patients Shape a compliant operating model that is ready to scale Take full ownership of financial performance and drive the business to sustainable profitability Build a commercially disciplined growth engine with controlled patient acquisition costs Lead and align clinical and non-clinical teams around clear goals and accountability This is a hands-on leadership role. You will be close to the detail when needed, and firmly focused on outcomes at all times. Who this will suit You are likely already operating at senior level in healthcare, telehealth, or another tightly regulated environment. Experience in medical cannabis or like sectors is a strong advantage, but not essential. You bring: Proven experience running or turning around a regulated healthcare business Comfort owning a P&L and making commercially tough decisions The credibility to work confidently with clinicians, regulators, Boards, and investors A calm, decisive leadership style when the pressure is on A patient-first mindset paired with sharp commerci",

It looks like as a result of the recent sale of the GP Service, the undisclosed fee will be heading back to Kanabo GP Ltd.

Emails to HL and II may inform of the administration but looking back on all the delayed disclosures  before the GP Service acquisition by the Kanabo Group , there were proections in place for Maven Income & Growth and nothing for Kanabo Group shareholders,and all we have is Avihu gaslighting about efforts in this administration to save the company but don't hold your breath.",

What happens to the Treat IT clinic ? It was powered  by the GP Service  and is still functioning? The partnership with British  Cannabis is also powered by the GP Service So if the administrators are now looking at strategic ways to save the business, will this recent disposal transaction end the support between GP Service and Treat It clinic/British Cannabis partnership? IMO the rapid disposal still looks suspicious due to the previous actions with Novimedica etc and what if any assets are still viable as a going concern and if so, what delayed accounts are now submitted to companies house after this disposal.",

          "content": "The subsidiary GP service has Avihu and recently appointed Sharon as registered directors at companies house .They are registered seperate from their director role status at Kanabo Group even though the out of date website displays the GP service as part of the group. From April the GP Service has  complied with the regulatory requirements at companies house with the accounts /confirmation statement to keep it running as a going concern with Sulcranie creating Novamedica platform  trading as The GP service whilst not carrying any medical liabilities possibly because the Doctors are self employed. With the Kanabo Group  IMO it looks like it has been purposely left to run into administration followed by a gaslighting Administration RNS about working alongside the administrators to look for ways to rescue the group, when in reality,in administration they have to hand over full control of the business, but does that still include the GP Service that lookss like to have been running as a solvent independent company . So the Group administration has now been registered at companies house together with late account / confirmation statement pending  whilst the GP Serviceis up to date and running. So since the temporary suspension and maybe a long time before it ,was their strategic planning aimed at protecting  the group or the gp service and their own pockets whilst screwing shareholders . If the Group survives in some capacity  and relists then we will need more than a miracle  but it looks like the GP Service has already been taken care of ,",

IMO this suspension was preplanned including the resignation of Sulcranie and  Novamedica acquired the GPSERVICE issue. Obviously there's a lot to be suspicious about until we hear what they finally have to say !!",

They operate an online marketplace that introduces patients (\"Patients\") to independent healthcare professionals or organisations (\"Healthcare Providers. Novamedica is trading as The GPService but that doesn't confirm that they own the GPService UK  however IMO  the cause concern would still lie with the director and his continued relationship he has with Kanabo Group and the Gpservice UK since his resignation.How would this platform be financially beneficial to Kanabo shareholders and how would the revenue income be managed ?This relationship  may not have breached the Companies Act 2006 yet but any disposal of the GPService looks very  questionable. You mentioned  Levein Technologies and after an AI  Google search,it reveals the name The  Levein Group, and it states that Suleman and Kanabo Avihu have a relationship  (maybe partnership) with this company, so that name has not come out of thin air. All these findings are accessible in the public domain",

I would expect any asset disposal  would need  shareholders approval and at present companies house still show Avihu and Sharon are still directors of THE GP SERVICE and it is still a subsidiary of the KANABO GROUP .but I still treat that with some caution due to their delayed updates. British Cannabis store/clinic is also in the mix hence the navigation from the Kanabo store and using the same doctors as the Treat it clinic but powered by the GPSERVICE so its worth keeping an eye on. Personally I think they have left their out of date website running  whilst retail shareholders have no updates to what's really happening but anything major would still need shareholder approval as it was shareholders money that purchased the GPSERVICE.",

The same man who led Kanabo to acquire it for \u00a314M in 2022 - The change in posting, removing that statement, and replacing it with 'Acquired by Levein Technologies Limited' whose director is a Sri Lankan individual. The company filings show no significant assets to make such an acquisition. - No RNS relating the GP Service - The appointment of Sharon Malka as a director of the GP Service during a period of suspension; Again no RNS - The GP Service themselves sending me an email to say they no longer have an association with Kanabo - No update on the Kanabo website, which still shows the GP Service association and a link to it - The Treat IT website references pharmacies which have no knowledge of their service - Kanabo products have been unavailable for months at any sales outlet - Avihu Tamir has stopped posting on any forum, including Linkedin, and there is no response from his email addresses - No response from my emails to their NOMAD Peterhouse Capital (and I have their director's email, who has responded once in the past) - No response from my email to their auditor MHA. They were in the news this year for audit failures, which doesn't inspire confidence https://www.cityam.com/mha-watchdog-opens-probe-over-audits-of-folded-construction-firm/ I could go on - The thing that will get this traction is personal impact stories, so I'd encourage you to share your situation with as many journalists as you can.",

I would suggest others do the same, and to as many journalists as you can find. My gut feel is that Kanabo knowingly overpaid massively for The GP Service, only to offload it back at a fraction of the cost.  Shareholder monies will have evaporated, and with it being offloaded under suspension I imagine the audit trail goes with it. The directors involved here all appear known to each other. I suspect the UK directors resigned when they suspected something was wrong, as they didn't want to be associated with it. What did Kanabo ever actually produce? In reality we've seen some cheap vapes that could have been produced in China. Even more interesting is their fraudulent listings here : https://treat-it.clinic/clinics/ I am very familiar with Southwold, and know the pharmacy well.   Last week their pharmacy was listed as a referral centre for Treat IT.   This week they've been removed.   I spoke with the pharmacy and they've never heard of Treat IT (as I suspected). I believe they are just rotating around pharmacies on that site, pretending they have a connection..........when in reality they have none.",

This is a rare chance to put your stamp on a healthcare business at exactly the right moment. You will have the backing of an experienced global group, the autonomy to lead locally, and the mandate to build something credible, compliant, and profitable from the ground up. The clinic has recently been acquired by a highly successful international telehealth group and now needs a Country General Manager who can stabilise, rebuild, and grow the operation with confidence, pace, and rigour. If you thrive in regulated environments and want the authority to shape outcomes rather than manage symptoms, this role is for you. Why this role is different True GM accountability: full P&L ownership, not just operational oversight High-impact turnaround: you will lead the reset and set the future direction Commercial freedom with guardrails: build growth that works within regulation Board-level influence: UK lead and member of the global executive team Massive market opportunity: one of the UK\u2019s fastest-evolving therapeutic areas Remote-first with real autonomy and trust What you\u2019ll be trusted to do You will be the person who brings clarity and momentum.

You will be close to the detail when needed, and firmly focused on outcomes at all times. Who this will suit You are likely already operating at senior level in healthcare, telehealth, or another tightly regulated environment. Experience in medical cannabis or like sectors is a strong advantage, but not essential.

It looks like as a result of the recent sale of the GP Service, the undisclosed fee will be heading back to Kanabo GP Ltd. If this is true then it does not look good for Kanabo Group shareholders whilst Avihu and Sharon are directors of Kanabo GP Limited. Emails to HL and II may inform of the administration but looking back on all the delayed disclosures  before the GP Service acquisition by the Kanabo Group , there were proections in place for Maven Income & Growth and nothing for Kanabo Group shareholders,and all we have is Avihu gaslighting about efforts in this administration to save the company but don't hold your breath.",

What happens to the Treat IT clinic ? It was powered  by the GP Service  and is still functioning? The partnership with British  Cannabis is also powered by the GP Service So if the administrators are now looking at strategic ways to save the business, will this recent disposal transaction end the support between GP Service and Treat It clinic/British Cannabis partnership? IMO the rapid disposal still looks suspicious due to the previous actions with Novimedica etc and what if any assets are still viable as a going concern and if so, what delayed accounts are now submitted to companies house after this disposal.",

With the Kanabo Group  IMO it looks like it has been purposely left to run into administration followed by a gaslighting Administration RNS about working alongside the administrators to look for ways to rescue the group, when in reality,in administration they have to hand over full control of the business, but does that still include the GP Service that lookss like to have been running as a solvent independent company . So the Group administration has now been registered at companies house together with late account / confirmation statement pending  whilst the GP Serviceis up to date and running. So since the temporary suspension and maybe a long time before it ,was their strategic planning aimed at protecting  the group or the gp service and their own pockets whilst screwing shareholders . If the Group survives in some capacity  and relists then we will need more than a miracle  but it looks like the GP Service has already been taken care of ,",

You mentioned  Levein Technologies and after an AI  Google search,it reveals the name The  Levein Group, and it states that Suleman and Kanabo Avihu have a relationship  (maybe partnership) with this company, so that name has not come out of thin air.

If  THE GP SERVICE is trying to be no  affiliated with Kanabo, that maybe due to their previous threat of being struck off, resulting in them now not offering medical cannabis as one of their treatments and ive also noticed the Care Quality Commission  sign missing . I would expect any asset disposal  would need  shareholders approval and at present companies house still show Avihu and Sharon are still directors of THE GP SERVICE and it is still a subsidiary of the KANABO GROUP .but I still treat that with some caution due to their delayed updates. British Cannabis store/clinic is also in the mix hence the navigation from the Kanabo store and using the same doctors as the Treat it clinic but powered by the GPSERVICE so its worth keeping an eye on. Personally I think they have left their out of date website running  whilst retail shareholders have no updates to what's really happening but anything major would still need shareholder approval as it was shareholders money that purchased the GPSERVICE.",

Thus far I've emailed : investgations@ft.com dan.mccrum@ft.com info@tcij.org  (centre for investigative journalism) If you're pondering what to write, I've highlighted some of the following : - The steady resignation of directors leading up to the suspension - The transfer of shares by Ian Mattioli last year, which would have enabled them to be sold without disclosing a director deal - The peculiar recent filing by Kanabo plc on companies house, containing amended 2023 accounts (in which they declare they forgot to submit paperwork which excludes The GP Service from statutory audit) - The posting on the GP Service website that it had been acquired by Novomedica (company# 16437130) whose director is Suleman SACRANIE. The same man who led Kanabo to acquire it for \u00a314M in 2022 - The change in posting, removing that statement, and replacing it with 'Acquired by Levein Technologies Limited' whose director is a Sri Lankan individual. The company filings show no significant assets to make such an acquisition. - No RNS relating the GP Service - The appointment of Sharon Malka as a director of the GP Service during a period of suspension; Again no RNS - The GP Service themselves sending me an email to say they no longer have an association with Kanabo - No update on the Kanabo website, which still shows the GP Service association and a link to it - The Treat IT website references pharmacies which have no knowledge of their service - Kanabo products have been unavailable for months at any sales outlet - Avihu Tamir has stopped posting on any forum, including Linkedin, and there is no response from his email addresses - No response from my emails to their NOMAD Peterhouse Capital (and I have their director's email, who has responded once in the past) - No response from my email to their auditor MHA. They were in the news this year for audit failures, which doesn't inspire confidence https://www.cityam.com/mha-watchdog-opens-probe-over-audits-of-folded-construction-firm/ I could go on - The thing that will get this traction is personal impact stories, so I'd encourage you to share your situation with as many journalists as you can.",

I would suggest others do the same, and to as many journalists as you can find. My gut feel is that Kanabo knowingly overpaid massively for The GP Service, only to offload it back at a fraction of the cost.  Shareholder monies will have evaporated, and with it being offloaded under suspension I imagine the audit trail goes with it. The directors involved here all appear known to each other. I suspect the UK directors resigned when they suspected something was wrong, as they didn't want to be associated with it. What did Kanabo ever actually produce? In reality we've seen some cheap vapes that could have been produced in China. Even more interesting is their fraudulent listings here : https://treat-it.clinic/clinics/ I am very familiar with Southwold, and know the pharmacy well.   Last week their pharmacy was listed as a referral centre for Treat IT.   This week they've been removed.   I spoke with the pharmacy and they've never heard of Treat IT (as I suspected). I believe they are just rotating around pharmacies on that site, pretending they have a connection..........when in reality they have none.",

This is a rare chance to put your stamp on a healthcare business at exactly the right moment. You will have the backing of an experienced global group, the autonomy to lead locally, and the mandate to build something credible, compliant, and profitable from the ground up. The clinic has recently been acquired by a highly successful international telehealth group and now needs a Country General Manager who can stabilise, rebuild, and grow the operation with confidence, pace, and rigour. If you thrive in regulated environments and want the authority to shape outcomes rather than manage symptoms, this role is for you. Why this role is different True GM accountability: full P&L ownership, not just operational oversight High-impact turnaround: you will lead the reset and set the future direction Commercial freedom with guardrails: build growth that works within regulation Board-level influence: UK lead and member of the global executive team Massive market opportunity: one of the UK\u2019s fastest-evolving therapeutic areas Remote-first with real autonomy and trust What you\u2019ll be trusted to do You will be the person who brings clarity and momentum. In your first year, you will: Stabilise the business post-acquisition and restore confidence with regulators, clinicians, suppliers, and patients Shape a compliant operating model that is ready to scale Take full ownership of financial performance and drive the business to sustainable profitability Build a commercially disciplined growth engine with controlled patient acquisition costs Lead and align clinical and non-clinical teams around clear goals and accountability This is a hands-on leadership role. You will be close to the detail when needed, and firmly focused on outcomes at all times. Who this will suit You are likely already operating at senior level in healthcare, telehealth, or another tightly regulated environment. Experience in medical cannabis or like sectors is a strong advantage, but not essential. You bring: Proven experience running or turning around a regulated healthcare business Comfort owning a P&L and making commercially tough decisions The credibility to work confidently with clinicians, regulators, Boards, and investors A calm, decisive leadership style when the pressure is on A patient-first mindset paired with sharp commerci",

What happens to the Treat IT clinic ? It was powered  by the GP Service  and is still functioning? The partnership with British  Cannabis is also powered by the GP Service So if the administrators are now looking at strategic ways to save the business, will this recent disposal transaction end the support between GP Service and Treat It clinic/British Cannabis partnership? IMO the rapid disposal still looks suspicious due to the previous actions with Novimedica etc and what if any assets are still viable as a going concern and if so, what delayed accounts are now submitted to companies house after this disposal.",

From April the GP Service has  complied with the regulatory requirements at companies house with the accounts /confirmation statement to keep it running as a going concern with Sulcranie creating Novamedica platform  trading as The GP service whilst not carrying any medical liabilities possibly because the Doctors are self employed. With the Kanabo Group  IMO it looks like it has been purposely left to run into administration followed by a gaslighting Administration RNS about working alongside the administrators to look for ways to rescue the group, when in reality,in administration they have to hand over full control of the business, but does that still include the GP Service that lookss like to have been running as a solvent independent company . So the Group administration has now been registered at companies house together with late account / confirmation statement pending  whilst the GP Serviceis up to date and running. So since the temporary suspension and maybe a long time before it ,was their strategic planning aimed at protecting  the group or the gp service and their own pockets whilst screwing shareholders . If the Group survives in some capacity  and relists then we will need more than a miracle  but it looks like the GP Service has already been taken care of ,",

Novamedica is trading as The GPService but that doesn't confirm that they own the GPService UK  however IMO  the cause concern would still lie with the director and his continued relationship he has with Kanabo Group and the Gpservice UK since his resignation.How would this platform be financially beneficial to Kanabo shareholders and how would the revenue income be managed ?This relationship  may not have breached the Companies Act 2006 yet but any disposal of the GPService looks very  questionable. You mentioned  Levein Technologies and after an AI  Google search,it reveals the name The  Levein Group, and it states that Suleman and Kanabo Avihu have a relationship  (maybe partnership) with this company, so that name has not come out of thin air.

If  THE GP SERVICE is trying to be no  affiliated with Kanabo, that maybe due to their previous threat of being struck off, resulting in them now not offering medical cannabis as one of their treatments and ive also noticed the Care Quality Commission  sign missing . I would expect any asset disposal  would need  shareholders approval and at present companies house still show Avihu and Sharon are still directors of THE GP SERVICE and it is still a subsidiary of the KANABO GROUP .but I still treat that with some caution due to their delayed updates. British Cannabis store/clinic is also in the mix hence the navigation from the Kanabo store and using the same doctors as the Treat it clinic but powered by the GPSERVICE so its worth keeping an eye on. Personally I think they have left their out of date website running  whilst retail shareholders have no updates to what's really happening but anything major would still need shareholder approval as it was shareholders money that purchased the GPSERVICE.",

Thus far I've emailed : investgations@ft.com dan.mccrum@ft.com info@tcij.org  (centre for investigative journalism) If you're pondering what to write, I've highlighted some of the following : - The steady resignation of directors leading up to the suspension - The transfer of shares by Ian Mattioli last year, which would have enabled them to be sold without disclosing a director deal - The peculiar recent filing by Kanabo plc on companies house, containing amended 2023 accounts (in which they declare they forgot to submit paperwork which excludes The GP Service from statutory audit) - The posting on the GP Service website that it had been acquired by Novomedica (company# 16437130) whose director is Suleman SACRANIE. The same man who led Kanabo to acquire it for \u00a314M in 2022 - The change in posting, removing that statement, and replacing it with 'Acquired by Levein Technologies Limited' whose director is a Sri Lankan individual. The company filings show no significant assets to make such an acquisition. - No RNS relating the GP Service - The appointment of Sharon Malka as a director of the GP Service during a period of suspension; Again no RNS - The GP Service themselves sending me an email to say they no longer have an association with Kanabo - No update on the Kanabo website, which still shows the GP Service association and a link to it - The Treat IT website references pharmacies which have no knowledge of their service - Kanabo products have been unavailable for months at any sales outlet - Avihu Tamir has stopped posting on any forum, including Linkedin, and there is no response from his email addresses - No response from my emails to their NOMAD Peterhouse Capital (and I have their director's email, who has responded once in the past) - No response from my email to their auditor MHA. They were in the news this year for audit failures, which doesn't inspire confidence https://www.cityam.com/mha-watchdog-opens-probe-over-audits-of-folded-construction-firm/ I could go on - The thing that will get this traction is personal impact stories, so I'd encourage you to share your situation with as many journalists as you can.",

I would suggest others do the same, and to as many journalists as you can find. My gut feel is that Kanabo knowingly overpaid massively for The GP Service, only to offload it back at a fraction of the cost.  Shareholder monies will have evaporated, and with it being offloaded under suspension I imagine the audit trail goes with it. The directors involved here all appear known to each other. I suspect the UK directors resigned when they suspected something was wrong, as they didn't want to be associated with it. What did Kanabo ever actually produce? In reality we've seen some cheap vapes that could have been produced in China. Even more interesting is their fraudulent listings here : https://treat-it.clinic/clinics/ I am very familiar with Southwold, and know the pharmacy well.   Last week their pharmacy was listed as a referral centre for Treat IT.   This week they've been removed.   I spoke with the pharmacy and they've never heard of Treat IT (as I suspected). I believe they are just rotating around pharmacies on that site, pretending they have a connection..........when in reality they have none.",

This is a rare chance to put your stamp on a healthcare business at exactly the right moment. You will have the backing of an experienced global group, the autonomy to lead locally, and the mandate to build something credible, compliant, and profitable from the ground up. The clinic has recently been acquired by a highly successful international telehealth group and now needs a Country General Manager who can stabilise, rebuild, and grow the operation with confidence, pace, and rigour. If you thrive in regulated environments and want the authority to shape outcomes rather than manage symptoms, this role is for you. Why this role is different True GM accountability: full P&L ownership, not just operational oversight High-impact turnaround: you will lead the reset and set the future direction Commercial freedom with guardrails: build growth that works within regulation Board-level influence: UK lead and member of the global executive team Massive market opportunity: one of the UK\u2019s fastest-evolving therapeutic areas Remote-first with real autonomy and trust What you\u2019ll be trusted to do You will be the person who brings clarity and momentum. In your first year, you will: Stabilise the business post-acquisition and restore confidence with regulators, clinicians, suppliers, and patients Shape a compliant operating model that is ready to scale Take full ownership of financial performance and drive the business to sustainable profitability Build a commercially disciplined growth engine with controlled patient acquisition costs Lead and align clinical and non-clinical teams around clear goals and accountability This is a hands-on leadership role. You will be close to the detail when needed, and firmly focused on outcomes at all times. Who this will suit You are likely already operating at senior level in healthcare, telehealth, or another tightly regulated environment. Experience in medical cannabis or like sectors is a strong advantage, but not essential. You bring: Proven experience running or turning around a regulated healthcare business Comfort owning a P&L and making commercially tough decisions The credibility to work confidently with clinicians, regulators, Boards, and investors A calm, decisive leadership style when the pressure is on A patient-first mindset paired with sharp commerci",

What happens to the Treat IT clinic ? It was powered  by the GP Service  and is still functioning? The partnership with British  Cannabis is also powered by the GP Service So if the administrators are now looking at strategic ways to save the business, will this recent disposal transaction end the support between GP Service and Treat It clinic/British Cannabis partnership? IMO the rapid disposal still looks suspicious due to the previous actions with Novimedica etc and what if any assets are still viable as a going concern and if so, what delayed accounts are now submitted to companies house after this disposal.",

From April the GP Service has  complied with the regulatory requirements at companies house with the accounts /confirmation statement to keep it running as a going concern with Sulcranie creating Novamedica platform  trading as The GP service whilst not carrying any medical liabilities possibly because the Doctors are self employed. With the Kanabo Group  IMO it looks like it has been purposely left to run into administration followed by a gaslighting Administration RNS about working alongside the administrators to look for ways to rescue the group, when in reality,in administration they have to hand over full control of the business, but does that still include the GP Service that lookss like to have been running as a solvent independent company . So the Group administration has now been registered at companies house together with late account / confirmation statement pending  whilst the GP Serviceis up to date and running. So since the temporary suspension and maybe a long time before it ,was their strategic planning aimed at protecting  the group or the gp service and their own pockets whilst screwing shareholders . If the Group survives in some capacity  and relists then we will need more than a miracle  but it looks like the GP Service has already been taken care of ,",
