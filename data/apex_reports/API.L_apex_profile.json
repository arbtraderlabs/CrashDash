One Redeemable Bonus Share will be issued for each ordinary share in the Company and shall be repurchased for 3 pence per Redeemable Bonus Share (the \u201cReturn of Capital\u201d).\nThe timetable for the Return of Capital is as follows:\nEx-Dividend Date - 6 November 2025Record Date - 6.00 p.m. on 7 November 2025\nExpected redemption and cancellation of Redeemable Bonus Shares - 10 November 2025\nPayment Date - 13 November 2025\nRedemption price per Redeemable Bonus Share - 3.0p\nFinal PID\nAs detailed in the Company\u2019s Interim Results for the period to 30 June 2025, a consequence of the Company exiting the REIT regime in November 2024 was that it was required to distribute 100% of the accumulated income profits of the Group\u2019s UK property rental business (\u201cProperty Income\u201d). An interim PID of 3p was made in January. The Board are now pleased to announce that the final PID due to shareholders is 0.92127467p.\nEx-Dividend Date - 23 October 2025Record Date - 24 October 2025\nPayment Date - 13 November 2025\nDividend per Share - 0.\n92127467\np\nAll Enquiries:\nThe Company SecretaryNorthern Trust International Fund Administration Services (Guernsey) Limited\nPO Box 255\nTrafalgar Court\nLes Banques\nSt Peter Port\nGuernsey\nGY1 3QL\nTel: 01481 745001",

Company operating costs for the period have been funded by interest from the money market investment and a gain arising from the various handover processes referred to above on disposal of aPH. This gain is explained in note 8 to the accounts.\nFar Ralia\nThe tree planting programme and associated works have been completed at Far Ralia, with a scheduled \u201cbeating up\u201d exercise undertaken in August where failed saplings were replaced.\nDespite unfavourable weather conditions during the year, the failure rate was below expectations and well within the Company\u2019s capital expenditure forecasts.\nWe also expect to receive the \u00a31.65m grant funding from Scottish Forestry (see Note 9).\nIt had been anticipated that this would have been received before now, but the process to transfer the funding contracts following the sale of aPH has been frustratingly slow.\nIn the meantime, the Company has continued to market its interest in the land at Far Ralia.\nOriginally acquired as a natural capital investment to aid the Company in offsetting its own carbon emissions, a disposal hadn\u2019t been anticipated at this point in the asset life cycle.\nForestry or natural capital buyers tend to prefer to acquire assets where the trees are more established as the risk of failure is reduced.\nAdditionally, the increased cost of capital, driven by higher, longer-term risk-free rates, has resulted in some buyers, particularly institutional investors, postponing purchases or not bidding with as much conviction as they might have 2 or 3 years ago.\nThis, in addition to the early-stage nature of the investment, has meant that interest from potential buyers has been limited. The fall in the value of Far Ralia reflects these factors as well as the reduction over the period in carbon pricing\nThe Investment Manager continues to monitor the marketing process and is preparing to implement a change in strategy to reinvigorate market interest.\nThe Board will endeavour to keep shareholders updated on progress with the sale.\nHowever, given the sensitivity and confidentiality that usually surrounds corporate property transactions, the Board may be restricted on what can be announced and when.\nREIT Status\nThe Company exited the REIT regime on completion of the sale of aPH in\nNovember 2024\n.\nHowever, it is still required to distribute 100% of the accumulated income profits of t",

This was due to a lower forecast carbon unit price and an increase in the discount rate, both reflecting a less positive background to the carbon market.\n\u00b7\nThe reduction in the value of Far Ralia resulted in a decline of 0.52p in the NAV over the period, offset by 0.1p net increase from other items.\n\u00b7\nThe NAV is prepared on a non-going concern basis which includes the estimated costs of realising Far Ralia, but does not accrue for future operating costs.\n\u00b7\nAs previously communicated, the final net proceeds of the sale to GoldenTree Asset Management are subject to normal adjustments including those\narising from the completion process\n. The areas being actively resolved involve final handovers between the appointed managing agents, particularly with respect to historic service charge recoveries and outstanding rents.\n\u00b7\nThe Investment Manager is actively monitoring the completion process for any liabilities accruing or possible balancing credits due back to the Company. It is believed that most material adjusting items have now been identified and included in the NAV.\nFar Ralia Sale Process\nThe Investment Manager continues to market the sole remaining property via their appointed agent. The Board and Manager had hoped to have disposed of Far Ralia in the first half of the year. While several discussions have taken place with interested parties, given the unique nature of the property and a relatively narrow set of potential purchasers, it is difficult to estimate when, and at what value, the property will be sold.\nNet income and expenses\nThe Company holds approximately \u00a319.3m in cash. Cash is held in a money market fund currently yielding above 4.0%. At present, the interest being earned on the cash balance is approximately equal to running expenses of the Company. There is likely to be a small amount of ongoing capital expenditure on Far Ralia (some of which may be recoverable through grants) although all the significant capital expenditure has been undertaken. An estimate of grant funding due to the Company from the Scottish Government for past capex of \u00a31.6 million is reflected in the\n30 June 2025\nNAV.\nDistributions\nAs noted above, the Investment Manager is currently actively monitoring the remaining final handovers between the appointed managing agents. Once finalised, it will be possible for the Board to determine the final Property Income Distribution to be paid to shareholders and the Company will make an announcement at that time. The Board also anticipate making a prudent interim capital distribution at the same time.\nNet Asset Value\nThe unaudited NAV per ordinary share as at\n30 June 2025\nwas 7.45p. The net asset value is calculated under International Financial Reporting Standards as amended for the Company operating on a non-going concern basis.\nThe net asset value incorporates the external portfolio valuation by Knight Frank LLP at\n30 June 2025\nof \u00a38.0 million (\nDecember 24\n- \u00a310 million)\nBreakdown of NAV movement\nSet out below is a breakdown of the change in the unaudited NAV over the period from\n31 December 2024\nto\n30 June 2025\n.\nPer Share (p)\nAttributable Assets (\u00a3m)\n% Opening NAV\nComment\nNet assets as at 31 December 2024\n7.96\n30.4\n100.0\nUnrealised movement in valuation of property portfolio (including impairment)\n(0.52)\n(2.0)\n(6.6)\nRealised Gain on sale\n0.06\n0.2\n0.7\nAdjustment to estimated costs of disposal of portfolio\n0.01\n0.0\n0.1\nThe estimated costs of selling the remaining asset have been reduced.\nCAPEX in the period\n(0.06)\n(0.2)\n(0.6)\nNet income in the period\n0.00\n0.0\n0.0\nNet assets as at 30 June 2025\n7.45\n28.4\n93.6\nThe Net Asset Value per share is calculated using 381,218,977 shares of 1p each being the number in issue on\n30 June 2025\n.\nNet Asset analysis as at\n30 June 2025\n(unaudited)\n\u00a3m\n% of net assets\nLand\n8.0\n28.2\nTotal Portfolio\n8.0\n28.2\nEstimated costs of disposal\n(0.1)\n(0.5)\nFair value of Portfolio\n7.9\n27.7\nCash\n19.3\n67.8\nTrade Debtors (Net of provisioning)\n0.2\n0.8\nOther Assets\n2.1\n7.4\nTotal Assets\n29.5\n103.7\nCurrent liabilities\n(1.1)\n(3.7)\nTotal Net Assets\n28.4\n100.0\nExcept as described above, the Board is not aware of any significant property events or transactions which have occurred between\n30 June 2025\nand",

I still hold, but regret not fully exiting when the deal collapsed. Will top up, but 46p is my absolute top. The BoD could also cut or eliminate quarterly dividends while this goes on. Its no longer a nice guaranteed revenue stream. If that happens I expect more like 40p as the bottom. Let's see.",

The dividend is a PID dividend of 3p so subject to 20% withholding tax if paid outside ISE or SIPP, the ex-dividend date is 19 Dec paid on or around 24 Dec paid on 10 Jan. On the 20 Dec I would expect the SP to reduce by around 55p. The rest of the money will follow in 1 or more payments at some date in the future only after all the other assets are sold i.e. Far Ralia and all costs are paid, this is likely to be a capital return so subject CTG.",

This is a low liquidity share normally, with low daily traded volumes. When the shorters added 6% of liquidity its not surprising the price crashed to bargain levels.

Urban Logistics approached the Abrdn trust with an all-share offer which valued the latter at 59.2p on the day of the announcement, a 23% premium to its undisturbed share price the day before the Custodian deal was made public and a 13% premium to the Custodian offer. Urban Logistics claims the two are a good fit as only 9% of the combined portfolio would be outside of logistics and retail warehousing, in addition to which it knows the API assets well.\" \"Despite this commercial logic, convincing API shareholders may be another matter as over a quarter of the shares are owned by retail investors who appreciate the 7.7% yield and quarterly dividend payments, whereas Urban Logistics has a lower yield and pays a semi-annual dividend. Also, 9% of API\u2019s shares are held by wealth management firm Mattioli Woods (MTW), which happens to own Custodian Capital Ltd, the manager of the Custodian REIT, and would presumably rather see the latter take control.\"",

Nice to see us getting a bit of value back in the share price. \"Pursuant to Rule 2.6(d) and Section 4 of Appendix 7 of the Takeover Code, the Panel Executive has ruled that, unless the Executive consents otherwise, Urban Logistics must by 5.00pm on 13 March 2024, being the seventh day prior to the date of the Adjourned Meetings, either announce a firm intention to make an offer for API under Rule 2.7 of the Code or announce that it does not intend to make an offer for API. This deadline will cease to apply if, before that time, a third party other than Urban Logistics has announced a firm intention to make an offer for API under Rule 2.7. Each of API, CREI and Urban Logistics has accepted this ruling.\"",

Interesting that they feel a managed wind-down would be preferable to either of the SHED proposals.

More information on this process will be set out in due course.\" In my experience of other managed wind downs, they dont deliver the value expected  and take a lot longer than anticipated with a rump of assets that they cant shift.   I'd rather just keep going as is and sell when theres value than try and wind down at the bottom of the property market. Feels like it will drift back to the 40's where it started",

I still hold, but regret not fully exiting when the deal collapsed. Will top up, but 46p is my absolute top. The BoD could also cut or eliminate quarterly dividends while this goes on. Its no longer a nice guaranteed revenue stream. If that happens I expect more like 40p as the bottom. Let's see.",

The dividend is a PID dividend of 3p so subject to 20% withholding tax if paid outside ISE or SIPP, the ex-dividend date is 19 Dec paid on or around 24 Dec paid on 10 Jan. On the 20 Dec I would expect the SP to reduce by around 55p. The rest of the money will follow in 1 or more payments at some date in the future only after all the other assets are sold i.e. Far Ralia and all costs are paid, this is likely to be a capital return so subject CTG.",

The little relief with most of my high yielding ITs/REITs falling are more winddowns so at least some chance to make a bit of cash from the falling market. Such a turn around from a few years ago when REITs/ITs at a premium to NAV and were raising funds on the market, would buy in on the fund raise and sell all or most a few months after when the price recovered leaving just my core holdings.",

The dividend is a PID dividend of 3p so subject to 20% withholding tax if paid outside ISE or SIPP, the ex-dividend date is 19 Dec paid on or around 24 Dec paid on 10 Jan.

I still hold, but regret not fully exiting when the deal collapsed. Will top up, but 46p is my absolute top. The BoD could also cut or eliminate quarterly dividends while this goes on.

Thinking now we may see 65p or over if we are very lucky IMO. Look at CREI go this morning, against a backdrop of other REITs falling today. The value in the offer was far greater IMO. Reduced this morning. Overall I'm OK as made a nice return on CREI and I also still hold both so lower risk for me than before the offer. Still unhappy though.",

The dividend is a PID dividend of 3p so subject to 20% withholding tax if paid outside ISE or SIPP, the ex-dividend date is 19 Dec paid on or around 24 Dec paid on 10 Jan.

Either that or they were gullable and believed the shorters narrative about a bumper payout by rejecting the deal. It's just left this share vulnerable to the vultures, as predicted. I still hold, but regret not fully exiting when the deal collapsed. Will top up, but 46p is my absolute top. The BoD could also cut or eliminate quarterly dividends while this goes on. Its no longer a nice guaranteed revenue stream. If that happens I expect more like 40p as the bottom. Let's see.",

Such a turn around from a few years ago when REITs/ITs at a premium to NAV and were raising funds on the market, would buy in on the fund raise and sell all or most a few months after when the price recovered leaving just my core holdings.",

The dividend is a PID dividend of 3p so subject to 20% withholding tax if paid outside ISE or SIPP, the ex-dividend date is 19 Dec paid on or around 24 Dec paid on 10 Jan.

I still hold, but regret not fully exiting when the deal collapsed. Will top up, but 46p is my absolute top. The BoD could also cut or eliminate quarterly dividends while this goes on. Its no longer a nice guaranteed revenue stream. If that happens I expect more like 40p as the bottom. Let's see.",

The dividend is a PID dividend of 3p so subject to 20% withholding tax if paid outside ISE or SIPP, the ex-dividend date is 19 Dec paid on or around 24 Dec paid on 10 Jan. On the 20 Dec I would expect the SP to reduce by around 55p. The rest of the money will follow in 1 or more payments at some date in the future only after all the other assets are sold i.e. Far Ralia and all costs are paid, this is likely to be a capital return so subject CTG.",

I still hold, but regret not fully exiting when the deal collapsed. Will top up, but 46p is my absolute top. The BoD could also cut or eliminate quarterly dividends while this goes on. Its no longer a nice guaranteed revenue stream. If that happens I expect more like 40p as the bottom. Let's see.",

Tomorrow, the shares will also be trading ex-dividend so you can expect another c. 3p drop, but you will receive a dividend payment of 3p per share in January if you are a holder.

The dividend is a PID dividend of 3p so subject to 20% withholding tax if paid outside ISE or SIPP, the ex-dividend date is 19 Dec paid on or around 24 Dec paid on 10 Jan. On the 20 Dec I would expect the SP to reduce by around 55p. The rest of the money will follow in 1 or more payments at some date in the future only after all the other assets are sold i.e. Far Ralia and all costs are paid, this is likely to be a capital return so subject CTG.",

I still hold, but regret not fully exiting when the deal collapsed. Will top up, but 46p is my absolute top. The BoD could also cut or eliminate quarterly dividends while this goes on. Its no longer a nice guaranteed revenue stream. If that happens I expect more like 40p as the bottom. Let's see.",

May also buy some more API if it goes below 6p, should get a good return but may have to wait a time, still waiting for the last drips from EPIC after  quite a time but virtually all funds returned and seen a nice profit. Would like to top up on other REITs like SUPR and SHED at these high yields and high discount to NAV but losing confidence as constant falling SPs due this Governments higher Interest rate for longer and drive the country into recession polices. The little relief with most of my high yielding ITs/REITs falling are more winddowns so at least some chance to make a bit of cash from the falling market. Such a turn around from a few years ago when REITs/ITs at a premium to NAV and were raising funds on the market, would buy in on the fund raise and sell all or most a few months after when the price recovered leaving just my core holdings.",
