      "Zero ATR and StdDev 20d = 0.0000 implies no price movement for at least the past 20 days, a classic sign of a dead ticker or a stock that has been suspended.",
      "The crash bottom drawdown of 96.7% from peak combined with an entry price of 0.00p creates a mathematically impossible situation unless the price was rounded to zero after a collapse; this hints at a data entry or reporting glitch.",
      "The Google Trends signal \u2018DEAD_TICKER\u2019 with an interpretation of \u2018Dead_ticker - UP\u2019 indicates that the algorithm is flagging a dead ticker but simultaneously detecting a short\u2011term upward trend, likely due to a single automated trade or bot activity."

      "Google Trends momentum (+76%) contradicts the complete absence of trading and sentiment data; if a legitimate news event were to surface (e.g., relisting, regulatory approval), the price could spike dramatically from 0.00p, offering a contrarian upside.",

    ],
    "risk_warnings": [
      "Delisting or suspension risk: zero activity and zero volatility strongly suggest the stock may no longer trade on the AIM.",
      "Liquidity risk: with no trading volume, any attempt to buy or sell would be impossible and could result in price manipulation or loss of capital.",
      "Data integrity risk: the 0.00p entry price and zero volatility metrics may reflect a reporting error rather than a true market state."
    ],
    "opportunity_flags": [
      "Monitor for any regulatory filing or company announcement that could trigger a relisting or price reset; a sudden jump from 0.00p could yield high returns if liquidity returns.",
      "If a small institutional or high\u2011frequency trader identifies a price floor at 0.00p, there is a theoretical arbitrage opportunity, but only if the stock is still listed and trading.",

    "narrative_summary": "API.L appears to be a dead ticker with no trading, no news, and zero volatility, yet Google Trends shows anomalous upward momentum\u2014likely noise. The lack of institutional activity and the 0.00p price point point to delisting or data error. While a contrarian spike could exist if the company relists, the liquidity and regulatory risks make the stock unattractive for most investors."
