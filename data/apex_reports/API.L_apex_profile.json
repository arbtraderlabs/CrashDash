      "Zero ATR and StdDev coupled with a massive drawdown is a classic signature of a stock that has stopped trading and is likely to be delisted.",

      "The \"dead_ticker \u2013 UP\" interpretation implies that the classification system expects a reversal; this could be a warning that the company is about to reactivate its shares (reverse split, re\u2011listing, or acquisition)."

      "A +36% Google Trends momentum on a ticker that has no price or volatility is a contrarian cue that the market is starting to pay attention to a previously ignored asset.",
