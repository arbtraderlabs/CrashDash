While the lack of RNS, social sentiment, and liquidity signals a high risk of delisting, the contradictory positive momentum suggests a hidden opportunity for a price jump if the company restructures or re\u2011lists. Investors should treat the situation as a high\u2011risk, high\u2011reward scenario, monitoring for any formal announcement that could unlock the share price."
