      "bear_case": "The company has zero sales, zero price movement, and no social or search interest. The only positive news is a partnership that has yet to translate into revenue or orders. Without a clear funding event or revenue confirmation, the stock remains a speculative lottery.",

      "if_watching": "Hold a watchlist slot. Monitor AGM outcomes, any PDMR filings, and signs of a capital raise. If the company announces a funding round or first order, evaluate the terms before committing.",
