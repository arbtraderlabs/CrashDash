The information is disclosed in accordance with the Company's obligations under Article 17 of UK MAR. Upon the publication of this announcement, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nCeres Power Holdings plc\nWeichai signs manufacturing licence for SOFC power\nCeres Power Holdings plc\n(\"Ceres\" or the \"Company\")\n(CWR.L), a leading developer of clean energy technology, has signed a manufacturing licence agreement for the production of Ceres' proprietary solid oxide fuel cell (\"SOFC\") technology with Weichai Power (\"Weichai\"), a global original equipment manufacturer (\"OEM\") and power systems developer headquartered in Shandong, China.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nBuilds upon a strong, existing commercial relationship with Weichai -\nWeichai will now manufacture cells and stacks for their stationary power systems. This agreement supersedes existing agreements with Weichai.\n\u00b7\nFurther expands Ceres global manufacturing partner portfolio\nto four.\n\u00b7\nSignificant revenue and cash generation\n- licence fees, milestones and royalties\nare consistent with previous Ceres manufacturing licensing agreements.\nWeichai intends to establish a manufacturing facility to produce cells and stacks for the stationary power markets supported by key components supplied from Ceres\n, targeting power for AI data centres, commercial buildings and industrial applications. SOFC systems will complement Weichai's existing product portfolio for power generation, including gas engines and powertrains.\nGiven the timing of the agreement, revenue recognition for the licence fees are likely to be booked in FY26 so 2025 Group revenues will remain as previously guided.\nCommenting on the new partnership Phil Caldwell, CEO of Ceres, said\n: \"\nWe are excited to extend our relationship with Weichai with a manufacturing licence to produce Ceres-based products in China, further expanding the ecosystem for our technology. Our relationship with Weichai, a leading supplier of conventional gas engines in China and internationally, represents both an endorsement of Ceres technology and a significant business opportunity for both companies.\n\"There is now an acute need for power systems to service AI data centres, industrial power needs, grid reinforcement and commercial buildings. Adding Ceres' high efficiency SOFC that can be deployed where the power is needed at pace represents a multi-billion market opportunity and continues our mission to establish Ceres as the industry standard solid oxide technology.\"\nEnds\nFor further information visit\nwww.ceres.tech\nor contact:\nCeres Power Holdings plc\nPatrick Yau/Merryl Black\nTel: +44 (0)7884 654179\nEmail: investors@cerespower.com\nMHP Group (PR Adviser)\nReg Hoare/James McFarlane/Matthew Taylor\nTel: +44 (0)7831 406117\nEmail:\nceres@mhpgroup.com\nAbout Ceres\nCeres is a leading developer of clean energy technology: fuel cells for power generation and electrolysers to produce green hydrogen.

The information is disclosed in accordance with the Company's obligations under Article 17 of UK MAR. Upon the publication of this announcement, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nCeres Power Holdings plc\nInterim results for the six months ended 30 June 2025\nCeres Power Holdings plc (\"Ceres\", the \"Company\") (CWR.L), a leading developer of clean energy technology, announces its results for the six-month period ended 30 June 2025.\nFinancial highlights\n\u00b7\nStrong balance sheet with cash and short-term investments of \u00a3104.1 million (December 2024: \u00a3102.5 million), following positive cash inflow of \u00a31.6 million (H1 2024: outflow of \u00a313.9 million) received in the period as a result of disciplined working capital management\n\u00b7\nRevenue decreased 26% to \u00a321.1 million (H1 2024: \u00a328.5 million), in line with management expectations following significant one-off licence revenue as part of the Delta agreement in 2024\n\u00b7\nGross profit decreased 27% to \u00a316.6 million (H1 2024: \u00a322.9 million), reflecting lower revenues in the period\n\u00b7\nGross margin of 79% (H1 2024: 80%)\n\u00b7\nOperating costs (before exceptional costs) decreased by 6% to \u00a335.6 million (H1 2024: \u00a337.9 million) following the cost base rationalisation announced in 2024 and continued financial discipline\n\u00b7\nAdjusted EBITDA loss increased to \u00a311.3 million (H1 2024: \u00a39.0 million)\nCommercial highlights year to date\n\u00b7\nDoosan factory starts cell and stack production\n: In July 2025 Doosan became the first Ceres partner to enter mass production of products using Ceres solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) technology. Exciting growth applications include AI-driven data centre power, energy grid stabilisation, power systems for buildings and auxiliary power for marine. The royalty revenue streams due to Ceres will follow Doosan's first commercial sales\n\u00b7\nShell megawatt-scale electrolyser goes live:\nfirst hydrogen production at Shell's Technology Centre in Bangalore demonstrating an industry-leading electrolyser module efficiency of 37kWh/kg of hydrogen\n\u00b7\nDelta acquires land and factory facilities\n: Delta has committed approximately NT$6.95 billion (c. \u00a3170 million) on assets for the large-scale manufacturing of hydrogen energy solutions, including on Ceres' solid oxide technology, for AI-driven\ndata centre power\n, microgrid and other\nenergy infrastructure applications\n\u00b7\nThermax and Denso relationships\n: Thermax has inaugurated its HydroGenx Hub in Pune, India to evaluate and demonstrate green hydrogen technologies and SOEC systems. Denso is also making good progress, passing technology transfer key milestones\n\u00b7\nBusiness transformation\n: Ceres is announcing a business transformation programme to recognise its transition from a R&D focussed to a commercially led organisation.\nOutlook\n\u00b7\nThe Board now believes that the most probable revenue outturn for the year ending 31 December 2025 will be around \u00a332 million. The Company is in later stage negotiation regarding a new manufacturing licence agreement but recognises that completion and timing of revenue recognition are uncertain. If successful, any revenue recognised in the current year would be in addition to the above guidance.\nPhil Caldwell, Chief Executive Officer of Ceres, said:\n\"We are seeing an unprecedented change in the market with an acute need for power to service the demand of AI-data centres and increased electrification of society which represents a major market opportunity for the business. The emergence of this market has coincided with Doosan's start of mass manufacture of Ceres-based products and marks a key inflection point as we transition from being an R&D-led organisation to a commercially focused business.\nWe have to adapt to the changing market opportunities and we are implementing a business transformation programme to ensure we are in the best shape to drive the next exciting phase of the Company's growth.\nWith a single product approach, a sharper commercial and operational focus and the establishment of mass manufacturing, I am confident that we can both meet the needs of today's rapidly growing power market while also positioning the business for the future hydrogen market which we believe will follow over the coming years.\"\nEnds\nFinancial Summary\n30 June 2025\n30 June 2024\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nTotal revenue, comprising:\n21,093\n28,500\nProvision of technology hardware\n6,579\n3,209\nEngineering services and licences\n14,514\n25,291\nGross profit\n16,622\n22,887\nGross margin %\n79%\n80%\nAdjusted EBITDA loss1\n(11,311)\n(9,042)\nOperating loss (before exceptional costs)\n(17,217)\n(13,757)\nNet cash generated/(used) in operating activi",

Doosan Fuel Cell will manufacture the stacks and fuel cell power systems at its dedicated factory in South Korea with the ability to produce a combined generational capacity of 50MW of electrical power each year.\nThis commencement of manufacturing marks a significant milestone for Ceres, as Doosan is the first of its strategic licensing partners to enter mass production using its technology. The fuel cells, stacks\nand\npower systems\nthat Doosan Fuel Cell produces will be marketed initially to customers in South Korea.\nThe Ceres\ndesigned fuel cells will be manufactured in Doosan\nFuel Cell's\nstate-of-the-art factory in the province of\nJeollabuk-do, South Korea, where construction began in 2022. Its completion marks the world's first Ceres metal supported solid oxide fuel cell and systems facility to come on-stream. Doosan\nFuel Cell\nanticipates the sale of its first solid oxide fuel cell products will occur before the end of 2025.\nDoosan\nFuel Cell\nwill distribute the solid oxide systems, with a primary market focus on applications for stationary distributed power. These include data centres, where the advent of AI processing has caused a spike in power demand that can be met by the deployment of fuel cells. Other uses include the stabilisation of renewables-based power grids and microgrids through peak power production, power systems for buildings, and auxiliary power solutions for marine shipping markets.\nPhil Caldwell, C\nhief Executive Officer of Ceres said:\n\"Fuel cells have a\nmajor part to play in meeting the world's rapidly-increasing power demands, developing energy resilience and ensuring decarbonisation. Ceres' solid oxide design is the ideal technology for these applications through its higher efficiency, lower cost and greater robustness than other technologies. Doosan\nFuel Cell's\ncommencement of mass manufacturing is a major step in bringing this technology to the world.\"\nDoosoon Lee\n, C\nhief Executive Officer of\nDoosan Fuel Cell\nsaid:\n\"Fuel cells, a clean energy solution, are gaining attention as an optimal alternative to various power demands triggered by AI, including data centres. In South Korea, the world's leading fuel cell market, we aim to lead the adoption of advanced SOFCs by leveraging our collaboration with Ceres. By commercialising these technologies and promoting their domestic production, we intend to spearhead the acceleration of the global transition to a decarbonised society through eco-friendly energy solutions in the commercial power market and maritime mobility.\"\nEnds\nFor further information visit\nwww.ceres.tech\nor contact:\nCeres Power Holdings plc\nPatrick Yau/ Merryl Black\nTel: +44 (0)7884 654179\nEmail:\ninvestors@cerespower.com\nMHP Group (PR Adviser)\nReg Hoare/James McFarlane/Matthew Taylor\nTel: +44 (0) 7827 662831\nEmail:\nceres@mhpgroup.com\nAbout Ceres\nCeres is a leading developer of clean energy technology: fuel cells for power generation and electrolysers for the production of green hydrogen.

This milestone marks a\nn\nimportant\nstep, demonstrating the first megawatt-scale SOEC system in India and the maturity of Ceres' solid oxide electrolyser technology,\nsupported by Shell's installation, integration and safety assurance expertise.\nShell and Ceres have been in collaboration since 202\n2, leading to the deployment of the megawatt-scale electrolyser\nwith the potential to produce hydrogen at 600 kg per day at full capacity with an electrolyser module efficiency of 37kWh/kg H2. The metal supported design from Ceres allows it to operate at lower temperatures than current state of the art SOEC technology. The operational phase of the demonstrator is expected to show how this brings robustness and lower operational costs.\nThe start of hydrogen production by this demonstrator system marks the beginning of the operational phase of this project, with data and learnings used to develop a commercially competitive and scalable solution for industrial processes.\nP\nhil Caldwell, Chief Executive of Ceres, commented:\n\"This achievement illustrates how Ceres' high efficiency technology can scale to meet the needs of industry and deliver a route to economically viable hydrogen for green steel, ammonia and synthetic fuels. India has ambitious plans, targeting development of green hydrogen production capacity of at least five million metric tons per year by 2030\n[1]\nand technological advancements, just like the one we have announced today, are aiming to contribute to this goal by helping to build and galvanise India's clean energy ecosystem.\"\nTheo Bodewes, General Manager of Hydrogen at Shell Projects & Technology said:\n\"Hydrogen has a huge role to play in\na low-carbon energy system\nas a feedstock for low carbon gases and low carbon fuels.\nW\ne are\nworking with Ceres to\nhelp advance technologies that can deliver hydrogen efficiently\nand\nreliably\n.\nThis latest\nmilestone is the next stage in helping us to learn and evaluate the best approach to\nproducing\nlower\n-\ncost electrolysed hydrogen.

The Company also provides a further post period-end trading update.\nAt its interims on 27 September 2024, the Company guided to full year revenues in the range of \u00a350-60 million. This guidance range was refined to \u00a355-60 million with a gross margin of 78-80% when the Company reported its trading update for the year to 31 December 2024 on 29 January 2025.\nAs we finalise the audit, there is some uncertainty over whether a single \u00a35 million contracted milestone payment should be recognised in 2024 or whether it is more appropriate to recognise it in 2025. This recognition date does not impact the total revenue recognised under the contract or the cash position of the company. To remove any uncertainty, and whilst the Company is working to clarify the correct accounting treatment under IFRS 15, Ceres is reverting to the original revenue guidance of \u00a350-60 million and confirms that its gross margin will be over 75% for the year.\nThe management team will be hosting a live webcast for analysts and investors on 21 March 2025 at 09.30 GMT.

Ceres has successfully completed the upfront technology transfer to Denso Corporation following its licence agreement in July.\n\u00b7\nIndia - SOEC commercialisation with Thermax underway\n. Using Ceres' intellectual property,\nThermax has begun developing assembly facility layouts\nto accelerate market entry.\n\u00b7\nSouth Korea - Doosan production on track\n. Doosan factory commissioning for SOFC stack and cell production is progressing towards commercial launch, which is expected in H2 2025.\n\u00b7\nOngoing partnerships.\nBosch, Weichai and Shell continue to progress with key product milestones achieved in 2024 including new higher power stack and system development.\nPhil Caldwell, Chief Executive Officer of Ceres commented,\n\"2024 was an exciting year for Ceres as we accelerated our commercial delivery with two new major manufacturing licensees and continue to establish Ceres as the industry standard through the adoption of our technology globally. Alongside our first electrolyser partnerships, we now see increased opportunities for our power technology resulting from the rising energy demand from AI data centres and the strain on power grids from increased electrification.\nThe anticipated launch of first power system products through our partner Doosan in late 2025 will mark a major milestone with the delivery of our first royalties. As our technology becomes deployed at scale, we are positioned to drive decarbonisation across a number of sectors globally. With a strong cash position and commercial momentum, Ceres is well positioned for the years ahead.\"\nEnds\nFor further information visit\nwww.ceres.tech\nor contact:\nCeres Power Holdings plc\nPatrick Yau/Merryl Black\nTel: +44(0)7884 654 179\nEmail:\ninvestors@cerespower.com\nMHP Group (PR Advisor)\nReg Hoare/James McFarlane\nTel: +44 (0)203 727 1000\nEmail:\nceres@mhpgroup.com\nAbout Ceres\nCeres is a leading developer of clean energy technology: electrolysis for the production of green hydrogen and fuel cells for power generation.

Watch carefully and wait is my own approach, accepting that you can't always time it right.

Each time, I look for a 4.5% profit and then decide whether to sell (or buy) .  I buy or sell too soon at times and have to wait for the next trend reversal. Sometimes only days, other times months but have not yet taken a cash loss. At present stock price I'm up around 6% on the \u00a350k holding I bought about six or eight weeks ago but up more than 25% over the last 12 months by watching, waiting,  and constantly evaluating the changing trend and then trading in or out as my research(and gut feeling) dictates. Overall, I have great faith in CWR as an investment, and I would not want to be in cash for long at present. Overall I think that the chance of an upward explosion in the share price is greater than a sudden lurch downward. As always, you \"pays your money and takes your chance\"!",

That positioning gives us a genuine technological and commercial 'neutrality' that is highly attractive to current and future licensees. Were one of our licensees to buy Ceres, that neutrality is void, no matter how many 'nice' statements the new owner might make.  That would be the beginning of the end for Ceres and an open invitation to the other licensees to rip off the technology, or diversify away from Ceres. Ceres is often spoken of as being an intellectual property company in the same model as ARM (in semi-conductors) Does anyone remember when NVIDIA tried to buy ARM before it floated on  NASDAQ?  The reaction from ARM's other customers e.g. Apple, put an end to that idea damn quick, and they floated. Why will Ceres not be taken over by one of our licensees? Because it would destroy the business model on which Ceres success is based.",

SOFC can of course use either, and turbines are well down that duel fuel path too. Gas is widely,  and cheaply, available across most of the US and that is what the Bloom kit for data centres will be using. There is now a politically tricky issue arising in the US around this issue.  Essentially, power companies are jacking up the cost of electricity to domestic customers in areas where new data centre are being built.  Hence operators who build their own power supply (turbine if you can find one, or fuel cell) will get planning permits.  Others will not. Loads of customers for a US based Ceres partner.  I cannot believe we are not is discussions with some US companies.",

My observation re short sellers and the way their game can play out comes from experience that has proven costly in the past, I don\u2019t believe a short seller won\u2019t take a second and third bite of the cherry when the opportunity arises to cast doubt on the value of a business.

(NYSE:BE) stock is gaining attention after RBC Capital reiterated its Outperform rating and $143.00 price target on the fuel cell manufacturer. The stock currently trades at $151, slightly above the target, after delivering an impressive 525% return over the past year. The reiteration follows the discovery of an air permit filing that indicates Bloom Energy fuel cells will power a 1.5 GW datacenter in Navarro County, Texas. The permit, filed by Hedgehog USA on December 29, 2025, details plans to use 4,615 Bloom Energy servers for electricity generation at a \"purpose-built, off-grid energy & data center.\" According to the filing, construction is scheduled to begin in August 2026, with the first phase starting with a 104 MW behind-the-meter solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) foundation before expanding to 300 MW, then to 800 MW and beyond. RBC Capital views this development as \"another proof point that BE\u2019s fuel cells are being broadly adopted by datacenters at scale\" and highlights the company\u2019s behind-the-meter opportunity in the datacenter market. Investors should note that Bloom Energy will report its next quarterly earnings on February 5, with analysts expecting continued revenue growth.",

I see that Meta  have just sighted power supply contracts with nuclear providers.  Given the volume of natural gas available across the US, fuel cells must be a cheaper option. As I understand it, all large scale gas turbine capacity is sold out over the next three years and it will take a number of years to meaningfully increase that capacity.  Given this would be our fifth/sixth SOFC partner, Ceres should now be able to accelerate the whole transfer process to enable a fast track implementation.  Given the size of the orders Bloom have win, there is a hugely attractive opportunity there.",

Banking a profit anytime I could have 4% or more. Then simply reinvesting the original \u00a350K whenever the sp appeared (to me) to be weakening. Overall my current \u00a350k holding stands me in at an average of 1.52 a share. I believe the current run has good momentum. I will keep holding, watching, and waiting for a while before selling and subsequently buying back in (temporarily) when the weak phase reappears. I do suspect that the \u00a33 + mark is on the cards fairly soon now. However, Messrs Putin, Trump, Khomeni and Netanyahu between them could upset the whole apple cart at very short notice, so one needs a personal stop loss escape policy in these turbulent times.",

Each time, I look for a 4.5% profit and then decide whether to sell (or buy) .  I buy or sell too soon at times and have to wait for the next trend reversal. Sometimes only days, other times months but have not yet taken a cash loss. At present stock price I'm up around 6% on the \u00a350k holding I bought about six or eight weeks ago but up more than 25% over the last 12 months by watching, waiting,  and constantly evaluating the changing trend and then trading in or out as my research(and gut feeling) dictates. Overall, I have great faith in CWR as an investment, and I would not want to be in cash for long at present. Overall I think that the chance of an upward explosion in the share price is greater than a sudden lurch downward. As always, you \"pays your money and takes your chance\"!",

The benefits of Ceres ongoing development is open to all of our licensees. We do not sell production models of our kit to anyone. Hence, we NEVER compete with our licensees. That positioning gives us a genuine technological and commercial 'neutrality' that is highly attractive to current and future licensees. Were one of our licensees to buy Ceres, that neutrality is void, no matter how many 'nice' statements the new owner might make.  That would be the beginning of the end for Ceres and an open invitation to the other licensees to rip off the technology, or diversify away from Ceres. Ceres is often spoken of as being an intellectual property company in the same model as ARM (in semi-conductors) Does anyone remember when NVIDIA tried to buy ARM before it floated on  NASDAQ?  The reaction from ARM's other customers e.g. Apple, put an end to that idea damn quick, and they floated. Why will Ceres not be taken over by one of our licensees? Because it would destroy the business model on which Ceres success is based.",

SOFC can of course use either, and turbines are well down that duel fuel path too. Gas is widely,  and cheaply, available across most of the US and that is what the Bloom kit for data centres will be using. There is now a politically tricky issue arising in the US around this issue.  Essentially, power companies are jacking up the cost of electricity to domestic customers in areas where new data centre are being built.  Hence operators who build their own power supply (turbine if you can find one, or fuel cell) will get planning permits.  Others will not. Loads of customers for a US based Ceres partner.  I cannot believe we are not is discussions with some US companies.",

I see that Meta  have just sighted power supply contracts with nuclear providers.  Given the volume of natural gas available across the US, fuel cells must be a cheaper option. As I understand it, all large scale gas turbine capacity is sold out over the next three years and it will take a number of years to meaningfully increase that capacity.  Given this would be our fifth/sixth SOFC partner, Ceres should now be able to accelerate the whole transfer process to enable a fast track implementation.  Given the size of the orders Bloom have win, there is a hugely attractive opportunity there.",

I will keep holding, watching, and waiting for a while before selling and subsequently buying back in (temporarily) when the weak phase reappears. I do suspect that the \u00a33 + mark is on the cards fairly soon now.

Each time, I look for a 4.5% profit and then decide whether to sell (or buy) .  I buy or sell too soon at times and have to wait for the next trend reversal. Sometimes only days, other times months but have not yet taken a cash loss. At present stock price I'm up around 6% on the \u00a350k holding I bought about six or eight weeks ago but up more than 25% over the last 12 months by watching, waiting,  and constantly evaluating the changing trend and then trading in or out as my research(and gut feeling) dictates. Overall, I have great faith in CWR as an investment, and I would not want to be in cash for long at present. Overall I think that the chance of an upward explosion in the share price is greater than a sudden lurch downward. As always, you \"pays your money and takes your chance\"!",

Were one of our licensees to buy Ceres, that neutrality is void, no matter how many 'nice' statements the new owner might make.  That would be the beginning of the end for Ceres and an open invitation to the other licensees to rip off the technology, or diversify away from Ceres. Ceres is often spoken of as being an intellectual property company in the same model as ARM (in semi-conductors) Does anyone remember when NVIDIA tried to buy ARM before it floated on  NASDAQ?  The reaction from ARM's other customers e.g. Apple, put an end to that idea damn quick, and they floated. Why will Ceres not be taken over by one of our licensees? Because it would destroy the business model on which Ceres success is based.",

SOFC can of course use either, and turbines are well down that duel fuel path too. Gas is widely,  and cheaply, available across most of the US and that is what the Bloom kit for data centres will be using. There is now a politically tricky issue arising in the US around this issue.  Essentially, power companies are jacking up the cost of electricity to domestic customers in areas where new data centre are being built.  Hence operators who build their own power supply (turbine if you can find one, or fuel cell) will get planning permits.  Others will not. Loads of customers for a US based Ceres partner.

(NYSE:BE) stock is gaining attention after RBC Capital reiterated its Outperform rating and $143.00 price target on the fuel cell manufacturer. The stock currently trades at $151, slightly above the target, after delivering an impressive 525% return over the past year. The reiteration follows the discovery of an air permit filing that indicates Bloom Energy fuel cells will power a 1.5 GW datacenter in Navarro County, Texas. The permit, filed by Hedgehog USA on December 29, 2025, details plans to use 4,615 Bloom Energy servers for electricity generation at a \"purpose-built, off-grid energy & data center.\" According to the filing, construction is scheduled to begin in August 2026, with the first phase starting with a 104 MW behind-the-meter solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) foundation before expanding to 300 MW, then to 800 MW and beyond. RBC Capital views this development as \"another proof point that BE\u2019s fuel cells are being broadly adopted by datacenters at scale\" and highlights the company\u2019s behind-the-meter opportunity in the datacenter market. Investors should note that Bloom Energy will report its next quarterly earnings on February 5, with analysts expecting continued revenue growth.",

My observation re short sellers and the way their game can play out comes from experience that has proven costly in the past, I don\u2019t believe a short seller won\u2019t take a second and third bite of the cherry when the opportunity arises to cast doubt on the value of a business.

          "content": "Given the history of Doosan Fuel Cell\u2019s communication and project milestones, it is reasonable to expect a public announcement of the first deployment of Ceres Power solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) in the near future. In previous cases, Doosan has strategically shared forward-looking information to signal progress and build credibility: for instance, in early 2025, they publicly discussed orders for key components for their Gunsan/Hi\u2011Changwon factory, demonstrating transparency about factory preparation even before mass production began. Then, in July 2025, Doosan announced the official start of mass production of SOFC stacks, emphasizing technical readiness while carefully framing the news around production capacity rather than completed deployments. This pattern continued with the September 2025 Financial News article, which described the anticipated supply of the initial 9\u202fMW batch for the Hi\u2011Changwon project in November, again signaling imminent operational activity without claiming delivery had occurred. The upcoming announcement is especially significant because it will likely represent the first deployment of highly efficient, high-temperature SOFCs in the world, marking a major milestone in stationary and potentially marine fuel cell technology. The Korean governement also incentivize amd encourage these milestones being publicized as adds to economic growth and not to mention markets Doosan to other customers. Given this pattern, if we see an initial deployment article, it is reasonable to expect a subsequent fulfillment report detailing verified operation, confirmed performance, and real-world use will follow in the near future. hTTps://www.alleima.com/en/news-media/archive/2025/01/alleima-receives-an-order-for-mass-production-of-fuel-cells-from-doosan-fuel-cell/?utm_source=chatgpt.com hTTps://en.fnnews.com/news/202509110834454282?utm_source=chatgpt.com hTTps://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/7/28/3122167/0/en/Doosan-Fuel-Cell-begins-mass-production-of-fuel-cell-power-systems-using-Ceres-technology.html Bonus articles... hTTps://m.businesspost.co.kr/BP?num=415936&command=mobile_view&utm_source=chatgpt.com hTTps://www.doosanfuelcell.com/en/media-center/medi-0101_view/?id=165&utm_source=chatgpt.com",

Read the last sentence twice. The firm engages in statistical arbitrage by going through data to find trading signals and patterns related to securities. A machine learning approach is used where computers are trained to operate independently with no human supervision to write algorithms that make predictions for trades. The founders have stated these algorithms are like black boxes, and they do not know how they work internally. An example of machine learning involves the analysis of terabytes of data on every price change of every stock in 15 years. While other peers also use machine learning, Voleon focuses solely on it when performing trades",

(NYSE:BE) stock is gaining attention after RBC Capital reiterated its Outperform rating and $143.00 price target on the fuel cell manufacturer. The stock currently trades at $151, slightly above the target, after delivering an impressive 525% return over the past year. The reiteration follows the discovery of an air permit filing that indicates Bloom Energy fuel cells will power a 1.5 GW datacenter in Navarro County, Texas. The permit, filed by Hedgehog USA on December 29, 2025, details plans to use 4,615 Bloom Energy servers for electricity generation at a \"purpose-built, off-grid energy & data center.\" According to the filing, construction is scheduled to begin in August 2026, with the first phase starting with a 104 MW behind-the-meter solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) foundation before expanding to 300 MW, then to 800 MW and beyond. RBC Capital views this development as \"another proof point that BE\u2019s fuel cells are being broadly adopted by datacenters at scale\" and highlights the company\u2019s behind-the-meter opportunity in the datacenter market. Investors should note that Bloom Energy will report its next quarterly earnings on February 5, with analysts expecting continued revenue growth.",

My observation re short sellers and the way their game can play out comes from experience that has proven costly in the past, I don\u2019t believe a short seller won\u2019t take a second and third bite of the cherry when the opportunity arises to cast doubt on the value of a business. As for my present holding I am hopeful that Ceres will flourish but will continue with a trailing stop loss sell order as nothing is for certain particularly in the carbon economy.",

          "content": "Given the history of Doosan Fuel Cell\u2019s communication and project milestones, it is reasonable to expect a public announcement of the first deployment of Ceres Power solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) in the near future. In previous cases, Doosan has strategically shared forward-looking information to signal progress and build credibility: for instance, in early 2025, they publicly discussed orders for key components for their Gunsan/Hi\u2011Changwon factory, demonstrating transparency about factory preparation even before mass production began. Then, in July 2025, Doosan announced the official start of mass production of SOFC stacks, emphasizing technical readiness while carefully framing the news around production capacity rather than completed deployments. This pattern continued with the September 2025 Financial News article, which described the anticipated supply of the initial 9\u202fMW batch for the Hi\u2011Changwon project in November, again signaling imminent operational activity without claiming delivery had occurred. The upcoming announcement is especially significant because it will likely represent the first deployment of highly efficient, high-temperature SOFCs in the world, marking a major milestone in stationary and potentially marine fuel cell technology. The Korean governement also incentivize amd encourage these milestones being publicized as adds to economic growth and not to mention markets Doosan to other customers. Given this pattern, if we see an initial deployment article, it is reasonable to expect a subsequent fulfillment report detailing verified operation, confirmed performance, and real-world use will follow in the near future. hTTps://www.alleima.com/en/news-media/archive/2025/01/alleima-receives-an-order-for-mass-production-of-fuel-cells-from-doosan-fuel-cell/?utm_source=chatgpt.com hTTps://en.fnnews.com/news/202509110834454282?utm_source=chatgpt.com hTTps://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/7/28/3122167/0/en/Doosan-Fuel-Cell-begins-mass-production-of-fuel-cell-power-systems-using-Ceres-technology.html Bonus articles... hTTps://m.businesspost.co.kr/BP?num=415936&command=mobile_view&utm_source=chatgpt.com hTTps://www.doosanfuelcell.com/en/media-center/medi-0101_view/?id=165&utm_source=chatgpt.com",

A machine learning approach is used where computers are trained to operate independently with no human supervision to write algorithms that make predictions for trades. The founders have stated these algorithms are like black boxes, and they do not know how they work internally. An example of machine learning involves the analysis of terabytes of data on every price change of every stock in 15 years. While other peers also use machine learning, Voleon focuses solely on it when performing trades",

(NYSE:BE) stock is gaining attention after RBC Capital reiterated its Outperform rating and $143.00 price target on the fuel cell manufacturer. The stock currently trades at $151, slightly above the target, after delivering an impressive 525% return over the past year. The reiteration follows the discovery of an air permit filing that indicates Bloom Energy fuel cells will power a 1.5 GW datacenter in Navarro County, Texas. The permit, filed by Hedgehog USA on December 29, 2025, details plans to use 4,615 Bloom Energy servers for electricity generation at a \"purpose-built, off-grid energy & data center.\" According to the filing, construction is scheduled to begin in August 2026, with the first phase starting with a 104 MW behind-the-meter solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) foundation before expanding to 300 MW, then to 800 MW and beyond. RBC Capital views this development as \"another proof point that BE\u2019s fuel cells are being broadly adopted by datacenters at scale\" and highlights the company\u2019s behind-the-meter opportunity in the datacenter market. Investors should note that Bloom Energy will report its next quarterly earnings on February 5, with analysts expecting continued revenue growth.",

My observation re short sellers and the way their game can play out comes from experience that has proven costly in the past, I don\u2019t believe a short seller won\u2019t take a second and third bite of the cherry when the opportunity arises to cast doubt on the value of a business.

          "content": "Given the history of Doosan Fuel Cell\u2019s communication and project milestones, it is reasonable to expect a public announcement of the first deployment of Ceres Power solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) in the near future. In previous cases, Doosan has strategically shared forward-looking information to signal progress and build credibility: for instance, in early 2025, they publicly discussed orders for key components for their Gunsan/Hi\u2011Changwon factory, demonstrating transparency about factory preparation even before mass production began. Then, in July 2025, Doosan announced the official start of mass production of SOFC stacks, emphasizing technical readiness while carefully framing the news around production capacity rather than completed deployments. This pattern continued with the September 2025 Financial News article, which described the anticipated supply of the initial 9\u202fMW batch for the Hi\u2011Changwon project in November, again signaling imminent operational activity without claiming delivery had occurred. The upcoming announcement is especially significant because it will likely represent the first deployment of highly efficient, high-temperature SOFCs in the world, marking a major milestone in stationary and potentially marine fuel cell technology. The Korean governement also incentivize amd encourage these milestones being publicized as adds to economic growth and not to mention markets Doosan to other customers. Given this pattern, if we see an initial deployment article, it is reasonable to expect a subsequent fulfillment report detailing verified operation, confirmed performance, and real-world use will follow in the near future. hTTps://www.alleima.com/en/news-media/archive/2025/01/alleima-receives-an-order-for-mass-production-of-fuel-cells-from-doosan-fuel-cell/?utm_source=chatgpt.com hTTps://en.fnnews.com/news/202509110834454282?utm_source=chatgpt.com hTTps://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/7/28/3122167/0/en/Doosan-Fuel-Cell-begins-mass-production-of-fuel-cell-power-systems-using-Ceres-technology.html Bonus articles... hTTps://m.businesspost.co.kr/BP?num=415936&command=mobile_view&utm_source=chatgpt.com hTTps://www.doosanfuelcell.com/en/media-center/medi-0101_view/?id=165&utm_source=chatgpt.com",

A machine learning approach is used where computers are trained to operate independently with no human supervision to write algorithms that make predictions for trades. The founders have stated these algorithms are like black boxes, and they do not know how they work internally. An example of machine learning involves the analysis of terabytes of data on every price change of every stock in 15 years. While other peers also use machine learning, Voleon focuses solely on it when performing trades",

          "content": "From investing.com today   (Look at the power ratings to be  supplied) Investing.com - Bloom Energy Corp. (NYSE:BE) stock is gaining attention after RBC Capital reiterated its Outperform rating and $143.00 price target on the fuel cell manufacturer. The stock currently trades at $151, slightly above the target, after delivering an impressive 525% return over the past year. The reiteration follows the discovery of an air permit filing that indicates Bloom Energy fuel cells will power a 1.5 GW datacenter in Navarro County, Texas. The permit, filed by Hedgehog USA on December 29, 2025, details plans to use 4,615 Bloom Energy servers for electricity generation at a \"purpose-built, off-grid energy & data center.\" According to the filing, construction is scheduled to begin in August 2026, with the first phase starting with a 104 MW behind-the-meter solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) foundation before expanding to 300 MW, then to 800 MW and beyond. RBC Capital views this development as \"another proof point that BE\u2019s fuel cells are being broadly adopted by datacenters at scale\" and highlights the company\u2019s behind-the-meter opportunity in the datacenter market. Investors should note that Bloom Energy will report its next quarterly earnings on February 5, with analysts expecting continued revenue growth.",

My observation re short sellers and the way their game can play out comes from experience that has proven costly in the past, I don\u2019t believe a short seller won\u2019t take a second and third bite of the cherry when the opportunity arises to cast doubt on the value of a business.

          "content": "Alpha-dog, I asked AI a few questions on why Doosan was being selected as well as Bloom for SK Ecosystems, and major reason seems to be performance \"Why Ceres Technology is Performing \"Better\" in Recent Testing\u00a0The primary reason you are seeing superior performance metrics from Ceres/Doosan in current research boils down to the Lower Operating Temperature and the Metal-Supported Cell (MSC) design: Thermal Cycling and Durability: Because Ceres cells use a stainless steel base, they can expand and contract much more easily than Bloom\u2019s thick ceramic cells. This allows for faster start/stop cycles. In a data centre environment, being able to ramp up or down quickly is a massive advantage over the \"always-on\" rigidity of older SOFC designs. Sealing and Maintenance: At (600 deg C) (Ceres), sealing the fuel cell is significantly easier and more reliable than at (800 deg C) (Bloom). This leads to lower degradation rates over thousands of hours, which is likely the \"better performance\" you\u2019ve noted in recent data. System Efficiency: While both claim electrical efficiency in the 55\u201360% range (LHV), Ceres-based systems often achieve higher Total System Efficiency when integrated with waste heat recovery because the lower temperature allows for the use of more conventional (and cheaper) balance-of-plant materials. Why SK ecoplant is using both\u00a0SK isn't necessarily \"switching\" because of a failure in Bloom\u2019s tech, but rather because they are playing two different market roles:\u00a0Bloom (The \"Utility Scale\" Workhorse): Bloom has the \"Energy Server\" architecture already mass-produced at a scale Ceres hasn't reached yet. For massive 100MW+ power plants, SK still relies on the Bloom partnership because the supply chain is mature.Ceres/Doosan (The \"High-Spec\" Challenger): By partnering with Doosan (who uses Ceres tech), SK ecoplant can offer solutions for AI Data Centres where thermal management and rapid response are critical. The metal-supported design is also seen as the future of SOEC (Electrolysis) for green hydrogen because it handles the intermittent nature of renewable energy (on/off) much better than ceramics.",

          "content": "Given the history of Doosan Fuel Cell\u2019s communication and project milestones, it is reasonable to expect a public announcement of the first deployment of Ceres Power solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) in the near future. In previous cases, Doosan has strategically shared forward-looking information to signal progress and build credibility: for instance, in early 2025, they publicly discussed orders for key components for their Gunsan/Hi\u2011Changwon factory, demonstrating transparency about factory preparation even before mass production began. Then, in July 2025, Doosan announced the official start of mass production of SOFC stacks, emphasizing technical readiness while carefully framing the news around production capacity rather than completed deployments. This pattern continued with the September 2025 Financial News article, which described the anticipated supply of the initial 9\u202fMW batch for the Hi\u2011Changwon project in November, again signaling imminent operational activity without claiming delivery had occurred. The upcoming announcement is especially significant because it will likely represent the first deployment of highly efficient, high-temperature SOFCs in the world, marking a major milestone in stationary and potentially marine fuel cell technology. The Korean governement also incentivize amd encourage these milestones being publicized as adds to economic growth and not to mention markets Doosan to other customers. Given this pattern, if we see an initial deployment article, it is reasonable to expect a subsequent fulfillment report detailing verified operation, confirmed performance, and real-world use will follow in the near future. hTTps://www.alleima.com/en/news-media/archive/2025/01/alleima-receives-an-order-for-mass-production-of-fuel-cells-from-doosan-fuel-cell/?utm_source=chatgpt.com hTTps://en.fnnews.com/news/202509110834454282?utm_source=chatgpt.com hTTps://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/7/28/3122167/0/en/Doosan-Fuel-Cell-begins-mass-production-of-fuel-cell-power-systems-using-Ceres-technology.html Bonus articles... hTTps://m.businesspost.co.kr/BP?num=415936&command=mobile_view&utm_source=chatgpt.com hTTps://www.doosanfuelcell.com/en/media-center/medi-0101_view/?id=165&utm_source=chatgpt.com",

A machine learning approach is used where computers are trained to operate independently with no human supervision to write algorithms that make predictions for trades. The founders have stated these algorithms are like black boxes, and they do not know how they work internally. An example of machine learning involves the analysis of terabytes of data on every price change of every stock in 15 years.

          "content": "From investing.com today   (Look at the power ratings to be  supplied) Investing.com - Bloom Energy Corp. (NYSE:BE) stock is gaining attention after RBC Capital reiterated its Outperform rating and $143.00 price target on the fuel cell manufacturer. The stock currently trades at $151, slightly above the target, after delivering an impressive 525% return over the past year. The reiteration follows the discovery of an air permit filing that indicates Bloom Energy fuel cells will power a 1.5 GW datacenter in Navarro County, Texas. The permit, filed by Hedgehog USA on December 29, 2025, details plans to use 4,615 Bloom Energy servers for electricity generation at a \"purpose-built, off-grid energy & data center.\" According to the filing, construction is scheduled to begin in August 2026, with the first phase starting with a 104 MW behind-the-meter solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) foundation before expanding to 300 MW, then to 800 MW and beyond. RBC Capital views this development as \"another proof point that BE\u2019s fuel cells are being broadly adopted by datacenters at scale\" and highlights the company\u2019s behind-the-meter opportunity in the datacenter market. Investors should note that Bloom Energy will report its next quarterly earnings on February 5, with analysts expecting continued revenue growth.",

This allows for faster start/stop cycles. In a data centre environment, being able to ramp up or down quickly is a massive advantage over the \"always-on\" rigidity of older SOFC designs. Sealing and Maintenance: At (600 deg C) (Ceres), sealing the fuel cell is significantly easier and more reliable than at (800 deg C) (Bloom). This leads to lower degradation rates over thousands of hours, which is likely the \"better performance\" you\u2019ve noted in recent data. System Efficiency: While both claim electrical efficiency in the 55\u201360% range (LHV), Ceres-based systems often achieve higher Total System Efficiency when integrated with waste heat recovery because the lower temperature allows for the use of more conventional (and cheaper) balance-of-plant materials.

          "content": "Given the history of Doosan Fuel Cell\u2019s communication and project milestones, it is reasonable to expect a public announcement of the first deployment of Ceres Power solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) in the near future. In previous cases, Doosan has strategically shared forward-looking information to signal progress and build credibility: for instance, in early 2025, they publicly discussed orders for key components for their Gunsan/Hi\u2011Changwon factory, demonstrating transparency about factory preparation even before mass production began. Then, in July 2025, Doosan announced the official start of mass production of SOFC stacks, emphasizing technical readiness while carefully framing the news around production capacity rather than completed deployments. This pattern continued with the September 2025 Financial News article, which described the anticipated supply of the initial 9\u202fMW batch for the Hi\u2011Changwon project in November, again signaling imminent operational activity without claiming delivery had occurred. The upcoming announcement is especially significant because it will likely represent the first deployment of highly efficient, high-temperature SOFCs in the world, marking a major milestone in stationary and potentially marine fuel cell technology. The Korean governement also incentivize amd encourage these milestones being publicized as adds to economic growth and not to mention markets Doosan to other customers. Given this pattern, if we see an initial deployment article, it is reasonable to expect a subsequent fulfillment report detailing verified operation, confirmed performance, and real-world use will follow in the near future. hTTps://www.alleima.com/en/news-media/archive/2025/01/alleima-receives-an-order-for-mass-production-of-fuel-cells-from-doosan-fuel-cell/?utm_source=chatgpt.com hTTps://en.fnnews.com/news/202509110834454282?utm_source=chatgpt.com hTTps://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/7/28/3122167/0/en/Doosan-Fuel-Cell-begins-mass-production-of-fuel-cell-power-systems-using-Ceres-technology.html Bonus articles... hTTps://m.businesspost.co.kr/BP?num=415936&command=mobile_view&utm_source=chatgpt.com hTTps://www.doosanfuelcell.com/en/media-center/medi-0101_view/?id=165&utm_source=chatgpt.com",

A machine learning approach is used where computers are trained to operate independently with no human supervision to write algorithms that make predictions for trades. The founders have stated these algorithms are like black boxes, and they do not know how they work internally. An example of machine learning involves the analysis of terabytes of data on every price change of every stock in 15 years. While other peers also use machine learning, Voleon focuses solely on it when performing trades",

          "content": "From investing.com today   (Look at the power ratings to be  supplied) Investing.com - Bloom Energy Corp. (NYSE:BE) stock is gaining attention after RBC Capital reiterated its Outperform rating and $143.00 price target on the fuel cell manufacturer. The stock currently trades at $151, slightly above the target, after delivering an impressive 525% return over the past year. The reiteration follows the discovery of an air permit filing that indicates Bloom Energy fuel cells will power a 1.5 GW datacenter in Navarro County, Texas. The permit, filed by Hedgehog USA on December 29, 2025, details plans to use 4,615 Bloom Energy servers for electricity generation at a \"purpose-built, off-grid energy & data center.\" According to the filing, construction is scheduled to begin in August 2026, with the first phase starting with a 104 MW behind-the-meter solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) foundation before expanding to 300 MW, then to 800 MW and beyond. RBC Capital views this development as \"another proof point that BE\u2019s fuel cells are being broadly adopted by datacenters at scale\" and highlights the company\u2019s behind-the-meter opportunity in the datacenter market. Investors should note that Bloom Energy will report its next quarterly earnings on February 5, with analysts expecting continued revenue growth.",

My observation re short sellers and the way their game can play out comes from experience that has proven costly in the past, I don\u2019t believe a short seller won\u2019t take a second and third bite of the cherry when the opportunity arises to cast doubt on the value of a business.

          "content": "Alpha-dog, I asked AI a few questions on why Doosan was being selected as well as Bloom for SK Ecosystems, and major reason seems to be performance \"Why Ceres Technology is Performing \"Better\" in Recent Testing\u00a0The primary reason you are seeing superior performance metrics from Ceres/Doosan in current research boils down to the Lower Operating Temperature and the Metal-Supported Cell (MSC) design: Thermal Cycling and Durability: Because Ceres cells use a stainless steel base, they can expand and contract much more easily than Bloom\u2019s thick ceramic cells. This allows for faster start/stop cycles. In a data centre environment, being able to ramp up or down quickly is a massive advantage over the \"always-on\" rigidity of older SOFC designs. Sealing and Maintenance: At (600 deg C) (Ceres), sealing the fuel cell is significantly easier and more reliable than at (800 deg C) (Bloom). This leads to lower degradation rates over thousands of hours, which is likely the \"better performance\" you\u2019ve noted in recent data. System Efficiency: While both claim electrical efficiency in the 55\u201360% range (LHV), Ceres-based systems often achieve higher Total System Efficiency when integrated with waste heat recovery because the lower temperature allows for the use of more conventional (and cheaper) balance-of-plant materials. Why SK ecoplant is using both\u00a0SK isn't necessarily \"switching\" because of a failure in Bloom\u2019s tech, but rather because they are playing two different market roles:\u00a0Bloom (The \"Utility Scale\" Workhorse): Bloom has the \"Energy Server\" architecture already mass-produced at a scale Ceres hasn't reached yet. For massive 100MW+ power plants, SK still relies on the Bloom partnership because the supply chain is mature.Ceres/Doosan (The \"High-Spec\" Challenger): By partnering with Doosan (who uses Ceres tech), SK ecoplant can offer solutions for AI Data Centres where thermal management and rapid response are critical. The metal-supported design is also seen as the future of SOEC (Electrolysis) for green hydrogen because it handles the intermittent nature of renewable energy (on/off) much better than ceramics.",

          "content": "Alpha-dog, I asked AI a few questions on why Doosan was being selected as well as Bloom for SK Ecosystems, and major reason seems to be performance \"Why Ceres Technology is Performing \"Better\" in Recent Testing\u00a0The primary reason you are seeing superior performance metrics from Ceres/Doosan in current research boils down to the Lower Operating Temperature and the Metal-Supported Cell (MSC) design: Thermal Cycling and Durability: Because Ceres cells use a stainless steel base, they can expand and contract much more easily than Bloom\u2019s thick ceramic cells. This allows for faster start/stop cycles. In a data centre environment, being able to ramp up or down quickly is a massive advantage over the \"always-on\" rigidity of older SOFC designs. Sealing and Maintenance: At (600 deg C) (Ceres), sealing the fuel cell is significantly easier and more reliable than at (800 deg C) (Bloom). This leads to lower degradation rates over thousands of hours, which is likely the \"better performance\" you\u2019ve noted in recent data. System Efficiency: While both claim electrical efficiency in the 55\u201360% range (LHV), Ceres-based systems often achieve higher Total System Efficiency when integrated with waste heat recovery because the lower temperature allows for the use of more conventional (and cheaper) balance-of-plant materials. Why SK ecoplant is using both\u00a0SK isn't necessarily \"switching\" because of a failure in Bloom\u2019s tech, but rather because they are playing two different market roles:\u00a0Bloom (The \"Utility Scale\" Workhorse): Bloom has the \"Energy Server\" architecture already mass-produced at a scale Ceres hasn't reached yet. For massive 100MW+ power plants, SK still relies on the Bloom partnership because the supply chain is mature.Ceres/Doosan (The \"High-Spec\" Challenger): By partnering with Doosan (who uses Ceres tech), SK ecoplant can offer solutions for AI Data Centres where thermal management and rapid response are critical. The metal-supported design is also seen as the future of SOEC (Electrolysis) for green hydrogen because it handles the intermittent nature of renewable energy (on/off) much better than ceramics.",

          "content": "Given the history of Doosan Fuel Cell\u2019s communication and project milestones, it is reasonable to expect a public announcement of the first deployment of Ceres Power solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) in the near future. In previous cases, Doosan has strategically shared forward-looking information to signal progress and build credibility: for instance, in early 2025, they publicly discussed orders for key components for their Gunsan/Hi\u2011Changwon factory, demonstrating transparency about factory preparation even before mass production began. Then, in July 2025, Doosan announced the official start of mass production of SOFC stacks, emphasizing technical readiness while carefully framing the news around production capacity rather than completed deployments. This pattern continued with the September 2025 Financial News article, which described the anticipated supply of the initial 9\u202fMW batch for the Hi\u2011Changwon project in November, again signaling imminent operational activity without claiming delivery had occurred. The upcoming announcement is especially significant because it will likely represent the first deployment of highly efficient, high-temperature SOFCs in the world, marking a major milestone in stationary and potentially marine fuel cell technology. The Korean governement also incentivize amd encourage these milestones being publicized as adds to economic growth and not to mention markets Doosan to other customers. Given this pattern, if we see an initial deployment article, it is reasonable to expect a subsequent fulfillment report detailing verified operation, confirmed performance, and real-world use will follow in the near future. hTTps://www.alleima.com/en/news-media/archive/2025/01/alleima-receives-an-order-for-mass-production-of-fuel-cells-from-doosan-fuel-cell/?utm_source=chatgpt.com hTTps://en.fnnews.com/news/202509110834454282?utm_source=chatgpt.com hTTps://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/7/28/3122167/0/en/Doosan-Fuel-Cell-begins-mass-production-of-fuel-cell-power-systems-using-Ceres-technology.html Bonus articles... hTTps://m.businesspost.co.kr/BP?num=415936&command=mobile_view&utm_source=chatgpt.com hTTps://www.doosanfuelcell.com/en/media-center/medi-0101_view/?id=165&utm_source=chatgpt.com",

A machine learning approach is used where computers are trained to operate independently with no human supervision to write algorithms that make predictions for trades. The founders have stated these algorithms are like black boxes, and they do not know how they work internally. An example of machine learning involves the analysis of terabytes of data on every price change of every stock in 15 years.

(NYSE:BE) stock is gaining attention after RBC Capital reiterated its Outperform rating and $143.00 price target on the fuel cell manufacturer. The stock currently trades at $151, slightly above the target, after delivering an impressive 525% return over the past year. The reiteration follows the discovery of an air permit filing that indicates Bloom Energy fuel cells will power a 1.5 GW datacenter in Navarro County, Texas. The permit, filed by Hedgehog USA on December 29, 2025, details plans to use 4,615 Bloom Energy servers for electricity generation at a \"purpose-built, off-grid energy & data center.\" According to the filing, construction is scheduled to begin in August 2026, with the first phase starting with a 104 MW behind-the-meter solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) foundation before expanding to 300 MW, then to 800 MW and beyond. RBC Capital views this development as \"another proof point that BE\u2019s fuel cells are being broadly adopted by datacenters at scale\" and highlights the company\u2019s behind-the-meter opportunity in the datacenter market. Investors should note that Bloom Energy will report its next quarterly earnings on February 5, with analysts expecting continued revenue growth.",

My observation re short sellers and the way their game can play out comes from experience that has proven costly in the past, I don\u2019t believe a short seller won\u2019t take a second and third bite of the cherry when the opportunity arises to cast doubt on the value of a business.
