Under the terms of the distribution, all MXC shareholders will receive the same allocation of shares and cash.\nThe completion of the liquidation process is expected to take place on 2 March 2026, and the Distribution will happen shortly thereafter.\nImpact on Tialis\nWhen the Distribution takes place:\n\u00b7\nMXC will cease to be a shareholder in the Company;\n\u00b7\nTialis' share register will become more diversified, with Tialis shares held directly by MXC's underlying shareholders; and\n\u00b7\nThe Company would expect this to increase the free float and liquidity of Tialis shares on AIM.\nThe Board does not expect the Distribution to have any operational impact on Tialis' business, strategy or employees.\nRelationship with MXC\nMXC has been a long-standing and supportive shareholder of Tialis and has contributed meaningfully to the Company's development during this period. The Board would like to record its thanks for MXC's continued support and engagement.\nFollowing completion of the Distribution, any arrangements, understandings or rights which exist between the Company and MXC that are conditional on MXC's shareholding are expected to fall away following completion of the distribution.\nChanges to the board\nTialis is pleased to announce that David Niall O'Regan (\"Niall\"), Chief Operating Officer, has joined the Board of the Company with immediate effect and has been promoted to Chief Executive Officer.\nTialis also announces that Ian Smith has stepped down from his position as Executive Director with immediate effect in order to pursue other business interests. Ian will remain a director of AI Auxesis Limited.\nNiall has been responsible for the Group's operational activities and has worked closely with the Executive Director and Chief Financial Officer to support the delivery of the Group's strategy and operational performance. Niall was appointed to the role in September 2024, having previously served as Commercial Director following the acquisition of certain profitable contracts from Allvotec. He has held several senior leadership roles at Allvotec, including Managing Director, and has over 25 years' experience in senior commercial, sales and operational roles across the technology, managed services, retail, hospitality, and leisure sectors.\nPeter Hallett, current Non-Executive Director has been appointed as Interim Non-Executive Chairman.\nTrading Update for the year ended 31 December 2025\nTialis gives an update on trading for the year ended 31 December 2025.\nFinancial Highlights\nGroup\n\u00b7\nRevenue for the year is expected to be no less than \u00a317m\n\u00b7\nAdjusted EBITDA\n1\nfor the year is expected to be no less than \u00a31.8m\n\u00b7\nRepayment of the bank borrowings of \u00a31m (2024: \u00a3nil)\n\u00b7\n\u00a38.2m invested during the year to support long\u2011term value creation and portfolio diversification through the acquisition of MXLG Acquisitions Limited (\"MXLGA\"),\nAI Auxesis Limited, CloudCoco Group Plc, Digital Petcare Direct Limited and QPC 2020 Limited\no\nMXLGA (50% joint venture investment) - \u00a37.2m\no\nCloudCoCo Group Plc - \u00a30.2m\no\nQPC 2020 Limited - \u00a30.3m\no\nDigital Petcare Direct Limited - \u00a30.5m\n\u00b7\nCustomer concentration risk reduced materially, with exposure from the largest customer declining from 81% (2024) to 60% (2025).\n\u00b7\nTialis enter 2026 with a current sales pipeline of \u00a39m with 13 different partners\nJoint venture\n\u00b7\nMXLGA finished the year with expected revenue to be no less than \u00a322m and adjusted EBITDA\n1\nfor the year is expected to be no less than \u00a32.2m\n\u00b7\nMXLGA enters 2026 with confirmed orders of \u00a38.1m revenue and a pipeline revenue for Q1 2026 of \u00a33.3m, reflecting advanced opportunities within existing customer demand.\n1\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes share-based payment charges along with depreciation, amortisation, interest, and tax from the measure of profit.\nPeter Hallett, Interim Non-Executive Chairman, commented:\n\"Tialis is supportive of MXC's proposal. The proposed distribution would result in a more diversified shareholder base for Tialis and is expected to improve liquidity in the Company's shares. We believe this will be beneficial both for existing shareholders and for those joining the register as a result of the distribution.\nOn behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Ian for his valuable support and contribution to Tialis over a number of years. We wish him every success in his future endeavours.\nWe are delighted to welcome Niall to the Board, having already benefitted significantly from his experience and expertise in his prior role as Chief Operating Officer.\"\nFor more information, contact:\nTialis Essential IT Plc\nPeter Hallett, Interim Non-Executive Chairman\nTel: +44 (0)344 874 1000\nCavendish Capital Markets Ltd\nNominated Adviser and Broker\nCorporate Finance: Jonny Franklin-Adams/ Elysia Bough\nCorporate Broking: Tim Redfern\nTel: +44 (0)20 7220 0500\nFurther regulatory disclosures relating\u00a0to a director appointment\nOther than as disclosed below, there are no further disclosures to be made in accordance with AIM Rule 17 and paragraph (g) of Schedule Two of the AIM Rules for Companies.\nFull Name: David Niall O'Regan\nAge: 58\nCurrent Directorships / Partnerships:\n\u00b7\nTialis Essential IT Financing Limited\n\u00b7\nTialis Essential IT Manage Limited\nPrevious Directorships / Partnerships (held in the past five years)\nNone in last 5 years\nNiall does not hold any shares in the Company.\u00a0Niall holds 53,825 options over ordinary shares of 1p each Tialis Essential IT plc which represent 0.13% of the Company's ordinary issued share capital.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

We are maintaining a strong current sales pipeline of \u00a38m annual value while continuing to grow our partner base with the addition of a large global system integrator in Q2 2025.\nPost period end and as previously announced, Tialis was awarded a significant follow-on framework agreement from a long-standing and valued customer.\nThe expanded agreement, valued at approximately \u00a350 million, builds on the Company's previous work with the long-standing customer and will run over 5 years. Under the new framework, Tialis will deliver Lifecycle Services, Tech Bars, End User Support and Field Engineering supporting the long-standing customer's business.\nThis follow-on award reflects the strength and depth of the Company's relationship with the long-standing customer and demonstrates the high level of customer satisfaction with the delivery record of Tialis. It will further enhance the Group's order book and revenue visibility for the next financial year.\nTialis was awarded a material new contract with one of the UK Government's principal departments overseeing environmental policy, agriculture, and rural community development, as previously announced. We commenced delivery of this contract on 1 September 2025. The contract, with a total value of approximately \u00a315 million, will run over 5 years and involves the delivery of Lifecycle Services, Tech Bars, End User Support and Field Engineering, supporting this large UK Government Department build the workplace of tomorrow. The award follows a competitive tender process and further strengthens the Tialis order book, increasing contracted revenue visibility for the current financial year and beyond and is expected to deliver significant additional project revenue in its lifetime. This win is consistent with the Company's stated strategy of building long-term, high-value client relationships.\nRevenues in the period were lower than the prior period, primarily due to delayed customer orders in the context of a challenging financial market environment. The Board believes these conditions are cyclical and that underlying demand for the Group's services remains robust. The loss of two significant contracts which were both in-sourced by the end-customers earlier than originally anticipated with the channel partners has also impacted the revenues.\nThe Group enters the second half of 2025 with a strong pipeline and a sharpened focus on strategic growth areas. Management expects further progress in Lifecycle services, continued partner expansion, and a stronger H2 performance.\nLeveraging on the continued success of the Allvotec acquisition in 2023, Tialis has been able to agree renewals and extensions of the existing contracts, increasing the deferred and contingent consideration settlement agreed with Daisy HoldCo Limited to \u00a31.638 million. This will be paid in shares issued in Tialis Essential IT PLC, at an effective price of 70 pence per ordinary share. This increase of \u00a3582k (FY 2024: \u00a3971k) is shown as a fair value adjustment on the face of the Statement of Comprehensive Income.\nAcquisitions and Investments\nAs announced in the final results for the year ended 31 December 2024, Tialis has undertaken or is planning to undertake several new deals to expand its activities and to deliver growth through acquisition with synergistic targets to deepen its service offerings. The opportunity has now arisen to consolidate several investments into Tialis, to accrete shareholder value today and for the future. This will create the ability to manage a pool of permanent capital and assets, leverage the cashflow from those into dividends and create further capital growth.\nAI Auxesis\nIn April 2025, the creation of the Subsidiary, AI Auxesis Limited required an upfront investment of \u00a3250,000 that has been used to fund its first consulting project which has started generating revenue. This investment was 50% funded by the Company and the remaining 50% funded by direct contributions of \u00a362,",

Upon the publication of this announcement, this inside information is now considered to be in the public domain.\nTialis Essential IT Plc (\"Tialis\" or the \"Company\")\nStrategy update and issue of equity\nTialis, the mid-market IT Managed Services provider, announces the acquisition of a loan agreement from MXC Capital Guernsey Limited (\"MXC\") between MXC and Digital Petcare UK Limited (\"Digital Petcare\"). The loan has an outstanding value of \u00a31.485m and carries an interest rate of 12%. In exchange Tialis will issue 2,320,313 Ordinary Shares of 1p each (\"Ordinary Shares\") to MXC, at the mid-market closing price on 30 June 2025 of 64p, to the same value of the outstanding loan. The loan has been placed into a newly created subsidiary of Tialis called Tialis Essential IT Debt Limited.\nConcurrently, Tialis has also acquired MXC's outstanding equity positon, of approximately 10.6%, in CloudCoCo Group PLC (\"CloudCoCo\"). In exchange Tialis will issue 310,821 Ordinary Shares to MXC, at the mid-market closing price on 30 June 2025 of 64p, to the value of \u00a3198,926, being the corresponding share value in CloudCoCo at 30 June 2025.\nThis is the first of several new deals that Tialis is planning to undertake as it expands its activities to deliver growth through acquisition and considers synergistic targets to deepen its service offerings, as announced in the final results for the year ended 31 December 2024, which could include becoming a diversified holdings company.\nBackground\nTialis is led by Ian Smith, Executive Director, who, over the last 21 years, has completed over 100 investments, divestments, acquisitions and restructurings in the tech sector. Notable exits include Matrix Communications, Anix, Accumuli, Castleton Software, and Tax Systems - all public companies. Restructurings included Redstone PLC, Maxima PLC, 2Ergo PLC and Calyx.\nOver the last 7 years, Ian has also been a consultant to the Guernsey Investment Fund.\nThe opportunity has now arisen to consolidate a number of investments into Tialis, realising synergies and enabling a greater focus. Accordingly, shareholder approval may be sought for follow on investments as they are traded into Tialis.\nIan Smith said: \"This is an amazing opportunity for Tialis to accrete shareholder value today and for the future. The chance to manage a pool of permanent capital and assets, leverage the cashflow from those into dividends and create further capital growth was too good to miss. I have a long track record of delivering value in this sector and intend to do it again but this time from a higher starting point. It is my intention to build on my share ownership of the Company for the foreseeable future\".\nIssue of Equity and Total Voting Rights\nApplication will be made to the London Stock Exchange for the admission of 2,631,134 Ordinary Shares to trading on AIM (\"Admission\"). It is expected that Admission will become effective and dealings in the new Ordinary Shares will commence on or around 7 July 2025.\nThe new Ordinary Shares will be issued fully paid and will rank pari passu in all respects with the Company's existing Ordinary Shares.\nFollowing Admission, the total number of Ordinary Shares in the capital of the Company in issue will be 27,166,211. As the Company does not currently hold any Ordinary Shares in treasury, the total number of voting rights in the Company following Admission will be 27,166,211. This figure may be used by Shareholders, from Admission, as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change in their interest in, the share capital of the Company under the FCA's Disclosure and Transparency Rules.\nRelated Party Transaction\nIan Smith, by virtue of being a director and significant shareholder of the Company and MXC, is considered to be a related party of the Company.\nAs such, both the acquisition by Tialis of the Digital Petcare loan from MXC and the CloudCoco equity share swap, constitute related party transactions for the purposes of Rule 13 of the AIM Rules for Companies (together, the \"Related Party Transactions\").\nThe Directors of the Company (other than Ian Smith) consider, having consulted with Cavendish Capital Markets Limited, the Company's Nominated Adviser, that the terms of the Related Party Transaction are fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned.\nIan Smith is also the Chief Executive Officer and major shareholder of MXC. Following the above transactions, MXC's h",

We are generating a strong annuity income stream, with a strong pipeline of prospects.\nTo date Tialis has confirmation of new business, preferred partner and contract extensions totalling approximately \u00a317.8m, marking an excellent start to 2025. Encouragingly a sizeable proportion of the customer wins are 5 year contracts, with multi-million-pound contracts for our lifecycle division.\nLeveraging on the continued success of the Allvotec acquisition in 2023, during the year 2024, Tialis was able to agree renewals and extensions of the existing contracts, increasing the deferred and contingent consideration estimate to \u00a31.055 million. Once agreed, this will be paid in shares issued in Tialis Essential IT PLC, at an effective price of 89.2 pence per ordinary share. This increase of \u00a3971,243 is shown as a fair value adjustment on the face of the Statement of Comprehensive Income.\nHighlights in the year include:\n\u00b7\nSignificant year on year increase in positive cash generation\n\u00b7\nTialis entered into a \u00a34m Revolving Credit Facility (\"RCF\") with Santander during the year. The RCF carries an interest rate of SONIA + 3.75 per cent, with a term of 3 years. The RCF was used for early repayment of the loan notes totalling \u00a34.2m which were due for repayment in January and December 2025.\n\u00b7\nNew business awards with net new partners of \u00a32.5m annual value in 2024\n\u00b7\nNew business awards of \u00a315m TCV to date in 2025\n\u00b7\nA strong current sales pipeline of \u00a38m annual value with a record number of 16 different partners, allowing for good visibility over future growth\n\u00b7\nSuccessful renewals ISO 9001, ISO 14001, ISO 20000-1 & ISO 27001 certifications\n\u00b7\nCyber Essentials & Cyber Essentials Plus re-award\n\u00b7\nSilver EcoVadis status awarded for sustainability performance\n\u00b7\nLooking forward, revenue for 2025 is expected to be made up of 46% contracted revenue, 28% anticipated contract extensions, and 26% new business\nThe board is committed to growing Tialis both from M&A activities and organic sales, and we collectively intend the Group to become a cash generating vehicle and will look to implement a progressive dividend policy in the future. The recent acquisition of shares from an existing institution is testament to our commitment, which only adds to the substantial shareholding between Daisy Intermediate Holdings Limited / Matthew Riley and MXC Capital Limited / Ian Smith.

However, we have continued to be frustrated by delays in new contract awards.\n\u00b7\nLifecycle revenue in the first six months increased by 37% to \u00a32.0m. As we pivot from traditional engineering services, this is the strategic service we provide to the majority of our Partners, and continue to see significant opportunities in this space, both in end-user devices and increasingly in mobile.\n\u00b7\nWe have a cash-generative business and a profitable business at an adjusted EBITDA level.\n\u00b7\nAndy Parker, the Executive Chairman, has stepped down today and Nicolas Bedford, current Non-Executive Director, has been appointed Non-Executive Chairman.\nFinancing\n\u00b7\nWe are pleased to announce that we have agreed a \u00a34m Revolving Credit Facility (\"RCF\") with Santander. The RCF carries an interest rate of SONIA + 3.75 per cent. and is for a term of 3 years. The RCF will be used for early repayment of the loan notes of \u00a34.2m which are due for repayment in January and December 2025.\n\u00b7\nIn addition to the RCF, MXC Capital (\"MXC\") has agreed to provide a convertible loan note of \u00a3300k to bridge the small shortfall between the RCF and the outstanding balance of the loan notes plus associated costs of setting up the RCF and to provide a small amount of working capital. See further details below.\nRelated party loan\nThe loan with MXC is an unsecured convertible loan for \u00a3300,000 which has an annual compound interest rate of 15%. The convertible is for a term of five years. However, the Company expects to repay the loan by 31 March 2025. MXC has the option to convert the loan to new ordinary shares at a fixed price of 40 pence.\nMXC is deemed to be a related party of the Company pursuant to the AIM Rules for Companies (the \"AIM Rules\") as they are a substantial shareholder and because Ian Smith, CEO of MXC is Executive Director of Tialis.\nNicolas Bedford and Matt Riley, being the independent directors of Tialis for these purposes consider, having consulted with the Company's nominated adviser, Cavendish Capital Markets Limited, that the terms of the related party transaction are fair and reasonable insofar as the shareholders of the Company are concerned.\nBoard changes\nAndy Parker, Executive Chairman, has today stepped down following six years with the Company as both Non-Executive and Executive Chairman. Nicolas Bedford, current Non-Executive Director replaces Andy as Non-Executive Chairman.\nIan Smith, Executive Director, commented:\n\"On behalf of the board I thank Andy for his valuable input.

Immediately following the capital reorganisation, the loan notes (\"Loan Notes\") held by MXC were converted into equity, reducing the debt level of the group to a sensible level. Note 27 sets-out in detail the Company's capital reorganisation.\nManage\nDuring 2022, Tialis Essential IT Manage Limited's turnover remained consistent at \u00a314.5 million (2021: \u00a314.5 million).\nAdjusted EBITDA for Manage, before unallocated group overheads, decreased from \u00a33.8 million to \u00a32.6 million, this reflects the change in business mix and a decrease in one-off projects experienced in 2022.\nFor the 2023 financial year, we have a higher level of visibility over revenues. It is anticipated that the successful transition of some of our traditional service contracts into our lifecycle facility will see margins step back up year on year.\nEmployee numbers within the Manage business increased by 15% within the year due to the company taking on more onsite managed service contracts. The number of heads in our central function decreased by 12 in the year.\nHighlights in the year include:\n\u00b7\nThe sale of IDE Connect in October 2021 enabled the company to return to profit (before finance costs) in 2022 and allowed us to concentrate on end user device and on-site support services rather than chase the market in many different directions.\n\u00b7\nAlthough revenue for 2022 was flat on 2021, the company is fundamentally stronger as the income is derived from recurring revenue. 2021 revenue was bolstered by a number of very large, one-off projects.\n\u00b7\nThe acquisition of the\nprofitable partner contracts from Allvotec Limited, a division of Daisy Group,\nadds circa 50% to our revenues in 2023.\n\u00b7\nIn May 22, the company signed a seven figure multi-year contract with a major nuclear organisation which has doubled the annualised revenue on that account.\n\u00b7\nExtended relationship with Indian Global outsourcer to mid-2023.\n\u00b7\nContinued to expand our preferred supplier agreement with major partner and over doubled the revenue from 2021 to 2022.\n\u00b7\nVia our partnership with CloudCoCo two large charities started large lifecycle contracts across all users within their organisations.\n\u00b7\nTook over the Tech Bar support operation for major German multinational in multi-year deal.\n\u00b7\nStarted two important support relationships with large City insurance companies, which will both be experiencing significant expansion in 2023.\n\u00b7\nStarted year one of a three-year project with UK utility in 2022.\n\u00b7\nAwarded Approved Supplier status with major UK IT service provider.\n\u00b7\nIn December 2022, signed in excess of a million pound a year contract for a minimum of 3 years with major UK print company which is due to start in June 2023.\nResults\nRevenue\nremained steady\nfor the full year at \u00a314.5 million (2021 continuing operations: \u00a314.5 million), and we have seen gross profit margin fall by\n8\n%, from 43% to 35%. Resulting gross profit has decreased year-on-year to \u00a35.1 million (2021 continuing operations: \u00a36.3 million). Adjusted EBITDA decreased to \u00a32.0 million (2021: Adjusted EBITDA of \u00a33.1 million). The net\nloss\nafter tax\nfor the year from continuing operations is \u00a30.6 million (2021: \u00a32.0 million), after \u00a31.2 million amortisation expense and a \u00a30.9 million gain on conversion of the secured loan notes (2021 continuing operations: \u00a33.0 million amortisation and impairment charge).\nPeople\nThe management team has made continued progress in simplifying the structure of the business and aligning services better to support our clients. The board would like to recognise and thank its employees who have worked hard to deliver excellent client service and retain existing key clients.

It\u2019s obviously the best decision for them, retiring, and they take us with them. Open to conjecture whether Smith and cohort see something in Tialis for the future. It\u2019s with a lot to the Mxc concert party, individually.",
