Under the terms of the distribution, all MXC shareholders will receive the same allocation of shares and cash.\nThe completion of the liquidation process is expected to take place on 2 March 2026, and the Distribution will happen shortly thereafter.\nImpact on Tialis\nWhen the Distribution takes place:\n\u00b7\nMXC will cease to be a shareholder in the Company;\n\u00b7\nTialis' share register will become more diversified, with Tialis shares held directly by MXC's underlying shareholders; and\n\u00b7\nThe Company would expect this to increase the free float and liquidity of Tialis shares on AIM.\nThe Board does not expect the Distribution to have any operational impact on Tialis' business, strategy or employees.\nRelationship with MXC\nMXC has been a long-standing and supportive shareholder of Tialis and has contributed meaningfully to the Company's development during this period. The Board would like to record its thanks for MXC's continued support and engagement.\nFollowing completion of the Distribution, any arrangements, understandings or rights which exist between the Company and MXC that are conditional on MXC's shareholding are expected to fall away following completion of the distribution.\nChanges to the board\nTialis is pleased to announce that David Niall O'Regan (\"Niall\"), Chief Operating Officer, has joined the Board of the Company with immediate effect and has been promoted to Chief Executive Officer.\nTialis also announces that Ian Smith has stepped down from his position as Executive Director with immediate effect in order to pursue other business interests. Ian will remain a director of AI Auxesis Limited.\nNiall has been responsible for the Group's operational activities and has worked closely with the Executive Director and Chief Financial Officer to support the delivery of the Group's strategy and operational performance. Niall was appointed to the role in September 2024, having previously served as Commercial Director following the acquisition of certain profitable contracts from Allvotec. He has held several senior leadership roles at Allvotec, including Managing Director, and has over 25 years' experience in senior commercial, sales and operational roles across the technology, managed services, retail, hospitality, and leisure sectors.\nPeter Hallett, current Non-Executive Director has been appointed as Interim Non-Executive Chairman.\nTrading Update for the year ended 31 December 2025\nTialis gives an update on trading for the year ended 31 December 2025.\nFinancial Highlights\nGroup\n\u00b7\nRevenue for the year is expected to be no less than \u00a317m\n\u00b7\nAdjusted EBITDA\n1\nfor the year is expected to be no less than \u00a31.8m\n\u00b7\nRepayment of the bank borrowings of \u00a31m (2024: \u00a3nil)\n\u00b7\n\u00a38.2m invested during the year to support long\u2011term value creation and portfolio diversification through the acquisition of MXLG Acquisitions Limited (\"MXLGA\"),\nAI Auxesis Limited, CloudCoco Group Plc, Digital Petcare Direct Limited and QPC 2020 Limited\no\nMXLGA (50% joint venture investment) - \u00a37.2m\no\nCloudCoCo Group Plc - \u00a30.2m\no\nQPC 2020 Limited - \u00a30.3m\no\nDigital Petcare Direct Limited - \u00a30.5m\n\u00b7\nCustomer concentration risk reduced materially, with exposure from the largest customer declining from 81% (2024) to 60% (2025).\n\u00b7\nTialis enter 2026 with a current sales pipeline of \u00a39m with 13 different partners\nJoint venture\n\u00b7\nMXLGA finished the year with expected revenue to be no less than \u00a322m and adjusted EBITDA\n1\nfor the year is expected to be no less than \u00a32.2m\n\u00b7\nMXLGA enters 2026 with confirmed orders of \u00a38.1m revenue and a pipeline revenue for Q1 2026 of \u00a33.3m, reflecting advanced opportunities within existing customer demand.\n1\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes share-based payment charges along with depreciation, amortisation, interest, and tax from the measure of profit.\nPeter Hallett, Interim Non-Executive Chairman, commented:\n\"Tialis is supportive of MXC's proposal. The proposed distribution would result in a more diversified shareholder base for Tialis and is expected to improve liquidity in the Company's shares. We believe this will be beneficial both for existing shareholders and for those joining the register as a result of the distribution.\nOn behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Ian for his valuable support and contribution to Tialis over a number of years. We wish him every success in his future endeavours.\nWe are delighted to welcome Niall to the Board, having already benefitted significantly from his experience and expertise in his prior role as Chief Operating Officer.\"\nFor more information, contact:\nTialis Essential IT Plc\nPeter Hallett, Interim Non-Executive Chairman\nTel: +44 (0)344 874 1000\nCavendish Capital Markets Ltd\nNominated Adviser and Broker\nCorporate Finance: Jonny Franklin-Adams/ Elysia Bough\nCorporate Broking: Tim Redfern\nTel: +44 (0)20 7220 0500\nFurther regulatory disclosures relating\u00a0to a director appointment\nOther than as disclosed below, there are no further disclosures to be made in accordance with AIM Rule 17 and paragraph (g) of Schedule Two of the AIM Rules for Companies.\nFull Name: David Niall O'Regan\nAge: 58\nCurrent Directorships / Partnerships:\n\u00b7\nTialis Essential IT Financing Limited\n\u00b7\nTialis Essential IT Manage Limited\nPrevious Directorships / Partnerships (held in the past five years)\nNone in last 5 years\nNiall does not hold any shares in the Company.\u00a0Niall holds 53,825 options over ordinary shares of 1p each Tialis Essential IT plc which represent 0.13% of the Company's ordinary issued share capital.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
