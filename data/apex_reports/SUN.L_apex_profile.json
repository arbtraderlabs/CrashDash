Key international markets, Japan and Europe, remain strong and, whilst slower than anticipated, new geographic territories are beginning to gain traction.\nManufacturing productivity and supply chain disruptions referred to in the June update have persisted, and are now considered likely to continue to impact profitability in the second half of the year. A complete operational review of both manufacturing operations and supply chain is currently being undertaken, utilising an industry specialist. While measures are already being introduced to improve efficiencies and productivity, they will take time to benefit the overall margin. A series of planned price increases has been implemented however, some of these will be phased in over time due to the fixed term nature of contractual agreements. The Board now expects the Group to report a modest profit at the adjusted EBITDA1 level for FY23, with better momentum in FY24.\nHigher levels of inventory were maintained in the first half of the year to support service levels to customers, and planned destocking in the second half will have a positive impact on cash resources. The Group's lender, Yorkshire Bank / Virgin Money, remains supportive and agreed a waiver for the debt service covenant test for the second quarter of FY23. As at 31 August 2023, the Group had \u00a32.30m in available headroom including a \u00a31.0m undrawn invoice discounting facility, which gives it access to sufficient capital to support its expected revenue growth in the second half of the year and beyond (30 June 2023: \u00a32.41m, including the undrawn facility).\nThe Company announced in May 2023 that Jon Glenn would succeed Nigel Rogers as Chairman at the time of the announcement of interim results in September. As the transition of responsibility as Chair has been conducted smoothly, the Board now considers it appropriate for Jon to take on the role of Chair with immediate effect. Nigel has reiterated his commitment to remain on the Board as an independent non-executive director until a suitable candidate to succeed him has been appointed.\nSurgical Innovations will release its interim results for the six months ended 30 June 2023, on Tuesday 19 September 2023.\nInvestor briefing\nDavid Marsh, Chief Executive Officer, and Charmaine Day, Chief Financial Officer, will provide a live presentation relating to the\u00a0interim results via the Investor Meet Company platform on\u00a019 September 2023 at 4:30 p.m. BST.\nThe presentation is open to all existing and potential shareholders.
