The issues have been promptly addressed\u00a0and\u00a0supply is resuming, with normal deliveries expected in early 2026.\nAs a result of these unanticipated market factors, the Company expects revenues for the year to now be c. \u00a311.5m with a commensurate impact on profits. In addition, as part of its review of year-end inventory holdings, the Board has taken the prudent decision to increase its provision held against slow moving raw material stock.\nNet debt as of 17 December 2025 was \u00a30.4m and the Company continues to closely monitor its working capital position.\nThe Board remains confident of the growing focus on environmental sustainability driving organisations to adopt greener practices, with Surgical Innovations well positioned to capitalise on offering a sustainable solution with the Company's\nreposable\u2122 technology aligning with this shift.\nDavid Marsh, CEO of Surgical Innovations, said:\n\"Whilst we are naturally disappointed with the external market forces having a direct impact on the Group's performance, we remain confident in our reposable\u2122 technology and the overall prospects of the Group going forward.

He is currently Chairman of Inspiration Healthcare Group plc, a leading neonatal respiratory company, and Foster & Freeman Ltd\n(the trading name of the Galton group of companies)\n, a leading forensic imaging manufacturer. He is also a Non-Executive Director of Futura Medical plc, a UK pharmaceutical company focussed on the sexual health market and a Senior Advisor to Moore Walker Partners, a Healthcare & Technology Advisory Services company.

Growth was supported by strong demand for SI-branded products in Europe and Japan, while performance in the USA was adversely affected by tariffs and logistical changes with a key partner, creating headwinds in that market. Despite delivering revenue similar to 2024, the UK business continues to show positive like-for-like momentum. In addition, operational initiatives introduced in 2024 are now delivering cost efficiencies across the Group.\nIn Europe, our investment in training and the development of marketing tools to promote our sustainability message has delivered strong results, driving significant sales growth across the region. This initiative has contributed to an impressive underlying sales increase of 42%, with revenue rising to \u00a31.22m in H1 2025, up from \u00a30.89m in H1 2024. Early stocking orders from Austria and Scandinavia boosted H1 2025 performance, and ongoing activity across Europe is expected to continue driving sales growth throughout the remainder of the year.\nIn the United States the impact of the tariffs and the relocation of a distributor's warehouse has seen a decline in sales to \u00a30.4m in H1 2025 H1 (H1 2024: \u00a30.5m). Whilst sales have normalised it is not anticipated that the H1 2025 shortfall will be recovered, and tariffs are expected to continue to impact opportunities for growth in H2 2025. Additional routes to market continue to be explored but these benefits are not expected to impact 2025.\nThe APAC region has faced a specific distributor challenge resulting in a drop in sales to \u00a30.5m in H1 2025 (H1 2024: \u00a30.54m) which masks an impressive 9% growth from our Japanese partner who consistently produces year-on-year growth. The key challenge has been with the significant structural upheaval with the distributor in India who has experienced a significant reduction in sales personnel. Whilst this is being resolved the impact will continue into H2.\nH1 2025 sales in the UK were \u00a32.74m, broadly in line with H1 2024 of \u00a32.75m, reflecting the impact of portfolio realignment as certain third-party products were discontinued. Excluding the impact from these products, like-for-like sales increased by 10%, highlighting the underlying strength of demand across our core offering. Continued investment in sales capability is expected to support revenue growth in the second half of 2025 and into 2026, while the planned launch of new products in Q4 will further expand our portfolio and enhance our presence in the UK market.\nRest of World (ROW) sales were \u00a30.23m in H1 2025 (H1 2024: \u00a30.81m), a disappointing result following a strong 2024 performance. The decline was largely driven by the loss of business in the Middle East, while the ongoing challenges in Israel also prevented the region from delivering the planned growth.\nOEM revenues were \u00a30.95m in H1 2025 (H1 2024: \u00a31.1m), reflecting the expected reduction as the impact of clearing the backorder position in H1 2024 drops away. Importantly, sales of OEM versions of SI products more than doubled to \u00a30.18m in H1 2025 (H1 2024: \u00a30.09m), highlighting the progress of our strategy to establish strong partnerships with global instrument companies with forecasted sales in H2 expected to be strong.\nCommercial or underlying margins of 34.1% have increased in H1 by 3.5% compared to 2024 FY margins (H1 2024: 34.4%, FY 2024: 30.6%). The reported gross margin of 31.3%, which includes the net cost of manufacturing, is below that of H1 2024 but has improved by 2.5% on the FY 2024 margins (H1 2024: 32.9%; FY 2024: 28.8%). Sales mix within the international business is creating some margin headwinds, albeit is mostly offset by ongoing operational efficiencies.\nThe business has seen limited price increases year over year, albeit several planned increases will come into effect in H2 2025.\nOther operating expenses decreased to \u00a31.86m (H1 2024: \u00a32.50m), as the business continues to benefit from restructuring activities undertaken throughout 2024, and lower headcount. Other operating expenses in H2 2025 are expected to increase from H1 2025 levels as the business invests in its Sales and Marketing footprint, but overall expenditure will remain below H2 2024 levels.\nT\nhe Group generated an adjusted EBITDA profit for the period of \u00a30.37m (H1 2024: \u00a30.00m). The full effect of the savings from the restructuring in 2024, actions on price and further operational efficiencies will deliver improved profitability in H2.\nAdjusted operating\nprofit\nbefore tax for the period (before non-recurring items and share based payment charges) was \u00a30.06m (H1 2024: \u00a30.43m loss). The reported net profit before taxation amounted to \u00a30.02m against a net loss of \u00a30.49m in H1 2024.\nThere was no reported tax charge/credit in the period (H1 2024: nil). In terms of deferred tax, the Group continues to hold substantial corporation tax losses on which management takes a cautious view, and consequently, the Group does not recognise a corresponding deferred tax asset.\nAdjusted net earnings per share amounted to a profit of 0.0020p (H1 2024: 0.040p loss). The net total comprehensive income for the period amounted to a profit of \u00a30.021m (H1 2024: loss of \u00a30.49m).\nFor the first half of 2025, cash used in operations was \u00a30.20m (FY 2024: \u00a30.10m,H1 2024: \u00a30.5m). After continued investment into R&D of \u00a30.1m (FY 2024: \u00a30.24m, H1 2024: \u00a30.16m), capital expenditure of \u00a30.03m (FY 2024: \u00a30.1m,H1 2024: \u00a30.04m) and the financing costs of the existing bank loan and lease liabilities, the Group had available cash balances of \u00a30.5m (31 Dec 2024: \u00a31.2m).\nThe Directors have considered the available cash resources of the Group and the current internal anticipated forecasts and have a reasonable expectation that the Group have adequate resources. Covenant test for the period ending 30 June 2025 has been passed.\nMarket Outlook\nIn the United States, performance is expected to remain constrained as tariffs persist and challenges in developing new routes to market continue. In contrast, the UK is well positioned to capitalise on emerging opportunities, with increased investment in strengthening the sales team and the introduction of new third-party products already beginning to drive growth. Strong growth in Europe during 2025 H1 is expected to continue, albeit at a more moderate pace, while Japan remains on track to deliver a record year, reflecting the continued strength of the business across key international markets.\nSustainability focused initiatives continue to drive sales across key markets, supported by ongoing investment in sales support, marketing, training, and the further development of the financial and environmental calculator. These tools remain highly effective in driving account conversion. The rise in SI-branded product sales is primarily underpinned by the strong emphasis on sustainability, which will remain a priority in H2. Ongoing account conversions in key markets are expected to deliver continued momentum into 2026.\nA cost-reduction project will also be implemented in Q4, with meaningful margin benefits anticipated from early 2026. Additional cost-down initiatives are scheduled throughout 2026, positioning the Company to deliver sustained margin expansion and stronger long-term growth. Building on the successful international rollout of LogiTube, the Company is preparing for the mid-Q4 2025 launch of the illuminated\nLogiTube Lux\n, which is expected to open new market opportunities and broaden the product portfolio. With the redesign and launch of the cutting shielded trocar for YelloPort Elite 5mm completing the range focus is now moving to the next generation device aimed at improving ergonomics and functionality whilst driving cost out of the device.\nOperational and Regulatory Activities\nThe transition to the Medical Device Regulation (\"MDR\") has remained the Company's key priority, requiring significant investment and presenting considerable challenges as the compliance pathway has been navigated. The Company's Quality Management System, technical files, and microbiology data have previously been brought into full MDR compliance, successfully audited by BSI, and fully approved. The final technical file relating to the Logi range, which had been pending for some time, has now been recommended for certification. This represents a major milestone for the business and has absorbed substantial capacity from the Compliance, R&D, and Production Engineering teams, who are now able to redirect their focus towards efficiency and growth opportunities. In addition, the Company has successfully completed key audits for the UKCA mark and the Medical Device Single Audit Program (\"MDSAP\").\nThe operational improvements introduced during 2024 to enhance manufacturing efficiency, reduce costs, and strengthen margins are beginning to deliver benefits, with further gains expected to flow through in the second half of the year.\nIn September 2025, a new Production Director will join the business with a mandate to drive greater operational efficiency across the facility. A key priority will be the rapid introduction of cost-reduction projects aimed at delivering further manufacturing savings.\nCurrent Trading and Outlook\nThe operational improvement and cost reduction programme initiated in 2024 has had a positive impact on the groups profitability and we expect to see the benefits to continue through the rest of this year and into 2026.\nFirst half sales as a consequence of headwinds remained flat. We expect to see the revenue headwinds experienced in the first half continue for the rest of the year, however the introduction of new 3rd party products and enhanced sales tools and account conversations give the board confidence that we have positioned the business for longer term sustainable growth.\nJonathan Glenn\nChairman\n29 September 2025\nUnaudited consolidated income statement for the six months ended 30 June 2025\nUnaudited\nsix months\nended\n30\nJune\n2025\nUnaudited\nsix months\nended\n30\nJune\n2024\nAudited\nYear ended\n31 December\n2024\nNotes\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nRevenue\n3\n6,145\n6,175\n11,945\nCost of sales\n(4,224)\n(4,141)\n(8,509)\nGross profit\n2\n1,921\n2,034\n3,436\nOther operating expenses\n(1,860)\n(2,466)\n(4,227)\nOther income\n-\n-\n-\nAdjusted EBITDA profit *\n373\n(2)\n50\nAmortisation of intangible assets\n(107)\n(84)\n(211)\nDepreciation of tangible assets\n(205)\n(233)\n(477)\nExceptional items\n-\n(113)\n(153)\nShare based payments\n-\nOperating profit / (loss)\n61\n(432)\n(791)\nFinance costs\n4\n(40)\n(55)\n(99)\nImpairment Costs\n-\n-\n(1,160)\nProfit / (loss) before taxation\n21\n(487)\n(2,050)\nTaxation credit/(charge)\n5\n-\n-\n107\nProfit / (loss) and total comprehensive income\n21\n(487)\n(1,943)\nEarnings per share\nBasic\n6\n0.002p\n(0.052p)\n(0.21p)\nDiluted\n6\n0.002p\n(0.052p)\n(0.21p)\n* Adjusted EBITDA is earnings before interest, depreciation, amortisation (including impairment) and exceptional items.\nUnaudited consolidated statement of changes in equity for the six months ended 30 June 2025\nNotes\nShare capital\nShare premium\nCapital\nreserve\nMerger\nreserve\nRetained\nearnings\nTotal\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nBalance as at 1 January 2025\n9,328\n6,587\n329\n1,250\n(8,953)\n8,541\nEmployee share-based payment charge\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTotal -

The financial information set out in the interim report is unaudited.\nThe interim financial information has been prepared in accordance with the AIM Rules for Companies and on a basis consistent with the accounting policies and methods of computation as published by the Group in its annual report for the year ended 31 December 2024, which is available on the Group's website.\nThe Group has chosen not to adopt IAS 34 Interim Financial Statements in preparing these interim financial statements and therefore the interim financial information is not in full compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted for use in the European Union.\nThe financial information set out in this interim report does not constitute statutory financial statements as defined in section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. The figures for the year ended 31 December 2024 have been extracted from the statutory financial statements which have been filed with the Registrar of Companies. The auditor's report on those financial statements was unqualified and did not contain a statement under sections 498(2) and 498(3) of the Companies Act 2006.\nGoing concern and funding\nThe Directors have considered the available cash resources of the Group and the current internal anticipated forecasts and have a reasonable expectation that the Group have adequate resources. The Group is expected to continue to generate cash from operations over the next 12 months as the Group benefits from a lower cost base following restructuring, continues to improve operational efficiencies and reduce inventory. This will therefore provide ample support to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, considered to be at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements.\n2. Disaggregation of gross margin\nThe Group has disaggregated margins in the following table:\nSix months\nending 30\nJune\n2025\n(unaudited)\nSix months\nending 30\nJune\n2024\n(unaudited)\n12 months\nending 31\nDec 2024\n(audited)\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\n\u00a3'000\nRevenue\n6,145\n6,175\n11,945\nCost of Sales\n(4,047)\n(4,053)\n(8,284)\nUnderlying Gross Margin\n2,098\n2,122\n3,661\nUnderlying Gross Margin %\n34.14%\n34.36%\n30.60%\nNet Cost of Manufacturing\n(177)\n(88)\n(225)\nContribution Margin\n1,921\n2,034\n3.436\nContribution Margin %\n31.26%\n32.94%\n28.80%\nUnderlying gross margin (excluding net costs of manufacturing) is an adjusted KPI measure. Nets costs of Manufacturing are overheads that have not been effectively absorbed due to reduced productivity.\nAdjusted KPIs are used by the Board to understand underlying performance and exclude items which distort comparability. The method of adjustments is consistently applied but are not defined in International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and, therefore, are considered to be non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) measures. Accordingly, the relevant IFRS measures are also presented where appropriate.\n3.

Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares in issue. Adjusted Earnings per share is calculated by dividing the adjusted earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders (profit before non-recurring costs, amortisation, impairment costs and share based payments) by the weighted average number of shares in issue.\nThe anti-dilutive effect of unexercised shares options has not been taken into account and therefore the diluted earnings per share is equal to the basic earnings per share.\nThe Group has one category of dilutive potential ordinary shares being share options issued to Directors and employees. The impact of dilutive potential ordinary shares on the calculation of weighted average number of shares is set out below.\nUnaudited\nUnaudited\nAudited\nsix months\nsix months\nyear\nended\nended\nended\n30 June\n30 June\n31 December\n2025\n2024\n2024\n'000s\n'000s\n'000s\nNumber of shares in issue\n932,816\n932,816\n932,816\nDilutive effect of unexercised share options\n1,219\n1,211\n1,215\nDiluted number of shares\n934,035\n934,027\n934,031\n7.
