New results for the 2026 drilling campaign are expected to follow shortly after drilling recommences on 10 February 2026.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nRiversgold continues intersecting shallow gold mineralisation as it expands it gold footprint at the Northern Zone Gold Project near Kalgoorlie in Western Australia.\n\u00b7\nThe balance of the 2025 drilling campaign has now been received, with a further 16 drillholes reported.\n\u00b7\nGold mineralisation continues to expand the northeastern zone and infill the central Saddle area.\n\u00b7\nSignificant results following on from previously announced selection intercepts, include:\n\u00b7\n4m @ 4.09 g/t Au from 54m (NZAC174)\n\u00b7\n1m @ 4.15 g/t Au from 46m (NZAC174)\n\u00b7\n1m @ 4.82 g/t Au from 43m (NZAC178)\n\u00b7\n8m @ 1.23 g/t Au from 44m (NZAC188)\n\u00b7\n8m at 5.81 g/t Au from 46m (NZAC179)\n\u00b7\n7m at 3.48 g/t Au from 48m (NZAC181)\n\u00b7\n5m at 3.13 g/t Au from 41m (NZAC170)\n\u00b7\n4m at 2.28 g/t Au from 43m (NZAC182)\n\u00b7\nConversion of the tenement to a mining lease continues on course with the Native Title agreements signing in December 2025 being a major step forward.\n[1]\n\u00b7\nThe Mine Development and Closure Plan (MDCP) and the associated environmental assessments is progressing with Resource WA.\n\u00b7\nRig booked for 10 February, to begin the 2026 drilling campaign to continue expanding the shallow gold footprint.\nNaheed Memon, CEO of Oracle, commented\n:\n\"These latest results, the last of our 2025 drilling campaign, are excellent and continue to excite us and as we continue to enlarge the north-eastern zone gold mineralised zone, and more importantly have confirmed the continuity of the previously undrilled central saddle zone between the eastern and western mineralised zones. Our modelling suggests that this could constitute part of a ~600m wide zone of shallow oxide mineralisation overlying the Northern Zone porphyry system. I would also like to remind shareholders that we have drilled this porphyry to a depth of around 500m\n[2]\nand we anticipate deeper drilling after we start the mining process with MEGA Resources.\n\"Overall, the outcomes from the 2025 drilling have been very effective in enlarging the shallow, oxide gold footprint at our Kalgoorlie Gold Project, and to strengthen the MEGA Resources mining scenario for 2026\n[3]\n. We are consistently achieving the goal of making the Project bigger in the oxide zone and we will continue to make this shallow gold project significantly larger in Q1 and Q2. I look forward to updating shareholders as we progress the Project further.\"\nThe latest drill programme results (Tables 1-3) continue to successfully intersect the mineralised host porphyry over an increasing footprint and consistently validate the broader gold mineralisation model. Gold mineralisation continues to be intersected in the northeastern area, which remains open laterally and at depth (see Figure 2). The recent results have also successfully infilled the central Saddle area, in a previous undrilled area. A key SW-NE cross-section derived from 3D Leapfrog software is illustrated in Figure 3. The interpretation illustrates gold grade shells derived from all the significant intercepts reported to April 2025. The Leapfrog model will be updated in the next few weeks.\nNorthern Zone is hosted within a porphyry unit (Tonalite-Trondhjemite Intrusion, TTI), with high background gold and horizontal gold mineralised units within the TTI unit. The Northern Zone Project sits within the Canon Shear or fault zone, with further drilling required to define the limits of mineralisation identified to date. The horizontal mineralisation makes drilling to date perpendicular to the gold mineralisation, and no water in drilling to a depth of 60 metres makes the TTI also suitable for drilling with the techniques the Company has utilised to date.\nThis drilling will be used by MEGA Resources in their mine planning for our joint plans to start mining in the first half of 2026.\nFor further information on Oracle, visit the Company\n'\ns website at\nhttp://www.oraclepower.co.uk\nor contact\n:\nOracle Power PLC\nNaheed Memon - CEO +44 (0) 203 580 4314\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser & Broker)\nRory Murphy, Matthew Chandler, Rob Patrick +44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nSt Brides Partners Limited (Financial PR)\nSusie Geliher, Will Turner +44 (0) 20 7236 1177\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of EU Regulation No. 596/2014, which forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended by virtue of the Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019.\nCompetent Person\n'\ns Statement\nThe information in this announcement that relates to exploration results, exploration targets, mineral resources or ore reserves is based on information compiled by Mr Edward Mead, who is a Fellow of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy.

2: JORC INFORMATION\nThe following Tables are provided to ensure compliance with the JORC Code (2012 Edition) requirements for the reporting of Exploration Results at Northern Zone.\nSection 1: Sampling Techniques and Data\n(Criteria in this section applies to all succeeding sections)\nCriteria\nJORC Code explanation\nCommentary\nSampling techniques\nNature and quality of sampling (eg cut channels, random chips, or specific specialised industry standard measurement tools appropriate to the minerals under investigation, such as down hole gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc). These examples should not be taken as limiting the broad meaning of sampling.\nInclude reference to measures taken to ensure sample representivity and the appropriate calibration of any measurement tools or systems used.\nAspects of the determination of mineralisation that are Material to the Public Report.\nIn cases where 'industry standard' work has been done this would be relatively simple (eg 'reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg was pulverised to produce a 30 g charge for fire assay'). In other cases, more explanation may be required, such as where there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling problems. Unusual commodities or mineralisation types (eg submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed information.\nEvery metre drilled was placed on the ground.\n6m composites were collected using a scoop method of sampling the coarse reject sample for the first 24m.\n1m sampling using a rifle splitter was trialed on the clays, from 24m, with sampling deemed to create a high degree risk of smearing. The clays are not wet, but have a damp characteristic. A large metal scoop was used to sample between 70-90% of material from each metre drilled, to total between 2-3kg samples.\nStandard reference material, sample duplicates and blanks, were undertaken at 25m sample intervals.\nSamples were sent to the laboratory for crushing, splitting and analysis.\nAnalysis was undertaken by Jinnings laboratories (Kalgoorlie) for gold assay by 50g fire assay.\nDrilling techniques\nDrill type (eg core, reverse circulation, open-hole hammer, rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, sonic, etc) and details (eg core diameter, triple or standard tube, depth of diamond tails, face-sampling bit or other type, whether core is oriented and if so, by what method, etc).\nAustralian Surface Drilling completed the program using a face sampling hammer on an Atlas Copco grade control rig.\nDrill sample recovery\nMethod of recording and assessing core and chip sample recoveries and results assessed.\nMeasures taken to maximise sample recovery and ensure representative nature of the samples.\nWhether a relationship exists between sample recovery and grade and whether sample bias may have occurred due to preferential loss/gain of fine/coarse material.\nDrill recovery was routinely recorded via estimation of the comparative percentage of the volume of the sample bag by the company geologist.\nThe sample recovery was deemed excellent for representative assays.\nThe cyclone was cleaned or checked every 6m.\nLogging\nWhether core and chip samples have been geologically and geotechnically logged to a level of detail to support appropriate Mineral Resource estimation, mining studies and metallurgical studies.\nWhether logging is qualitative or quantitative in nature. Core (or costean, channel, etc) photography.\nThe total length and percentage of the relevant intersections logged.\nAll holes have been geologically logged for lithology, mineralisation and weathering. As well as whether dry, damp or wet.\nLogging is quantitative for presence of quartz veins. All other logging is qualitative.\nA brief description of each drilling sample was recorded and a permanent record has been collected and stored in chip trays for reference.\nSub-sampling techniques and sample preparation\nIf core, whether cut or sawn and whether quarter, half or all core taken.\nIf non-core, whether riffled, tube sampled, rotary split, etc and whether sampled wet or dry.\nFor all sample types, the nature, quality and appropriateness of the sample preparation technique.\nQuality control procedures adopted for all sub-sampling stages to maximise representivity of samples.\nMeasures taken to ensure that the sampling is representative of the in-situ material collected, including for instance results for field duplicate/second-half sampling.\nWhether sample sizes are appropriate to the grain size of the material being sampled.\n1m sampling using a rifle splitter was trialed on the clays, from 24m, with sampling deemed to create a high degree risk of smearing. The clays are not wet, but have a damp characteristic. A large metal scoop was used to sample between 70-90% of material from each metre drilled, to total between 2-3kg samples.\nStandard reference material, sample duplicates and blanks, were undertaken at 25m sample intervals.\nSamples were sent to the laboratory for crushing, splitting and analysis.\nThe use of fire assay with 50g charge for all AC drilling provides a level of confidence in the assay database. The sampling and assaying are considered representative of the in-situ material.\nThe sample size of 2-3 kilograms is appropriate and representative of the grain size and mineralisation style of the deposit.\nQuality of assay data and laboratory tests\nThe nature, quality and appropriateness of the assaying and laboratory procedures used and whether the technique is considered partial or total.\nFor geophysical tools, spectrometers, handheld XRF instruments, etc, the parameters used in determining the analysis including instrument make and model, reading times, calibrations factors applied and their derivation, etc.\nNature of quality control procedures adopted (eg standards, blanks, duplicates, external laboratory checks) and whether acceptable levels of accuracy (ie lack of bias) and precision have been established.\nJinnings (Kalgoorlie) were used for all analysis of drill samples submitted by Riversgold. The laboratory techniques below are for all samples submitted to Jinnings and are considered appropriate for the style of mineralisation defined within the Northern Zone Project area:\nSamples above 3Kg were riffle split.\nPulverise to 95% passing 75 microns\n50-gram Fire Assay (FA50A) - Au Duplicates, Standards and Blanks were used for external laboratory checks by RGL\nVerification of sampling and assaying\nThe verification of significant intersections by either independent or alternative company personnel.\nThe use of twinned holes.\nDocumentation of primary data, data entry procedures, data verification, data storage (physical and electronic) protocols.\nDiscuss any adjustment to assay data.\nIntercepts were reviewed by 2 company personnel.\nLocation of data points\nAccuracy and quality of surveys used to locate drill holes (collar and down-hole surveys), trenches, mine workings and other locations used in Mineral Resource estimation.\nSpecification of the grid system used.\nQuality and adequacy of topographic control.\nThe collar position of each hole has been marked out with a Garmin Inreach Explorer+ hand held GPS, and will be picked up by Spectrum Surveys (Kalgoorlie) using a DGPS.\nData spacing and distribution\nData spacing for reporting of Exploration Results.\nWhether the data spacing and distribution is sufficient to establish the degree of geological and grade continuity appropriate for the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimation procedure(s) and classifications applied.\nWhether sample compositing has been applied.\nThe holes were drilled on a nominal Northeast-Southwest 20m spacing on traverses 15-20m apart.\nOrientation of data in relation to geological structure\nWhether the orientation of sampling achieves unbiased sampling of possible structures and the extent to which this is known, considering the deposit type.\nIf the relationship between the drilling orientation and the orientation of key mineralised structures is considered to have introduced a sampling bias, this should be assessed and reported if material.\nBased on logging of diamond core the drill holes appear to be orientated perpendicular to strike and dip of the main mineralised structures.\nAn interpreted fault though the middle of the mineralisation may have caused some displacement.\nSample security\nThe measures taken to ensure sample security.\nCompany personnel delivered samples to Jinnings Kalgoorlie where they were submitted for assay.\nAudits or reviews\nThe results of any audits or reviews of sampling techniques and data.\nData reviews will be conducted on completion of further drilling\nSection 2: Reporting of Exploration Results\n(Criteria listed in the preceding section also apply to this section)\nCriteria\nJORC Code explanation\nCommentary\nMineral tenement and land tenure status\nType, reference name/number, location and ownership including agreements or material issues with third parties such as joint ventures, partnerships, overriding royalties, native title interests, historical sites, wilderness or national park and environmental settings.\nThe security of the tenure held at the time of reporting along with any known impediments to obtaining a licence to operate in the area.\nThe Northern Zone Project is comprised of one granted prospecting licence (P25/2651) which covers an area of 82 hectares, and is held in the name of Riversgold (Australia) Pty Ltd 80/100, Oracle Gold (WA) Pty Ltd 20/100.\nThe JV documents are to be formalised by December 2025. Oracle will be required to contribute pro-rata or dilute.\nExploration done by other parties\nAcknowledgment and appraisal of exploration by other parties.\nThe majority of previous exploration in the area was by Northern Mining during 2007 to 2012 under the Blair North project, multiple small resource areas were identified at the George's Reward area to the south of P25/2651. Numerous gold intersections were recorded.\nGeology\nDeposit type, geological setting and style of mineralisation.\nThe deposit sought is (Intrusion Related Gold System (IRGS) style of mineral deposit.\nNorthern Zone is hosted within a porphyry unit (Tonalite- Trondhjemite Intrusion, TTI), with high background gold and horizontal gold mineralised units within the TTI unit. The Northern Zone Project sits within the Canon Shear or fault zone, with further drilling required to define the limits of mineralisation identified to date.\nDrill hole Information\nA summary of all information material to the understanding of the exploration results including a tabulation of the following information for all Material drill holes:\neasting and northing of the drill hole collar\nelevation or RL (Reduced Level - elevation above sea level in metres) of the drill hole collar\ndip and azimuth of the hole\ndown hole length and interception depth\nhole length.\nIf the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis that the information is not Material and this exclusion does not detract from the understanding of the report, the Competent Person should clearly explain why this is the case.\nRefer to Tables and Figures within the body of the release.\nData aggregation methods\nIn reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques, maximum and/or minimum grade truncations (eg cutting of high grades) and cut-off grades are usually Material and should be stated.\nWhere aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high-grade results and longer lengths of low-grade results, the procedure used for such aggregation should be stated and some typical examples of such aggregations should be shown in detail.\nThe assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent values should be clearly stated.\nIntersections are weighted average grades based on a 0.001 g/t Au cut-off with unlimited waste zones but with a targeted grade of 0.4-0.6g/t Au.\nRelationship between mineralisation widths and intercept lengths\nThese relationships are particularly important in the reporting of Exploration Results.\nIf the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill hole angle is known, its nature should be reported.\nIf it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported, there should be a clear statement to this effect (eg 'down hole length, true width not known').\nThe diamond drilling program in 2023 confirmed the apparent widths of mineralisation as being perpendicular to foliation and veining. Step out RC drilling to be the same as the diamond drilling. Mineralisation has been determined from structural logging to be horizontal and vertical drilling is therefore true width drilling.\nDiagrams\nAppropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of intercepts should be included for any significant discovery being reported These should include, but not be limited to a plan view of drill hole collar locations and appropriate sectional views.\nSee body of the announcement for relevant diagrams and photos.\nBalanced reporting\nWhere comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not practicable, representative reporting of both low and high grades and/or widths should be practiced to avoid misleading reporting of Exploration Results.\nThe reporting of exploration results is considered balanced by the competent person.\nOther substantive exploration data\nOther exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be reported including (but not limited to): geological observations; geophysical survey results; geochemical survey results; bulk samples - size and method of treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk density, groundwater, geotechnical and rock characteristics; potential deleterious or contaminating substances.\nSee body of the announcement.\nFurther work\nThe nature and scale of planned further work (eg tests for lateral extensions or depth extensions or large-scale step-out drilling).\nDiagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible extensions, including the main geological interpretations and future drilling areas, provided this information is not commercially sensitive.\n\u00b7\nFollow up phases of drilling to further test strike to be undertaken.\n\u00b7\nComplete a maiden MRE\n[2]\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The values from selected drill holes are given in Tables 1-3 and in\nFigure 2\n. Results from a further 16 drillholes are anticipated to be received shortly.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nThe drilling programme has continued to intersect shallow gold mineralisation as drilling expands the gold footprint at the Northern Zone Gold Project.\n\u00b7\nFirst assay results now arriving for 2026, with significant results, including:\n\u00b7\n8m @ 5.81 g/t Au from 46m (NZAC179)\n\u00b7\n7m @ 3.48 g/t Au from 48m (NZAC181)\n\u00b7\n5m @ 3.13 g/t Au from 41m (NZAC170)\n\u00b7\n4m @ 2.28 g/t Au from 43m (NZAC182)\n\u00b7\nFurther significant results shown in tables below\n\u00b7\nDrilling results from a further 16 drillholes due to be received in two batches over the coming weeks.\n\u00b7\nDrill rig booked for 10 February aiming to continue expanding the oxide gold mineralisation footprint.\n\u00b7\nConversion to Mining Lease process continues with the Heritage Agreement a major step forward.\n[1]\n\u00b7\nThe Mine Development and Closure Plan (MDCP) and the associated environmental assessments have commenced with Resource WA.\nNaheed Memon, CEO of Oracle, commented\n:\n\"It is great to follow on from previous announcements and continue to expand and intersect gold grades in the northeast area and expand the saddle area. We believe these results are very impressive and add significant upside to the project for our plans with our partners for gold production targeted for later this year. Our modelling suggests that this could constitute part of a ~600m wide zone of shallow oxide mineralisation overlying the Northern Zone porphyry system.\n\"Oracle also notes from Riversgold's news release on the ASX today that MEGA Resources has become a shareholder of Riversgold, and we see this as highly promising for the JV partnership going forward.\n\"We are still awaiting results from 16 drillholes, expected in the coming weeks, and we are looking forward to the assays that will be from the northeast and saddle areas.\n\"The two recently completed drill programmes were designed to add to our gold footprint in the top 50-60m at our Kalgoorlie Gold Project, and to enhance the MEGA Resources mining scenario for 2026\n[2]\n. Results continue to expand the lateral footprint of Northern Zone and we are achieving the goal of making the project bigger in the oxide zone. I look forward to updating shareholders as we progress the project.\"\nThe latest drill programme results (\nTables 1-3\n) continue to successfully intersect the mineralised host porphyry over an increasing footprint and consistently validate the broader gold mineralisation model. Gold mineralisation has been successfully intersected in the northeast area, with a section of drill holes to the north of an existing single line, expanding the gold mineralisation footprint (\nFigure 2\n). More drill results from the saddle area between the west and east zones is filling in nicely, with a further 12 holes due shortly. A key SW-NE cross-section derived from 3D Leapfrog software is illustrated in\nFigure 3.\nThe interpretation illustrates gold grade shells derived from all the significant intercepts reported by Riversgold to April 2025. The Leapfrog model will be updated once all pending assays are received.\nNorthern Zone is hosted within a porphyry unit (Tonalite- Trondhjemite Intrusion, TTI), with high background gold and horizontal gold mineralised units within the TTI unit. The Northern Zone Project sits within the Canon Shear or fault zone, with further drilling required to define the limits of mineralisation identified to date. The horizontal mineralisation makes drilling to date perpendicular to the gold mineralisation, and no water in drilling to a depth of 60 metres makes the TTI also suitable for drilling with the techniques the Company has utilised to date.\nRiversgold will continue advancing its understanding of the Kalgoorlie Project before proceeding with a maiden Mineral Resource Estimate (\nMRE\n), but this drilling will be used by Mega Resources in their mine planning for our joint plans to start mining in the first half of 2026.\nFor further information on Oracle, visit the Company\n'\ns website at\nhttp://www.oraclepower.co.uk\nor contact\n:\nOracle Power PLC\nNaheed Memon - CEO +44 (0) 203 580 4314\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser & Broker)\nRory Murphy, Matthew Chandler, Rob Patrick +44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nSt Brides Partners Limited (Financial PR)\nSusie Geliher, Will Turner +44 (0) 20 7236 1177\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of EU Regulation No. 596/2014, which forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended by virtue of the Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019.\nCompetent Person\n'\ns Statement\nThe information in this announcement that relates to exploration results, exploration targets, mineral resources or ore reserves is based on information compiled by Mr Edward Mead, who is a Fellow of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy.

2: JORC INFORMATION\nThe following Tables are provided to ensure compliance with the JORC Code (2012 Edition) requirements for the reporting of Exploration Results at Northern Zone.\nSection 1: Sampling Techniques and Data\n(Criteria in this section applies to all succeeding sections)\nCriteria\nJORC Code explanation\nCommentary\nSampling techniques\nNature and quality of sampling (eg cut channels, random chips, or specific specialised industry standard measurement tools appropriate to the minerals under investigation, such as down hole gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc). These examples should not be taken as limiting the broad meaning of sampling.\nInclude reference to measures taken to ensure sample representivity and the appropriate calibration of any measurement tools or systems used.\nAspects of the determination of mineralisation that are Material to the Public Report.\nIn cases where 'industry standard' work has been done this would be relatively simple (eg 'reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg was pulverised to produce a 30 g charge for fire assay'). In other cases, more explanation may be required, such as where there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling problems. Unusual commodities or mineralisation types (eg submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed information.\nEvery metre drilled was placed on the ground.\n6m composites were collected using a scoop method of sampling the coarse reject sample for the first 24m.\n1m sampling using a rifle splitter was trialed on the clays, from 24m, with sampling deemed to create a high degree risk of smearing. The clays are not wet, but have a damp characteristic. A large metal scoop was used to sample between 70-90% of material from each metre drilled, to total between 2-3kg samples.\nStandard reference material, sample duplicates and blanks, were undertaken at 25m sample intervals.\nSamples were sent to the laboratory for crushing, splitting and analysis.\nAnalysis was undertaken by Jinnings laboratories (Kalgoorlie) for gold assay by 50g fire assay.\nDrilling techniques\nDrill type (eg core, reverse circulation, open-hole hammer, rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, sonic, etc) and details (eg core diameter, triple or standard tube, depth of diamond tails, face-sampling bit or other type, whether core is oriented and if so, by what method, etc).\nAustralian Surface Drilling completed the program using a face sampling hammer on an Atlas Copco grade control rig.\nDrill sample recovery\nMethod of recording and assessing core and chip sample recoveries and results assessed.\nMeasures taken to maximise sample recovery and ensure representative nature of the samples.\nWhether a relationship exists between sample recovery and grade and whether sample bias may have occurred due to preferential loss/gain of fine/coarse material.\nDrill recovery was routinely recorded via estimation of the comparative percentage of the volume of the sample bag by the company geologist.\nThe sample recovery was deemed excellent for representative assays.\nThe cyclone was cleaned or checked every 6m.\nLogging\nWhether core and chip samples have been geologically and geotechnically logged to a level of detail to support appropriate Mineral Resource estimation, mining studies and metallurgical studies.\nWhether logging is qualitative or quantitative in nature. Core (or costean, channel, etc) photography.\nThe total length and percentage of the relevant intersections logged.\nAll holes have been geologically logged for lithology, mineralisation and weathering. As well as whether dry, damp or wet.\nLogging is quantitative for presence of quartz veins. All other logging is qualitative.\nA brief description of each drilling sample was recorded and a permanent record has been collected and stored in chip trays for reference.\nSub-sampling techniques and sample preparation\nIf core, whether cut or sawn and whether quarter, half or all core taken.\nIf non-core, whether riffled, tube sampled, rotary split, etc and whether sampled wet or dry.\nFor all sample types, the nature, quality and appropriateness of the sample preparation technique.\nQuality control procedures adopted for all sub-sampling stages to maximise representivity of samples.\nMeasures taken to ensure that the sampling is representative of the in-situ material collected, including for instance results for field duplicate/second-half sampling.\nWhether sample sizes are appropriate to the grain size of the material being sampled.\n1m sampling using a rifle splitter was trialed on the clays, from 24m, with sampling deemed to create a high degree risk of smearing. The clays are not wet, but have a damp characteristic. A large metal scoop was used to sample between 70-90% of material from each metre drilled, to total between 2-3kg samples.\nStandard reference material, sample duplicates and blanks, were undertaken at 25m sample intervals.\nSamples were sent to the laboratory for crushing, splitting and analysis.\nThe use of fire assay with 50g charge for all AC drilling provides a level of confidence in the assay database. The sampling and assaying are considered representative of the in-situ material.\nThe sample size of 2-3 kilograms is appropriate and representative of the grain size and mineralisation style of the deposit.\nQuality of assay data and laboratory tests\nThe nature, quality and appropriateness of the assaying and laboratory procedures used and whether the technique is considered partial or total.\nFor geophysical tools, spectrometers, handheld XRF instruments, etc, the parameters used in determining the analysis including instrument make and model, reading times, calibrations factors applied and their derivation, etc.\nNature of quality control procedures adopted (eg standards, blanks, duplicates, external laboratory checks) and whether acceptable levels of accuracy (ie lack of bias) and precision have been established.\nJinnings (Kalgoorlie) were used for all analysis of drill samples submitted by Riversgold. The laboratory techniques below are for all samples submitted to Jinnings and are considered appropriate for the style of mineralisation defined within the Northern Zone Project area:\nSamples above 3Kg were riffle split.\nPulverise to 95% passing 75 microns\n50-gram Fire Assay (FA50A) - Au Duplicates, Standards and Blanks were used for external laboratory checks by RGL\nVerification of sampling and assaying\nThe verification of significant intersections by either independent or alternative company personnel.\nThe use of twinned holes.\nDocumentation of primary data, data entry procedures, data verification, data storage (physical and electronic) protocols.\nDiscuss any adjustment to assay data.\nIntercepts were reviewed by 2 company personnel.\nLocation of data points\nAccuracy and quality of surveys used to locate drill holes (collar and down-hole surveys), trenches, mine workings and other locations used in Mineral Resource estimation.\nSpecification of the grid system used.\nQuality and adequacy of topographic control.\nThe collar position of each hole has been marked out with a Garmin Inreach Explorer+ hand held GPS, and will be picked up by Spectrum Surveys (Kalgoorlie) using a DGPS.\nData spacing and distribution\nData spacing for reporting of Exploration Results.\nWhether the data spacing and distribution is sufficient to establish the degree of geological and grade continuity appropriate for the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimation procedure(s) and classifications applied.\nWhether sample compositing has been applied.\nThe holes were drilled on a nominal Northeast-Southwest 20m spacing on traverses 15-20m apart.\nOrientation of data in relation to geological structure\nWhether the orientation of sampling achieves unbiased sampling of possible structures and the extent to which this is known, considering the deposit type.\nIf the relationship between the drilling orientation and the orientation of key mineralised structures is considered to have introduced a sampling bias, this should be assessed and reported if material.\nBased on logging of diamond core the drill holes appear to be orientated perpendicular to strike and dip of the main mineralised structures.\nAn interpreted fault though the middle of the mineralisation may have caused some displacement.\nSample security\nThe measures taken to ensure sample security.\nCompany personnel delivered samples to Jinnings Kalgoorlie where they were submitted for assay.\nAudits or reviews\nThe results of any audits or reviews of sampling techniques and data.\nData reviews will be conducted on completion of further drilling\nSection 2: Reporting of Exploration Results\n(Criteria listed in the preceding section also apply to this section)\nCriteria\nJORC Code explanation\nCommentary\nMineral tenement and land tenure status\nType, reference name/number, location and ownership including agreements or material issues with third parties such as joint ventures, partnerships, overriding royalties, native title interests, historical sites, wilderness or national park and environmental settings.\nThe security of the tenure held at the time of reporting along with any known impediments to obtaining a licence to operate in the area.\nThe Northern Zone Project is comprised of one granted prospecting licence (P25/2651) which covers an area of 82 hectares, and is held in the name of Riversgold (Australia) Pty Ltd 80/100, Oracle Gold (WA) Pty Ltd 20/100.\nThe JV documents are to be formalised by December 2025. Oracle will be required to contribute pro-rata or dilute.\nExploration done by other parties\nAcknowledgment and appraisal of exploration by other parties.\nThe majority of previous exploration in the area was by Northern Mining during 2007 to 2012 under the Blair North project, multiple small resource areas were identified at the George's Reward area to the south of P25/2651. Numerous gold intersections were recorded.\nGeology\nDeposit type, geological setting and style of mineralisation.\nThe deposit sought is (Intrusion Related Gold System (IRGS) style of mineral deposit.\nNorthern Zone is hosted within a porphyry unit (Tonalite- Trondhjemite Intrusion, TTI), with high background gold and horizontal gold mineralised units within the TTI unit. The Northern Zone Project sits within the Canon Shear or fault zone, with further drilling required to define the limits of mineralisation identified to date.\nDrill hole Information\nA summary of all information material to the understanding of the exploration results including a tabulation of the following information for all Material drill holes:\neasting and northing of the drill hole collar\nelevation or RL (Reduced Level - elevation above sea level in metres) of the drill hole collar\ndip and azimuth of the hole\ndown hole length and interception depth\nhole length.\nIf the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis that the information is not Material and this exclusion does not detract from the understanding of the report, the Competent Person should clearly explain why this is the case.\nRefer to Tables and Figures within the body of the release.\nData aggregation methods\nIn reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques, maximum and/or minimum grade truncations (eg cutting of high grades) and cut-off grades are usually Material and should be stated.\nWhere aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high-grade results and longer lengths of low-grade results, the procedure used for such aggregation should be stated and some typical examples of such aggregations should be shown in detail.\nThe assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent values should be clearly stated.\nIntersections are weighted average grades based on a 0.001 g/t Au cut-off with unlimited waste zones but with a targeted grade of 0.4-0.6g/t Au.\nRelationship between mineralisation widths and intercept lengths\nThese relationships are particularly important in the reporting of Exploration Results.\nIf the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill hole angle is known, its nature should be reported.\nIf it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported, there should be a clear statement to this effect (eg 'down hole length, true width not known').\nThe diamond drilling program in 2023 confirmed the apparent widths of mineralisation as being perpendicular to foliation and veining. Step out RC drilling to be the same as the diamond drilling. Mineralisation has been determined from structural logging to be horizontal and vertical drilling is therefore true width drilling.\nDiagrams\nAppropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of intercepts should be included for any significant discovery being reported These should include, but not be limited to a plan view of drill hole collar locations and appropriate sectional views.\nSee body of the announcement for relevant diagrams and photos.\nBalanced reporting\nWhere comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not practicable, representative reporting of both low and high grades and/or widths should be practiced to avoid misleading reporting of Exploration Results.\nThe reporting of exploration results is considered balanced by the competent person.\nOther substantive exploration data\nOther exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be reported including (but not limited to): geological observations; geophysical survey results; geochemical survey results; bulk samples - size and method of treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk density, groundwater, geotechnical and rock characteristics; potential deleterious or contaminating substances.\nSee body of the announcement.\nFurther work\nThe nature and scale of planned further work (eg tests for lateral extensions or depth extensions or large-scale step-out drilling).\nDiagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible extensions, including the main geological interpretations and future drilling areas, provided this information is not commercially sensitive.\n\u00b7\nFollow up phases of drilling to further test strike to be undertaken.\n\u00b7\nComplete a maiden MRE\n[1]\nAnnouncement dated 23 December 2025 - \" Kalgoorlie Gold Project Native Title Agreements Signed\"\n[2]\nAnnouncement dated 30 September 2025 - \" Riversgold Signs Mining and Co-Operation Agreement for Northern Zone Gold Project Near Kalgoorlie\"\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

These agreements relate to tenements M25/389 and P25/2848 that cover the ground over the Company's Kalgoorlie Gold Project.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nImportant milestone achieved for the granting of a mining lease.\n\u00b7\nThe executed key agreements with the Marlinyu Ghoorlie Native Title Claimant Group cover the Northern Zone Gold Project (\"Northern Zone\"), and any surrounding project areas.\n\u00b7\nThe agreements set out protocols for heritage surveys, safeguards for site protection, and streamlined grant of mining lease tenure and clearance procedures for activities under Oracle and Riversgold's tenure.\n\u00b7\nOracle and Riversgold have signed a Right to Mine and Co-Operation Agreement with MEGA\nResources (MEGA).\n\u00b7\nMEGA will provide all development and mining funding for Northern Zone on a 50/50 profit share\nNaheed Memon, CEO of Oracle, commented\n:\n\"We are very pleased to have signed this very important set of agreements with the Marlinyu Ghoorlie. These landmark agreements reflect the Northern Zone Gold Project's owners' commitment to working in partnership with the Marlinyu Ghoorlie people in a spirit of goodwill and mutual respect. This is a major milestone towards the advancement of the project and a key part of what is needed to convert the tenements to a Mining Lease and our moves to open up Northern Zone to gold production in 2026 with MEGA.\"\nThese agreements provide a solid framework of cooperatively working together to identify and protect Aboriginal Cultural Heritage on the Northern Zone whilst allowing the Company to advance towards gold production with Mega in 2026.\nAbout the MEGA Resources Right to Mine and Co-Operation Agreement for gold production at Northern Zone:\nOn the 30 September 2025, Oracle announced that it had signed a binding Right to Mine and Co-Operation Agreement with MEGA Resources (MEGA) for the right to mine (the MEGA Agreement) with respect to its 20% owned Northern Zone Gold Project.\nUnder the MEGA Agreement, MEGA will pay 100% of the costs to develop and mine at Northern Zone, including paying for all ancillary activities (which incorporates haulage of material to the point of sale, maintenance of haul roads and processing costs).\nIn return for MEGA paying for all the upfront costs at Northern Zone, any profit generated from this partnership will be split 50% to MEGA and 50% to the Project Owners.\nIn May 2023, Oracle signed a farm-in agreement with Riversgold. Riversgold advised Oracle that it had exercised its option to own the 80% interest in the Northern Zone tenement in February 2025. Northern Zone is now owned by Riversgold 80% and Oracle 20%, and this did not change with the MEGA Agreement.\nFor further information on Oracle, visit the Company\n'\ns website at\nhttp://www.oraclepower.co.uk\nor contact\n:\nOracle Power PLC\nNaheed Memon - CEO +44 (0) 203 580 4314\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser & Broker)\nRory Murphy, Matthew Chandler, Rob Patrick +44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nSt Brides Partners Limited (Financial PR)\nSusie Geliher, Ana Ribeiro +44 (0) 20 7236 1177\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of EU Regulation No. 596/2014, which forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended by virtue of the Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019.\nFigure\n1\n:\nLocation of Northern Zone Gold Project in relation to the Kalgoorlie Golden Mile/Fimiston \"Super Pit\".\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Results from a further nine grade control drillholes are anticipated to be received shortly. Samples from 28 air core drillholes from the recently completed program have been submitted for assay, with results from all 37 drillholes expected to be received in batches over the next six weeks.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nRiversgold continues to keep intersecting shallow gold mineralisation at Northern Zone Project\n\u00b7\nAssay results from a further 6 drillholes have been received.\n\u00b7\nGold mineralisation now identified in the previously undrilled \"saddle\" between the eastern and northwestern mineralised zones.\n\u00b7\nSignificant results from the second batch of results include:\no\n5m at 3.09 g/t Au from 47m (NZAC152)\no\n6m at 0.72 g/t Au from 66m (end-of-hole) (NZAC152)\no\n6m at 0.65 g/t Au from 32m (NZAC153)\no\n1m at 11.0 g/t Au from 46m (NZAC153)\no\n8m at 0.62 g/t Au from 32m (NZAC154)\no\n2m at 1.47 g/t Au from 49m (NZAC155)\no\n7m at 1.58 g/t Au from 42m (NZAC156)\no\n2m at 1.32 g/t Au from 44m (NZAC157)\n\u00b7\n2025 drilling has now concluded with results from a further 37 drillholes due to be received in batches over the coming weeks.\nNaheed Memon, CEO of Oracle, commented\n:\n\"Intersecting these gold grades in the previously undrilled saddle area between the eastern and the northwestern shallow gold zones is highly significant as it demonstrates the potential for these two zones to join together. Our modelling suggests that this could constitute a ~600m wide zone of shallow oxide mineralisation overlying the Northern Zone porphyry system.\n\"We are still awaiting results from 9 drillholes from the grade control drill rig program, and 28 vertical air core drillholes from the drilling have just been submitted to the lab. With results from these 37 drillholes expected in the coming weeks, we are looking forward to a constant stream of news-flow leading into the New Year.\n\"The two recently completed drill programs were designed to add to the gold footprint in the top 50-60m at the Northern Zone Project, and to enhance the MEGA Resources mining scenario for 2026\n[1]\n. Results continue to expand the lateral footprint of Northern Zone and we are achieving the goal of making the Project bigger in the oxide zone. I look forward to updating shareholders as we progress the Project.\"\nThe latest drill programs (\nTables 1-3\n) continue to successfully intersect the mineralised host porphyry over an increasing footprint and consistently validate the broader gold mineralisation model. Gold mineralisation has been successfully intersected in a previously undrilled area referred to as the saddle with modelling suggests the potential of joining the northwestern and eastern mineralisation. The last drillhole on the eastern extension intersected significant gold mineralisation (see\nFigure 2\n), with the overall footprint expanding. A key SW-NE cross-section derived from 3D Leapfrog software is illustrated in\nFigure 3.\nThe interpretation illustrates gold grade shells derived from all the significant intercepts reported to April 2025. The Leapfrog model will be updated once all pending assays are received.\nNorthern Zone is hosted within a porphyry unit (Tonalite-Trondhjemite Intrusion, TTI), with high background gold and horizontal gold mineralised units within the TTI unit. The Northern Zone Project sits within the Canon Shear or fault zone, with further drilling required to define the limits of mineralisation identified to date. The horizontal mineralisation makes drilling to date perpendicular to the gold mineralisation, and no water in drilling to a depth of 60 metres makes the TTI also suitable for drilling with the techniques the Company has utilised to date.\nRiversgold will continue advancing its understanding of the Project before proceeding with a maiden Mineral Resource Estimate (\nMRE\n), but this drilling will be used by Mega Resources in their mine planning for our joint plans to start mining in the first half of 2026.\n**END**\nFor further information on Oracle, visit the Company\n'\ns website at\nhttp://www.oraclepower.co.uk\nor contact\n:\nOracle Power PLC\nNaheed Memon - CEO +44 (0) 203 580 4314\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser & Broker)\nRory Murphy, Matthew Chandler, Rob Patrick +44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nSt Brides Partners Limited (Financial PR)\nSusie Geliher, Isabel de Salis +44 (0) 20 7236 1177\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of EU Regulation No. 596/2014, which forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended by virtue of the Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019.\nCompetent Person\n'\ns Statement\nThe information in this announcement that relates to exploration results, exploration targets, mineral resources or ore reserves is based on information compiled by Mr Edward Mead, who is a Fellow of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy.

Step out RC drilling to be the same as the diamond drilling. Mineralisation has been determined from structural logging to be horizontal and vertical drilling is therefore true width drilling.\nDiagrams\nAppropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of intercepts should be included for any significant discovery being reported These should include, but not be limited to a plan view of drill hole collar locations and appropriate sectional views\n.\nSee body of the announcement for relevant diagrams and photos.\nBalanced reporting\nWhere comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not practicable, representative reporting of both low and high grades and/or widths should be practiced to avoid misleading reporting of Exploration Results.\nThe reporting of exploration results i\ns considered balanced by the competent person.\nOther substantive exploration data\nOther exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be reported including (but not limited to): geological observations; geophysical survey results; geochemical survey results; bulk samples - size and method of treatment; metallurgical test results;\nbulk density, groundwater, geotechnical and rock characteristics; potential deleterious or contaminating substances.\nSee body of the announcement.\nFurther work\nThe nature and scale of planned further work (eg tests for lateral extensions or depth extensions or large-scale step-out drilling).\nDiagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible extensions, including the main geological interpretations and future dr\nilling areas, provided this information is not commercially sensitive.\n\u00b7\nFollow up phases of drilling to further test strike to be undertaken.\n\u00b7\nComplete a maiden MRE\n[1]\nAnnouncement dated 30 September 2025 - \" Northern Zone Gold Project Co-operation Agreement\"\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

In addition, drilling is progressing on a new ~40-hole drilling\u00a0programme, with 12 holes completed to date.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nThe Company continues to expand the gold mineralisation footprint at the Northern Zone.\n\u00b7\nAssay results from the first six holes of a 21-hole programme have been received.\n\u00b7\nSignificant results from the first batch of results from pre-Christmas drilling include:\no\n9m @ 1.33 g/t Au from 56m, (NZAC146)\no\n3m @ 4.39 g/t Au from 45m, (NZAC149)\no\n3m @ 1.89 g/t Au from 48m, (NZAC150)\no\n5m @ 1.75 g/t Au from 61m (EOH), (NZAC150)\no\n4m @ 0.83 g/t Au from 47m,\n(NZAC151)\n\u00b7\nTargeted drilling continues, with the current campaign 12 holes into a further 40-hole programme with results to be reported in the next six to eight weeks.\nNaheed Memon, CEO of Oracle, commented\n:\n\"As highlighted before, we planned to undertake two drill programmes before the end of the year to add to our gold footprint in the top 50-60 metres at our Northern Zone gold project, and to enhance the MEGA Resources mining operations scenario for 2026. The results from this first batch of assay results continue to expand the lateral footprint of the Northern Zone and we continue to achieve the goal of making the project bigger in the oxide zone.\n\"Everything is going to plan as we expand the mineralised footprint of the Project and define the high-grade gold zone hosted within a large lower-grade porphyry host. The reported results continue to meet and exceed expectations, with the new high-grade zone being delineated on the eastern margin of the Project, now looking to move northwards.\n\"The second shallow drill programme is well underway with more samples now in for assay, and we expect to report these assay results over the next six to eight weeks.\"\nResults from the GC programme (Tables 1-3) continue to successfully intersect the mineralised host porphyry over an expanding footprint, consistently supporting the broader gold mineralisation model. Five drillholes on the eastern extension intersected significant gold mineralisation (see Figure 2), with the footprint expanding northwards. A key SW-NE cross-section derived from 3D Leapfrog software is illustrated in Figure 3\n.\nThe interpretation illustrates gold grade shells, derived from all the significant intercepts announced by the Company to April 2025. The Leapfrog model will be updated once all pending assays are received.\nNorthern Zone is hosted within a porphyry unit (Tonalite-Trondhjemite Intrusion, TTI), with high background gold and horizontal gold mineralised units within the TTI unit. The Northern Zone Project sits within the Canon Shear or fault zone, with further drilling required to define the limits of mineralisation identified to date. The horizontal mineralisation makes drilling to date perpendicular to the gold mineralisation, and no water in drilling to a depth of 60 metres makes the TTI also suitable for drilling with the techniques the Company has utilised to date.\nThe Northern Zone JV will continue advancing its understanding of the Kalgoorlie Project before proceeding with a maiden Mineral Resource Estimate (\nMRE\n), but this drilling will be used by Mega Resources in their mine planning for our joint plans to start mining in the first half of 2026.\n**ENDS**\nFor further information on Oracle, visit the Company\n'\ns website at\nhttp://www.oraclepower.co.uk\nor contact\n:\nOracle Power PLC\nNaheed Memon - CEO +44 (0) 203 580 4314\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser & Broker)\nRory Murphy, Matthew Chandler, Rob Patrick +44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nSt Brides Partners Limited (Financial PR)\nSusie Geliher, Isabel de Salis +44 (0) 20 7236 1177\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of EU Regulation No. 596/2014, which forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended by virtue of the Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019.\nCompetent Person\n'\ns Statement\nThe information in this announcement that relates to exploration results, exploration targets, mineral resources or ore reserves is based on information compiled by Mr Edward Mead, who is a Fellow of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy.

Oracle will be required to contribute pro-rata or dilute.\nExploration done by other parties\nAcknowledgment and appraisal of exploration by other parties.\nThe majority of previous exploration in the area was by Northern Mining during 2007 to 2012 under the Blair North project, multiple small resource areas were identified at the George's Reward area to the south of P25/2651. Numerous gold intersections were recorded.\nGeology\nDeposit type, geological setting and style of mineralisation.\nThe deposit sought is (Intrusion Related Gold System (IRGS) style of mineral deposit.\nNorthern Zone is hosted within a porphyry unit (Tonalite- Trondhjemite Intrusion, TTI), with high background gold and horizontal gold mineralised units within the TTI unit. The Northern Zone Project sits within the Canon Shear or fault zone, with further drilling required to define the limits of mineralisation identified to date.\nDrill hole Information\nA summary of all information material to the understanding of the exploration results including a tabulation of the following information for all Material drill holes:\neasting and northing of the drill hole collar\nelevation or RL (Reduced Level - elevation above sea level in metres) of the drill hole collar\ndip and azimuth of the hole\ndown hole length and interception depth\nhole length.\nIf the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis that the information is not Material and this exclusion does not detract from the understanding of the report, the Competent Person should clearly explain why this is the case.\nRefer to Tables and Figures within the body of the release.\nData aggregation methods\nIn reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques, maximum and/or minimum grade truncations (eg cutting of high grades) and cut-off grades are usually Material and should be stated.\nWhere aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high-grade results and longer lengths of low-grade results, the procedure used for such aggregation should be stated and some typical examples of such aggregations should be shown in detail.\nThe assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent values should be clearly stated.\nIntersections are weighted average grades based on a 0.001 g/t Au cut-off with unlimited waste zones but with a targeted grade of 0.4-0.6g/t Au.\nRelationship between mineralisation widths and intercept lengths\nThese relationships are particularly important in the reporting of Exploration Results.\nIf the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill hole angle is known, its nature should be reported.\nIf it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported, there should be a clear statement to this effect (eg 'down hole length, true width not known').\nThe diamond drilling program in 2023 confirmed the apparent widths of mineralisation as being perpendicular to foliation and veining. Step out RC drilling to be the same as the diamond drilling. Mineralisation has been determined from structural logging to be horizontal and vertical drilling is therefore true width drilling.\nDiagrams\nAppropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of intercepts should be included for any significant discovery being reported These should include, but not be limited to a plan view of drill hole collar locations and appropriate sectional views.\nSee body of the announcement for relevant diagrams and photos.\nBalanced reporting\nWhere comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not practicable, representative reporting of both low and high grades and/or widths should be practiced to avoid misleading reporting of Exploration Results.\nThe reporting of exploration results is considered balanced by the competent person.\nOther substantive exploration data\nOther exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be reported including (but not limited to): geological observations; geophysical survey results; geochemical survey results; bulk samples - size and method of treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk density, groundwater, geotechnical and rock characteristics; potential deleterious or contaminating substances.\nSee body of the announcement.\nFurther work\nThe nature and scale of planned further work (eg tests for lateral extensions or depth extensions or large-scale step-out drilling).\nDiagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible extensions, including the main geological interpretations and future drilling areas, provided this information is not commercially sensitive.\n\u00b7\nFollow up phases of drilling to further test strike to be undertaken.\n\u00b7\nComplete a maiden MRE\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Results from a further nine grade control drillholes are anticipated to be received shortly.

Our modelling suggests that this could constitute a ~600m wide zone of shallow oxide mineralisation overlying the Northern Zone porphyry system.\n\"We are still awaiting results from 9 drillholes from the grade control drill rig program, and 28 vertical air core drillholes from the drilling have just been submitted to the lab. With results from these 37 drillholes expected in the coming weeks, we are looking forward to a constant stream of news-flow leading into the New Year.\n\"The two recently completed drill programs were designed to add to the gold footprint in the top 50-60m at the Northern Zone Project, and to enhance the MEGA Resources mining scenario for 2026\n[1]\n. Results continue to expand the lateral footprint of Northern Zone and we are achieving the goal of making the Project bigger in the oxide zone. I look forward to updating shareholders as we progress the Project.\"\nThe latest drill programs (\nTables 1-3\n) continue to successfully intersect the mineralised host porphyry over an increasing footprint and consistently validate the broader gold mineralisation model. Gold mineralisation has been successfully intersected in a previously undrilled area referred to as the saddle with modelling suggests the potential of joining the northwestern and eastern mineralisation. The last drillhole on the eastern extension intersected significant gold mineralisation (see\nFigure 2\n), with the overall footprint expanding. A key SW-NE cross-section derived from 3D Leapfrog software is illustrated in\nFigure 3.\nThe interpretation illustrates gold grade shells derived from all the significant intercepts reported to April 2025. The Leapfrog model will be updated once all pending assays are received.\nNorthern Zone is hosted within a porphyry unit (Tonalite-Trondhjemite Intrusion, TTI), with high background gold and horizontal gold mineralised units within the TTI unit. The Northern Zone Project sits within the Canon Shear or fault zone, with further drilling required to define the limits of mineralisation identified to date. The horizontal mineralisation makes drilling to date perpendicular to the gold mineralisation, and no water in drilling to a depth of 60 metres makes the TTI also suitable for drilling with the techniques the Company has utilised to date.\nRiversgold will continue advancing its understanding of the Project before proceeding with a maiden Mineral Resource Estimate (\nMRE\n), but this drilling will be used by Mega Resources in their mine planning for our joint plans to start mining in the first half of 2026.\n**END**\nFor further information on Oracle, visit the Company\n'\ns website at\nhttp://www.oraclepower.co.uk\nor contact\n:\nOracle Power PLC\nNaheed Memon - CEO +44 (0) 203 580 4314\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser & Broker)\nRory Murphy, Matthew Chandler, Rob Patrick +44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nSt Brides Partners Limited (Financial PR)\nSusie Geliher, Isabel de Salis +44 (0) 20 7236 1177\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of EU Regulation No. 596/2014, which forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of th",

In addition, drilling is progressing on a new ~40-hole drilling\u00a0programme, with 12 holes completed to date.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nThe Company continues to expand the gold mineralisation footprint at the Northern Zone.\n\u00b7\nAssay results from the first six holes of a 21-hole programme have been received.\n\u00b7\nSignificant results from the first batch of results from pre-Christmas drilling include:\no\n9m @ 1.33 g/t Au from 56m, (NZAC146)\no\n3m @ 4.39 g/t Au from 45m, (NZAC149)\no\n3m @ 1.89 g/t Au from 48m, (NZAC150)\no\n5m @ 1.75 g/t Au from 61m (EOH), (NZAC150)\no\n4m @ 0.83 g/t Au from 47m,\n(NZAC151)\n\u00b7\nTargeted drilling continues, with the current campaign 12 holes into a further 40-hole programme with results to be reported in the next six to eight weeks.\nNaheed Memon, CEO of Oracle, commented\n:\n\"As highlighted before, we planned to undertake two drill programmes before the end of the year to add to our gold footprint in the top 50-60 metres at our Northern Zone gold project, and to enhance the MEGA Resources mining operations scenario for 2026. The results from this first batch of assay results continue to expand the lateral footprint of the Northern Zone and we continue to achieve the goal of making the project bigger in the oxide zone.\n\"Everything is going to plan as we expand the mineralised footprint of the Project and define the high-grade gold zone hosted within a large lower-grade porphyry host. The reported results continue to meet and exceed expectations, with the new high-grade zone being delineated on the eastern margin of the Project, now looking to move northwards.\n\"The second shallow drill programme is well underway with more samples now in for assay, and we expect to report these assay results over the next six to eight weeks.\"\nResults from the GC programme (Tables 1-3) continue to successfully intersect the mineralised host porphyry over an expanding footprint, consistently supporting the broader gold mineralisation model. Five drillholes on the eastern extension intersected significant gold mineralisation (see Figure 2), with the footprint expanding northwards. A key SW-NE cross-section derived from 3D Leapfrog software is illustrated in Figure 3\n.\nThe interpretation illustrates gold grade shells, derived from all the significant intercepts announced by the Company to April 2025. The Leapfrog model will be updated once all pending assays are received.\nNorthern Zone is hosted within a porphyry unit (Tonalite-Trondhjemite Intrusion, TTI), with high background gold and horizontal gold mineralised units within the TTI unit. The Northern Zone Project sits within the Canon Shear or fault zone, with further drilling required to define the limits of mineralisation identified to date. The horizontal mineralisation makes drilling to date perpendicular to the gold mineralisation, and no water in drilling to a depth of 60 metres makes the TTI also suitable for drilling with the techniques the Company has utilised to date.\nThe Northern Zone JV will continue advancing its understanding of the Kalgoorlie Project before proceeding with a maiden Mineral Resource Estimate (\nMRE\n), but this drilling will be used by Mega Resources in their mine planning for our joint plans to start mining in the first half of 2026.\n**ENDS**\nFor further information on Oracle, visit the Company\n'\ns website at\nhttp://www.oraclepower.co.uk\nor contact\n:\nOracle Power PLC\nNaheed Memon - CEO +44 (0) 203 580 4314\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser & Broker)\nRory Murphy, Matthew Chandler, Rob Patrick +44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nSt Brides Partners Limited (Financial PR)\nSusie Geliher, Isabel de Salis +44 (0) 20 7236 1177\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of EU Regulation No. 596/2014, which forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended by virtue of the Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019.\nCompetent Person\n'\ns Statement\nThe information in this announcement that relates to exploration results, exploration targets, mineral resources or ore reserves is based on information compiled by Mr Edward Mead, who is a Fellow of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy.

Given that the Company is a resource development company a loss is expected. Without any current revenue, the Company continues to finance the development of its projects by raising new equity capital via the public markets and successfully raised \u00a3318,600 before expenses in April 2025 and a further \u00a3500,000 before expenses, post the period end, in August 2025.\nIt is pleasing to report that all the Company's three major projects continue to advance and move forward, with particularly good progress being made at the Northern Zone Project in Australia, where application has now been made to convert the prospecting licence into a mining licence. Additionally, our partner, Australian listed Riversgold Limited, continues to manage an ongoing drilling programme and we are currently working on formalising a joint venture agreement with them.\nAlso in Australia, we commenced work on the Blue Rock Valley Copper and Silver Project, located in the Ashburton Basin in north-west Western Australia. The initial work involved a maiden geochemical sampling programme which identified a 320m priority target zone over the main working area, and work will continue here during the year.\nIn Pakistan, we continue to work with our various partners and prospective investors for the development of the Green Hydrogen Project and we were very pleased that the LOI granted by the Government of Sindh, for the development of the large renewable energy power plant in Jhimpir, Sindh Province was extended until May 2026, based upon the significant of progress achieved on the project to date.\nPost the period end, the Company's growing recognition in the green energy space in Pakistan was recognised as our CEO, Naheed Memon, was appointed as a member of Pakistan's National Hydrogen Working Group, which has been established by the Pakistan Ministry of Planning, Development & Special Initiatives to develop a long-term national hydrogen strategy.\nFurther details on the developments of the Company's projects are set out in the CEO's statement.\nDavid Hutchins\nNon-executive Chairman\nChief Executive Officer\n'\ns statement for the six months ended 30 June 2025\nIn the first half of 2025, we have made good progress in relation to the development of our projects in Pakistan and Western Australia.\nReview of operations\nPakistan\nGreen Hydrogen and Renewable Power Project\nDuring the first half of 2025, we obtained an extension of the LOI granted by the Government of Sindh, for the development of the renewable energy power plant (\"Renewable Power Plant\"). This LOI allows for the development of a large renewable energy power plant in Jhimpir, Sindh Province in Pakistan. The LOI for this project has now been extended to 13 May 2026. The approval was granted based on the significant progress achieved on the project to date.\nAs part of its ongoing commitment CET, which is a subsidiary of State Grid Corporation of China, extended the JDA/MOU with Oracle to 1 March 2027, allowing for an additional two years for the joint development of the Company's green hydrogen project (the \"Green Hydrogen Project\") with an emphasis on technical and financial aspects. The MOU which is focused on accelerating the development of Oracle s Green Hydrogen Project, includes the construction of a hybrid renewable energy production and storage facility, combining 800MW of solar and 500MW of wind power, and battery storage.\nDuring the period, the Company also continued to engage with prospective investors for the development of the Green Hydrogen Project. Post period we have received significant interest from the Government of Pakistan, which includes the membership of a green hydrogen working group constituted by the Government of Pakistan, for the development of green molecule projects in Pakistan.\nThar Block VI\nIn the first half of 2025, we have been actively pursuing options for this asset which includes the potential divestment of the block and we are currently having a dialogue with prospective investors.\nAustralia\nNorthern Zone Gold Project\nThe first half of 2025 has been instrumental in the development of the Northern Zone Project (the \"Northern Zone\"), moving it towards a prospective mine. In February 2025, a mining lease application was submitted to the Department of Energy, Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety (\"DEMIRS\") in Australia. This applicat",

This follows the positive results from the maiden geochemical sampling programme announced on 4 July 2025. The programme highlighted number of strong anomalies across the Project over a strike of ~2km, which remains open. The Project is located in the Ashburton Basin, in the northwest region of Western Australia (Refer to Figure 1 below for location).\nHighlights\n:\no\nGeochemical sampling to be expanded to the\nnorthwest of outcropping copper mineralisation and the anomalies identified by the successful maiden geochemical sampling programme.\no\nThe geochemical responses to the northwest appear stronger and occur through colluvial cover.\no\nA quote for Mobile MT geophysical survey has been requested to test Blue Rocks for structurally hosted copper and gold.\nRecent successes by companies utilising Expert Geophysics Limited's Mobile MT system for copper and gold exploration - for structurally hosted deposits- has delineated mineralised fluid pathways and successful discoveries. The Company views this as applicable to the Project and has therefore has requested a quote for a Mobile MT survey.\nThe Company will also expand the geochemical sampling programme to infill and test further northwest of the maiden programme (as considered in the Company's announcement on 4 July 2025). This approach is expected to refine drill targets ahead of future exploration phases (Refer Figures 2, 3 and 4, with gravity, magnetics and air photo as basemap).\nNaheed Memon, CEO of Oracle, commented\n:\n\"I\nt is g\nreat\nto\nformulate\na solid exploration plan\nto follow up on the\nmaiden geochemical sampling program\nme\nat Blue Rocks\n, where\nanomalies related well to known mineralisation, with new zones identified to the northwest. The northwest will be focused on with planned infill and extension geochemical sampling programme. To cover the trend, a quote for Mobile MT, an airborne geophysical technique, has been requested and this may be successful at delineating fluid pathways associated with high-grade copper mineralisation\n.

Gravity data appears to relate to general geology, and magnetics does not show any correlation. The next steps to define mineralisation need to be considered, with expansion of geochemical sampling to the North East, over the major crustal suture and towards higher magnetics, and/or further geophysical techniques such as Expert Geophysics MobileMT drone based system. Drilling to test the anomalies can also be considered, with drill traverses proposed.\nConclusions:\no\nThe geochemical sampling programme has defined the mineralised system at Blue Rock trending NW-SE over the survey length of ~2km.\no\nThe responses to the NW appear stronger and are occurring through colluvial cover, whilst to the SE responses are weaker in near outcrop conditions.\no\nThe priority target zone extents for approximately 320m centred on the existing workings.\no\nThe secondary priority zone then extends to the NW for ~400m to the edge of the sampling grid.\no\nThe reconnaissance sampling lines indicate the mineralised trend is open to the NW under cover.\no\nFurther sampling will be required to determine the strike extent and potential of the system.\no\nThe VTEM targets to the west are unlikely to be related to mineralisation based on the lack of response on the reconnaissance lines.\no\nIf drilling were to be considered, it is suggested 2-3 section traverses NW of workings, with one to the SE of workings will define potential of immediate area of the workings.\no\nTwo reconnaissance drill traverses should be completed: first ~400m NW of workings testing for extensions and the second ~800m NW of workings testing the strong multi-element geochemical response.\nNaheed Memon, CEO of Oracle, commented\n:\n\"I\nt is great to get\nfinal results from the maiden geochemical sampling program\nme\nat Blue Rocks with\nanomalies relating well to known mineralisation, with new zones identified to the northwest and southeast of the main working area, that is 320m in strike. Anomalies have been highlighted over the ~2km strike of current work, with drill traverses designed to test the anomalies, with regulatory and heritage approvals required. Next steps are being considered, either to expand geochemical sampling, further geophysics or drill test\n. I look forward to updating shareholders in due course\nas we continue work advancing this project.\"\nAbout Blue Rock Valley Copper and Silver Project\n:\nThe Project Tenement\n:\nThe Project tenement (the \"Tenement\") covers 32 Blocks (approximately 102km2) (\nFigure 1\n) and is composed of one granted exploration licence, E08/3604. Oracle announced on 11 June 2024 that it had exercised its option to acquire 100% of the tenement. The Tenement was granted on 2 October 2023 and expires on 26 October 2028 but is renewable.\nT\nhe first term is therefore five years with a possible initial extension of five years and further extensions of two years thereafter, with 40% of the licence area to be surrendered at the end of year six.\nThe Blue Rock Valley Copper and Silver Project (E08/3604) is in the Ashburton Basin, in the northwest region of Western Australia. The site is located 165km southeast of Onslow, the main port for the region's Iron and LNG exports, which is a multi-user port. Access is from the Northwest Coastal Highway on a well-maintained unsealed road. Refer to Figure 6 below for location.\nProject Geology\nThe eastern portion of the Project area overlies the Wyloo Group sedimen",

Assays from historical drilling and significant historical rock chip samples suggest the presence of high-grade copper and silver mineralisation as well as the potential for uranium. Since the acquisition we already have completed ground based gravity surveys and APEX Geoscience have been appointed to further advance exploration on the project, with potential drill targets identified during the course of 2025.\nElsewhere in Australia, our Northern Zone Gold Project (\"Northern Zone\") has continued to advance under the management of local partner, ASX listed Riversgold Limited (\"Riversgold\"), with further excellent drill results announced during the course of 2024 and, in December, we submitted our mining lease application to the Department of Energy, Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety in Western Australia. The mining lease application can take more than 12 months and during this time we will continue with on-going drilling to further develop this project before proceeding to a maiden Mineral Resource Estimate (\"MRE\").\nSubsequent to the year end, Riversgold advised that it had completed the minimum required expenditure on the Northern Zone to exercise their 80% option. The joint venture (\"JV\") is currently undergoing formalisation, with completion of JV documentation anticipated to be by 31 December 2025. Upon finalisation, Oracle will retain a 20% beneficial interest in the project.\nIn Pakistan, the Company continues to make progress on its domestic projects, albeit slowly, although a number of significant milestones have been achieved during the year for the Green Hydrogen Project. These milestones are outlined in detail in the Chief Executive's Report, although the highlight was clearly the completion of the technical and commercial feasibility study undertaken by Thyssenkupp Uhde, which provided a very positive outlook for the project.\nElsewhere in Pakistan, we continue to maintain a useful and active dialogue with the Power Division, Ministry of Energy, in connection with the proposed development of the Company's planned 1,320MW coal to power project under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (\"CPEC\"). We also signed a significant Memorandum of Understanding for the off-take and planned development of this project, which is also outlined in detail in the Chief Executive's Report.\nOn the corporate front, we were pleased to welcome Ms Emma Priestley as a new Non-Executive Director to the Company in July 2024. Ms Priestley is an experienced mining executive, who is also a graduate of the Camborne School of Mines and a Chartered Mining Engineer and Charter Mineral Surveyor.\nOther changes to the Board of Directors during the year included the resignation of Mr Mark Steed, and we once again thank Mr Steed for his past service and contribution to the Company's development.\nDuring the year the Company raised a total of \u00a3866,667 via two share placements and the exercise of outstanding warrants and the Board would like to thank shareholders for their continued support with regard to these fund raisings. These funds are being used to progress the Company's various projects and for general working capital purposes.\nA more comprehensive overview of the Company's operational highlights for 2024 is set out in the Chief Executive's Report.\nWe continue to be most grateful to the Pakistani authorities for their continued support and to the West Australian mining authorities for help",

This work is aimed at progressing the Project towards a maiden Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE).\nHighlights\n:\no\nMetallurgical testing, using the cyanide bottle roll method, indicated gold recoveries from two oxide samples of:\n-\n93.67% and 90.64% (duplicate sample), a 92.16% average.\n-\nSimilar testing of three oxide samples in 2022 reported an average gold recovery of 92.9% over 24 hours.\n-\nThis indicates an overall average gold recovery from the five samples of 92.56%\no\nAll assay results are now returned, providing a clear direction for future drilling to connect the west and east mineralised zones. Final results set out in Tables 1-3 below.\no\nThe PoW for this drilling has been recently approved.\no\nAn upcoming site visit is planned to review and discuss the mineralisation models on Northern Zone prepared by the consultants, Xirlatem, as the Project moves towards a maiden MRE.\nNaheed Memon, CEO of Oracle, commented\n:\n\"Metallurgical testwork using cyanide bottle roll has closely replicated the original 2022 work previously reported, with all results between 90.64% and 94.7% for five samples, resulting in an average 92.56% gold recovery. This is an excellent result and bodes well for future plans to scope out potential starter pits for toll treatment. All the results are back from the recent reverse circulation and aircore drilling programmes, which illustrates the main oxide mineralisation has the potential to link the west and east mineralised zones.\nThe structural and geological modelling being undertaken by Xirlatem, will continue the solid basis for the maiden MRE and will inform future drilling. We will continue to update shareholders as we progress the project.\"\nNorthern Zone Metallurgy Results\n:\nAs announced on 13 June 2022, three metallurgical samples were submitted to Nagrom's metallurgical laboratory in Perth, in order to determine potential gold recoveries of Northern Zone oxide material from the previous Reverse Circulation (\"RC\") drilling conducted by the Company in October 2021. This was undertaken by Riversgold Limited (ASX: RGL) (\"Riversgold\") as part of its initial due diligence. The results from the three samples showed recoveries of\n91.8% and 92%,\nwith a maximum individual recovery of\n94.7%\nfor an average recovery of\n92.9%\nafter 24 hours.\nThe most recent cyanide bottle roll results on RC drill hole NZRC008 (Figure 2) was undertaken by Jinnings in Perth and has shown recoveries on a single composite and duplicate sample of\n93.67% and 90.64% respectively\nand averages\n92.16%\n.\nThe overall average gold recoveries from both the 2022 and 2025 cyanide Bottle Roll tests is\n92.56%\nwhich bolsters confidence in excellent metallurgy for the Northern Zone project.\nNorthern Zone Latest Drilling Results\nThe final assay results have been received for 414 samples from the final 11 vertical aircore (\nAC\n) drill holes (\nTables 1-3)\nof the 32 hole 1,805m programme. The drill holes on the north-western side of the tenement appeared to have closed off mineralisation, however, drill holes NZAC144 and NZAC145 have intersected shallow zones of mineralisation that will require follow-up drilling.\nThe AC and RC programme results (see also\nFigures 3-4\n), continue to successfully intersect the mineralised host porphyry over an increasing footprint and consistently validate the broader gold mineralisation model. Further drilling will be undertaken to further the understanding of the project as it advances to a maiden MRE. The current structural analysis by Xirlatem will also assist with future targeting. The priority moving forwards is the connection of the western and eastern zones of mineralisation, over an area which has had limited drill testing. The 2025 drilling results to date have confirmed this strategy, to rapidly increase the oxide potential.\nFor further information on Oracle, please visit the Company's website at\nhttp://www.oraclepower.co.uk\nor contact\n:\nOracle Power PLC\nNaheed Memon - CEO +44 (0) 20 3580 4314\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser & Broker)\nRory Murphy, Matthew Chandler, Rob Patrick +44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nSt Brides Partners Limited (Financial PR)\nSusie Geliher, Isabel de Salis +44 (0) 20 7236 1177\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of EU Regulation No. 596/2014, which forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of",

Oracle Power announced on the 11 June 2024 that it had exercised its option to acquire 100% of the tenement. The Tenement was granted on 2 October 2023 and expires on 26 October 2028 but is renewable.\nT\nhe first term is therefore five years with a possible initial extension of five years and further extensions of two years thereafter, with 40% of the licence area to be surrendered at the end of year six.\nThe Blue Rock Valley Copper and Silver Project (E08/3604) is in the Ashburton Basin, in the northwest region of Western Australia. The site is located 165km southeast of Onslow, the main port for the region's Iron and LNG exports, which is a multi-user port. Access is from the Northwest Coastal Highway on a well-maintained unsealed road.\nProject Geology\nThe eastern portion of the Project area overlies the Wyloo Group sediments of the Ashburton Basin which are unconformably overlain by rocks of the Edmund Basin (previously the Bangemall Basin), which cover the western portion of the Tenement. The contact between the Ashburton and Edmund basins is interpreted as being a thrust contact with movement to the west and can be clearly seen in the regional aeromagnetic image.\nMineralisation\nThe Ashburton Mineral Field (which incorporates the Project area) has a long history of gold, copper, silver, lead and zinc exploration.\nSeveral smaller prospects which were historically exploited for gold, copper, silver and lead are located nearby including the Soldiers Secret and Top Camp gold deposits. Small-scale production of copper, lead and silver has also been recorded in the Ashburton Basin, mainly from the Ashburton Downs copper deposits within the P",

The time to complete the formal Joint Venture arrangements going forward was mutually agreed to be extended to 31 December 2025 to facilitate the conversion of the tenement to a mining lease.\nNaheed Memon, CEO of Oracle, commented\n:\n\"Riversgold has spent the minimum commitment required to exercise the exclusive option to acquire an 80% beneficial interest in the Northern Zone and will now carry Oracle up to formalising joint venture agreements by 31 December 2025.\n\"We now look forward to Riversgold continuing to add value to the Project with further drilling to upgrade the tenement status to a mining lease. With the gold price per ounce currently at +A$4,500, this Project is looking like a potential candidate for contract mining, trucking and toll milling operations. The aim is to build a robust Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) in the upper section of the porphyry to generate an economic starter pit and I look forward to providing further updates from Kalgoorlie in the coming weeks.\"\n**ENDS**\nFor further information on Oracle, visit the Company's website\nhttp://www.oraclepower.co.uk\nor contact:\nOracle Power PLC\nNaheed Memon - CEO +44 (0) 203 580 4314\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser & Broker)\nRory Murphy, Matthew Chandler, Rob Patrick +44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nSt Brides Partners Limited (Financial PR)\nSusie Geliher, Isabel De Salis +44 (0) 20 7236 1177\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 as it forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended by virtue of the Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Specifically, the Company has\nagreed with Peel Hunt LLP (\"Peel Hunt\"), the holder of warrants over 1,666,666,667 ordinary shares of 0.001p each (\"Ordinary Shares\") in Oracle, previously exercisable at 0.032p, to exercise all its warrants at 0.025p each (\"Warrant Exercise\") in order to raise gross proceeds of \u00a3416,667. This exercise price represents a 16.7% discount to the Company's mid-market share price at yesterday's market close, and therefore the Warrant Exercise is considered by the Board to be a more cost-effective way of raising funds at this time than a placing. The Company has a further 613,544,706 warrants outstanding, with exercise prices of between 0.07p and 0.17p. These will be repriced on the same basis (the \"Warrant Repricing\").\nThe Company has received notice from Peel Hunt to exercise its entire holding of warrants at 0.025p each over 1,666,666,667\nnew\nOrdinary Sh\nares (\nthe\n\"\nWarrant Exercise Shares\n\").\nUse of Proceeds\nThe net proceeds of the\nWarrant Exercise\nwill be primarily used to support further development of the Company's projects in Australia, the advancement of the green hydrogen project\nin Pakistan\nthrough the joint venture with His Highness Sheikh Ahmed Dalmook Al Maktoum (through his wholly owned company, Kaheel Energy Limited), and for general working capital purposes.\nRelated\nP\narty\nT\nransaction\nPeel Hunt was\na substantial shareholder in Oracle within the last 12 months and, as such, is considered to be\na related party under\nRule 13 of\nthe AIM Rules for Companies (\"AIM Rules\")\n. Accordingly, the repricing of Peel Hunt's warrants is an AIM Rule 13 related party transaction (\"Transaction\").\nThe Directors of the Company, having consulted with the Company's nominated adviser, Strand Hanson Limited, consider the terms of the Transaction to be fair and reasonable insofar as the Company's shareholders are concerned.\nAdmission to Trading and Total Voting Rights\nApplication will be made to the London Stock Exchange plc for the Warrant Exercise Shares to be admitted to trading on AIM (\n\"\nAdmission\n\"\n). It is expected that Admission will become effective at 8:00 a.m. on or around\n1\n8 December 2024. The\nWarrant Exercise\nShares will rank\npari passu\nwith the existing Ordinary Shares.\nFollowing Admission, the total ordinary issued share capital of the Company will be 10,272,823,185 Ordinary Shares, with no shares held in Treasury. Therefore, the total voting rights in the Company following Admission will be 10,272,823,185 and this figure may be used by shareholders in the Company as the denominator for the calculations by which they will determine if they are required to notify their interest in, or a change in their interest in, the share capital of the Company under the FCA's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules.\nRevised warrant certificates as adjusted for the Warrant Repricing will be sent to the remaining warrant holders in due course.\nNaheed Memon, CEO of Oracle, commented\n:\n\"\nAs we\ncontinue to advance our projects in Australia and Pakistan, the proceeds from today's warrant exercise will enable us to raise additional capital at a lower discount than would have been possible through the usual equity placing.

The Mining Lease application can take more than 12 months and in this time the Company intends to focus on more drilling to develop the Project before proceeding with a maiden Mineral Resource Estimate.\nHighlights:\n\u00b7\nMining Lease (M25/389) application has been submitted to the Department of Energy, Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety (DEMIRS)\n\u00b7\nThe Mining Lease application is based on all drilling to date at the Northern Zone Gold Project, located 25km east of Kalgoorlie\n\u00b7\nThe Leapfrog gold mineralisation model will be used to inform and guide future drilling campaigns as the Project matures and grows.\n\u00b7\nThe continuation of the high-grade oxide zone within the 600m wide porphyry system has been further expanded and is open in multiple directions.\nNaheed Memon, CEO of Oracle, commented:\n\"The lodgment of the Mining Lease application for the Northern Zone Gold Project is a great next step forward for this fast-growing project. We have drilled some very significant gold intercepts under the Kalgoorlie landscape and we have a strong belief in this project to deliver significant future value for Riversgold and Oracle Power. Conversion of the tenement status to the higher order Mining Lease will increase security of tenure of the Project to an initial 21 years and is an important next step should we wish to develop the Northern Zone Gold Project as a gold mine. We will continue to drill out this exciting project in the new year.\"\n**ENDS**\nOracle Power PLC\nNaheed Memon - CEO\n+44 (0) 20 7236 1177\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser & Broker)\nRory Murphy, Matthew Chandler, Rob Patrick\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nSt Brides Partners Limited (Financial PR)\nIsabel de Salis, Susie Geliher\noracle@stbridespartners.co.uk\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of EU Regulation No. 596/2014, which forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the European (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

The drilling which has been targeting higher grade shallow gold mineralisation, may lead to these areas being the future focus of reverse circulation and diamond drilling below the higher-grade oxide gold mineralisation to expedite the Project towards a maiden Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE). We are encouraged by the recent success of Black Cat's Myhree open pit operations\n[1]\nonly 7km up the road from the Northern Zone Project and we are assessing if similar operations can be achieved with the Northern Zone Project after we convert the tenement to a Mining Lease. The compliance mineralisation report required for the application is nearing completion and we expect will be lodged early next week.\"\nFurther Information\nThe Leapfrog model (Figures 1 and 2) indicates that the mineralisation envelope and footprint continue to grow, with the 3-dimensional (3D) Leapfrog model being used to refine areas for the next round of drilling. The drilling, which has been targeting higher grade shallow gold mineralisation, may lead to these areas being the future focus of reverse circulation and diamond drilling below the higher-grade oxide gold mineralisation. Gold mineralisation remains open in multiple directions and will require further modelling and drill testing as the Northern Zone Project matures. The Company will continue to further its understanding, in conjunction with its potential JV partner, Riversgold Limited, of the Project before proceeding with a maiden Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE).\n-ENDS-\nFor further information contact:\nOracle Power PLC\nNaheed Memon - CEO\n+44 (0) 20 7236 1177\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser & Broker)\nRory Murphy, Matthew Chandler, Rob Patrick\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nSt Brides Partners Limited (Financial PR)\nIsabel de Salis, Susie Geliher\noracle@stbridespartners.co.uk\nFigure 1: Cross\n-\nsection of 3D Leapfrog software model.

We are particularly encouraged by the recent success of Black Cat's Myhree open pit operations\n[1]\nonly 7km north of the Northern Zone Project and we are assessing if similar operations would be achieved at the Northern Zone Project after we convert the tenement to a Mining Lease - which is work in progress post the imminent completion of the mineralisation report.\"\nFollowing on from the successful aircore programmes completed in May, July and September 2024, Riversgold (the Company's potential JV partner) engaged drilling contractor, Australian Aircore Drilling (Mick Shorter), to undertake a fourth aircore programme for a further 26 holes in early November 2024. A further 1,545m of AC drilling (refer Appendix 1 for all drill data information and significant intercepts, Tables 1, 2 and 3) was completed at the Northern Zone Project in the most recent drilling campaign, bringing the total number of metres drilled this year to 8,971m of AC drilling and 1,363m of reverse circulation drilling.\nThe AC holes were drilled using a blade to drilling refusal. The cuttings were logged by RGL geologists, and both the detailed logging and assays continue to show that a significant gold mineralisation event has taken place within the project area.\nToday's results covering 16 holes, of which 14 intersected gold mineralisation, with 1,545 metres drilled, continue to successfully target the mineralised porphyry over an increasing footprint within the tenement. The expansion of the high-grade zone in the northwestern extensional area and the extension of anomalous gold mineralisation in eastern and north-eastern areas continues to validate the broader geological model. Gold mineralisation remains open in multiple directions and will require further modelling and drill testing. We will continue to further our understanding of the Northern Zone Project before proceeding with a maiden Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE).\nPossible ore processing scenarios have been demonstrated by the recent success of Black Cat Syndicate Ltd via their use of a turn-key funding, development and processing package at their Myhree/Boundary open pits\n[2]\n, which are located 7km to the north of the Northern Zone Project.\nFor further information contact:\nOracle Power PLC\nNaheed Memon - CEO\n+44 (0) 20 7236 1177\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser & Broker)\nRory Murphy, Matthew Chandler, Rob Patrick\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nSt Brides Partners Limited (Financial PR)\nIsabel de Salis, Susie Geliher\noracle@stbridespartners.co.uk\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of EU Regulation No. 596/2014, which forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the European (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended.\nCompetent Person's Statement\nThe Information in this announcement that relates to exploration results, exploration targets, mineral resources or ore reserves is based on information compiled by Mr Edward Mead, who is a",

Oracle Energy, in collaboration with its joint development partner, China Electric Power Equipment and Technology Co., Ltd. (\"CET\"), a subsidiary of State Grid Corporation of China (\"State Grid China\"), engaged Power Planners International (Pvt.) Ltd (\"PPI\"), to undertake the Study. PPI is a distinguished company renowned for its expertise in power system analysis and planning, particularly in the domain of grid interconnection studies for renewable energy projects.\nThe Study, entirely funded by State Grid China, assessed the technical feasibility of interconnecting the proposed 1.3GW Hybrid Renewable Energy Power Plant (the \"Hybrid RE PP\"), which consists of 800MW solar power, 500MW wind power generation and a suitable battery energy storage system, to provide renewable power to the National Grid. Based on the updated transmission plan and load forecast provided by the National Transmission and Dispatch Company (\"NTDC\"), the Study proposes interconnecting the plant to the 220kV Jhimpir-II Grid Station via a direct 220kV double circuit transmission line of 35km in length, using a quad bundle rail conductor. The Study outlines the generation voltage for the Hybrid RE PP, which will be increased to 33kV using transformers at each inverter and collector group. The net maximum output of the plant is expected to be 1,155MW. Additionally, a 260MW battery energy storage system (BESS) is proposed to enhance system reliability, and a static var compensator (SVC) will be installed to maintain the required power factor, thereby fulfilling NTDC Grid Code requirements.\nComprehensive load flow studies were performed for peak and off-peak conditions during both summer and winter periods, demonstrating the reliability of the proposed transmission scheme under normal and contingency (N-1) conditions. Short circuit and dynamic stability analyses confirmed that fault currents are within rated capacities, and the system successfully passed dynamic stability checks, ensuring resilience under fault conditions.\nThe completed Study has now been submitted to NTDC for review and approval by the Pakistan Government. This approval process will be critical in advancing the project towards implementation and the Company looks forward to providing further updates in due course.\nOracle's CEO, Naheed Memon, commented\n:\n\"We are pleased to confirm the completion of this key Study for our proposed hybrid renewable energy power plant in Jhimpir. This milestone marks the culmination of extensive investigative studies and sets the stage for the next phase of detailed engineering design (FEED). The findings of the Study provide a solid foundation for securing potential off-take agreements for power. Our strategic focus remains on ultimately seamlessly integrating renewable energy into the National Grid, thereby enhancing energy security and promoting sustainable development in Pakistan.\"\n-ENDS-\nFor further information contact\n:\nOracle Power PLC\nNaheed Memon - CEO\n+44 (0) 20 7236 1177\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser & Broker)\nRory Murphy, Matthew Chandler, Rob Patrick\n+44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nSt Brides Partners Limited (Financial PR)\nIsabel de Salis, Susie Geliher\noracle@stbridespartners.co.uk\nAbout PPI\nPower Planners International (Pvt.)

The values from selected drill holes are given in Tables 1-3 and in\nFigure 2\n. Results from a further 16 drillholes are anticipated to be received shortly.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nThe drilling programme has continued to intersect shallow gold mineralisation as drilling expands the gold footprint at the Northern Zone Gold Project.\n\u00b7\nFirst assay results now arriving for 2026, with significant results, including:\n\u00b7\n8m @ 5.81 g/t Au from 46m (NZAC179)\n\u00b7\n7m @ 3.48 g/t Au from 48m (NZAC181)\n\u00b7\n5m @ 3.13 g/t Au from 41m (NZAC170)\n\u00b7\n4m @ 2.28 g/t Au from 43m (NZAC182)\n\u00b7\nFurther significant results shown in tables below\n\u00b7\nDrilling results from a further 16 drillholes due to be received in two batches over the coming weeks.\n\u00b7\nDrill rig booked for 10 February aiming to continue expanding the oxide gold mineralisation footprint.\n\u00b7\nConversion to Mining Lease process continues with the Heritage Agreement a major step forward.\n[1]\n\u00b7\nThe Mine Development and Closure Plan (MDCP) and the associated environmental assessments have commenced with Resource WA.\nNaheed Memon, CEO of Oracle, commented\n:\n\"It is great to follow on from previous announcements and continue to expand and intersect gold grades in the northeast area and expand the saddle area. We believe these results are very impressive and add significant upside to the project for our plans with our partners for gold production targeted for later this year. Our modelling suggests that this could constitute part of a ~600m wide zone of shallow oxide mineralisation overlying the Northern Zone porphyry system.\n\"Oracle also notes from Riversgold's news release on the ASX today that MEGA Resources has become a shareholder of Riversgold, and we see this as highly promising for the JV partnership going forward.\n\"We are still awaiting results from 16 drillholes, expected in the coming weeks, and we are looking forward to the assays that will be from the northeast and saddle areas.\n\"The two recently completed drill programmes were designed to add to our gold footprint in the top 50-60m at our Kalgoorlie Gold Project, and to enhance the MEGA Resources mining scenario for 2026\n[2]\n. Results continue to expand the lateral footprint of Northern Zone and we are achieving the goal of making the project bigger in the oxide zone. I look forward to updating shareholders as we progress the project.\"\nThe latest drill programme results (\nTables 1-3\n) continue to successfully intersect the mineralised host porphyry over an increasing footprint and consistently validate the broader gold mineralisation model. Gold mineralisation has been successfully intersected in the northeast area, with a section of drill holes to the north of an existing single line, expanding the gold mineralisation footprint (\nFigure 2\n). More drill results from the saddle area between the west and east zones is filling in nicely, with a further 12 holes due shortly. A key SW-NE cross-section derived from 3D Leapfrog software is illustrated in\nFigure 3.\nThe interpretation illustrates gold grade shells derived from all the significant intercepts reported by Riversgold to April 2025. The Leapfrog model will be updated once all pending assays are received.\nNorthern Zone is hosted within a porphyry unit (Tonalite- Trondhjemite Intrusion, TTI), with high background gold and horizontal gold mineralised units within the TTI unit. The Northern Zone Project sits within the Canon Shear or fault zone, with further drilling required to define the limits of mineralisation identified to date. The horizontal mineralisation makes drilling to date perpendicular to the gold mineralisation, and no water in drilling to a depth of 60 metres makes the TTI also suitable for drilling with the techniques the Company has utilised to date.\nRiversgold will continue advancing its understanding of the Kalgoorlie Project before proceeding with a maiden Mineral Resource Estimate (\nMRE\n), but this drilling will be used by Mega Resources in their mine planning for our joint plans to start mining in the first half of 2026.\nFor further information on Oracle, visit the Company\n'\ns website at\nhttp://www.oraclepower.co.uk\nor contact\n:\nOracle Power PLC\nNaheed Memon - CEO +44 (0) 203 580 4314\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser & Broker)\nRory Murphy, Matthew Chandler, Rob Patrick +44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nSt Brides Partners Limited (Financial PR)\nSusie Geliher, Will Turner +44 (0) 20 7236 1177\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of EU Regulation No. 596/2014, which forms part of",

Most of us are buying in as an investment, because we see ORCP on a free carry to a rapidly expanding gold resource. Who knows it could be a Super pit 2. So while SM might be correct about a particular day's SP movement, it doesn't make them more right about OCPR as an investment than anyone else. In fact, they are quite wrong about it, when you look at the medium to long term investment future of this company. When you support their day to day trolling, you're only encouraging the short term day-trade trolling that pis ses off everyone else on here who are investing for a longer period than one day. Sorry for the sermon but please don't troll us with a troll \ud83e\uddcc",

The team reviewed progress on the critical 105-kilometer railway line connecting Thar coal mines to Bin Qasim, a key infrastructure project aimed at bolstering Pakistan\u2019s energy security through efficient coal transport. The project also includes a 9 km track extension from Bin Qasim to Port Qasim and a dedicated coal unloading facility at the port. Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah emphasised that the railway line will integrate Thar coal mines with the national railway network and Port Qasim, enabling seamless coal transportation. Valued at approximately Rs 90 billion, with the Sindh government funding 50 per cent in partnership with the Federal Government, the Sindh government has already released Rs. 6.61 billion as its share. Expressing satisfaction with the project\u2019s overall progress, Secretary Energy directed all teams to accelerate construction activities. He commended the strong collaboration from Pakistan Railways and the Frontier Works Organization (FWO) in driving implementation forward. Project officials delivered a detailed briefing on construction status. Underscoring the need for timely completion, the Secretary stressed enhanced coordination among stakeholders, including mining and power companies, to meet deadlines. Secretary Energy was accompanied by Commissioner Mirpurkhas Faisal Uqali, Deputy Commissioner Umerkot Naveed Larik, Abul Fazal Rizvi, Zahir Rahimtoola, and FWO representatives.",

Much better to send in a few boot boys to disrupt the serenity, if that don't  work post total nonsense and stonewall the readers out of existence. I think it has got totally out of hand in the last 6 months , turning off genuine contributors who become exhausted with trying to explain basic fundamentals to be just ignored and/ or saturated with more fud from the ignorant. The admin should take a good look at these accounts,  these boards should really be for investors, I see no reason for someone who is not invested to be having any opinion here. It's all smoke and mirrors , noise , clog the board tactics , that should have no place on the stock market, but you got to remember where money is involved the lowest of the low can stoop a lot lower.",

What they monetise is the volume of traffic on the site, which they then sell in the form of advertisements and impressions. So, while the bulletin boards are free to use, there is almost no point in using them.  '",

You\u2019re correct in one sense\u2026 I hold ZERO stocks on the AIM market. What I hold elsewhere is nobody\u2019s business, but I\u2019m comfortable with what I own, and I live a low-stress life because of it. Some of the tampers/derampers on these boards no doubt have issues with their blood pressure. Take a chill pill folks and relax in the knowledge that it is YOU that presses your own buy/sell buttons based on YOUR own research. It\u2019s nobody else\u2019s fault if your stocks lose value\u2026 equally only YOU should take credit if your investments rise. Nobody else presses the buttons for you. You don\u2019t need to tell me what I am, or am not, I\u2019m comfortable in my skin. Others may not be, but there\u2019s no need for anyone to be nasty to people who may hold a different view to their own. As Warrie said earlier, the AIM market and these boards are deteriorating at a rapid rate, full of desperate gamblers. Shake my head. Good luck to all, irrespective of your positions\ud83d\ude4f",

I think you are making exactly the same point I was making! \u201cHow can u use the term same period , that news was Monday morning for us as in oracle and them being riversgold and the only comparison from said rns would be in the same week would be a fair assumption. So currently off of said news which both companies stand to benefit as businesses partners the real big question is exactly how is it 1 partner has seen a 110% rise and the other a 25% drop despite all the ramping and accusations that makes absolutely no sense at all ?\u201c @warrie I don\u2019t think I twisted your words at all. I literally started the post with, \u201cI agree with you\u201d. I am lost for words that my posts could be considered toxic or not just my own thoughts. This place has become a total waste of time.

The project, which includes a 1.32 GW coal-fired power plant, a 7.9 mtpa open-pit mine, and potential coal-to-gas/liquid facilities, has attracted several key interested parties for investment, development, and off-take: Potential Chinese Buyers/Investors: Recent reports (January 2026) indicate that Oracle Power is in discussions with at least two potential buyers for the Thar Block VI project, with strong speculation focused on Chinese state-owned enterprises. PowerChina International Group Ltd: A key consortium partner that has declared its interest in the development and execution of the coal-to-power project. K-Electric (KE): Pakistan's private power utility in Karachi has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to potentially act as the sole off-taker for the 1.32 GW power plant, with options to be an equity partner. Government of Sindh: The provincial government is a key stakeholder and has the option to be an equity partner, providing support for local coal sourcing and guarantees for financing. China National Coal Development Company (CNCDC): A consortium partner involved in the feasibility work for the coal-to-gas and coal-to-liquid components of the project. Private Office of Sheikh Ahmed Dalmook Al Maktoum: Through Kaheel Energy, they have been historically involved in the project\u2019s development pathway. Contextual Factors: The project is part of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), with the coal-to-gas/liquid initiatives aligned with Pakistan's goal to address energy and fertilizer shortages. Oracle has also engaged in a separate, independent partnership with PowerChina for a 1 GW solar project on the same block. The project is being developed in two phases, with the first focusing on the 1.32 GW plant and mining, and the second on coal-to-gas/liquid expansion.",

StockMaiden Posted in: ORCP Posts: 4,104 RE: Northern Zone29 Sep 2025 19:01 ManxKippers, I'm glad you have taken advantage of the opportunity. I know it can be difficult when not too long ago this share was on a down trend and received a lot of negative criticisms. No need to thank me but appreciate the thoughts. Let's hope tonight it will be a deal as good as the GGP one which set of their run from 2p to 40p a few years back. GL StockMaiden Posted in: ORCP Posts: 4,104 RE: Northern Zone29 Sep 2025 18:40 Alans55, I hope you are still in this share. StockMaiden Posted in: ORCP Posts: 4,104 RE: Northern Zone29 Sep 2025 18:34 I think it's leaning towards a positive RNS. The volume begun before even a sniff of the news. This suggests someone knows and got in early. The large buys also suggests someone is in the know. You don't throw large chunks for a punt. StockMaiden Posted in: MATD Posts: 4,104 RE: Laughable29 Sep 2025 18:26 It's not too late to get into Orcp.

Look at mcap29 Sep 2025 18:23 Yup, and that's just the valuation for Northern Zone. We also have Thar Block, and also the Green Hydrogen project. It can be difficult to evaluate, but one thing for sure its hugely under valued. StockMaiden Posted in: ORCP Posts: 4,104 RE: Northern Zone29 Sep 2025 18:04 This is what I wrote on 25 August 2025: Oracle Power: Huge Upside Potential \u2b50 Northern Zone JV with Riversgold (on free carry until JV agreements formalize, expected by December 2025) Targeting 4.8 million Oz gold. A 20% share equates to $3.2billion \u2b50 In talk with two interested parties for the potential sale of the Thar Block. Oracle Power valued its Thar Block VI project at over $1 billion. Even if it's sold at 10% of the valuation, then we would be looking at $100 million. \u2b50 Recent MOU renewal with China Electric Other news to look forward to: Blue Rock Valley Project(Copper), Green Hydrogen Project with His Highness Sheikh, a 540M holder Low market cap (huge upside). Any one of the projects on a success case will be many multiples of today's market cap.

It means that they are sitting on a paper loss and are at the mercy of the placing news. The share price rises couldn't sustain (and I have mentioned this loads of times) is because the wider market is anticipating a fund raise, and we know one is coming because of the company's financial position. It may be tomorrow, or next week, but one thing for certain is that Oracle has only approx \u00a3200K in the bank. Veteran traders knows this and the would never hold a share with 15 billion shares in issue and on the verge of a raise. Hence, any rises people will sell out for their quick profit. It's why the share price drift back down from 16% high today. That's my take on it anyway.",

That loses all credibility for me. For example, SM has just spoken about not sustaining the share price with so many in circulation.  Why did he never mention this when he was invested?  Instead he said the share would get to 5p which I always though was a tad optimistic to say the least.  To.summarise, when invested in the share were going to 5p.  Now he's sold the share we were going to the 0.0020's as he stated yesterday.  It's one extreme to another and I've seen her do this in several other shares.

I'm afraid you have fallen to the lies of a convincing liar here.  I still don't understand what you think is credible going from ramping a share and stating it will go to 5p to.ghen saying the share will re-trace to under 0.003. You must also ask yourself why someone wants to continuously spam a board having sold their shares? The answer is simple,   They want a cheaper buy in price and then you will see SM turn back to chief ramper again. I think I'm right in thinking Manchester Utd play Arsenal at the weekend.  In the first half SM will be a Manchester Utd supporter.  However, at half time they will become a Arsenal supporter.  That's how this person works.  I used to see through people like this for a living.  Credible is not a word I would use in my descriptions. Remember, some people used to think Jimmy Savile was credible. Yet he hid his real intentions in plain sight.  SM does the same, albeit when it comes to  investing shares rather than sex offending!!!!",

Gold is flirting with that magical US$5000 an ounce mark (around A$7300), on track to effectively double in price in little over a year. Our Runners this week carry a distinctly geopolitical flavour, dominated by gold plays and critical minerals names. The ASX is once again paying rapt attention, with juniors and producers alike catching the tailwind from this macro madness. No green dreams here - just hard assets in a world that\u2019s rediscovering their value the old-fashioned way\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 RIVERSGOLD LTD (ASX: RGL) Up 109% (1.1c \u2013 2.3c) Rounding out our Runners this week is near-term gold producer Riversgold Limited, which unveiled shallow high-grade gold hits from its Kalgoorlie project, accompanied by a recent strategic $2.15 million capital raising at 1 cent per share. The company struck high-grade gold in 21 holes at its Northern Zone gold development in Western Australia. Drilling intersected the mineralised host porphyry across the north-east, west and east zones, expanding the footprint and lending further weight to the company\u2019s broader gold model. Best intercepts included 8m at 5.81g/t gold from 46m, 7m at 3.48g/t from 48m and 5m at 3.13g/t from 41m. Riversgold says modelling points to a 600m-wide zone of shallow oxide mineralisation sitting above the Northern Zone porphyry system. The good news kept coming. Kalgoorlie development partner MEGA Resources will tip in $1 million via a placement for 100 million shares. Under an agreement signed in September, MEGA will fund the project and provide geological, engineering, project management, mining and haulage services, with profits split 50:50. MEGA will also recycle 10 per cent of its monthly proceeds into expansion-grade control and step-out drilling. Riversgold says it will continue refining its understanding of the Kalgoorlie project ahead of a maiden resource estimate, with MEGA already factoring the latest data into mine planning for a first-half 2026 start.",

At the lower end of the market, these boards are used to encourage the na\u00efve to buy into a stock. There are many who have multi-IDs who then literally have a conversation with themselves, in an attempt to generate excitement around the stock. Should anyone post a contrasting opinion \u2013 they are called out as a \u2018shorter\u2019 or a \u2018deramper\u2019 and are the subject of abuse. Worse still, the group encourages everyone to \u2018report\u2019 the post in an attempt to have the post automatically deleted. This means that anyone viewing the board will only see one positive narrative because the posts that are automatically deleted are not reviewed by anyone. Those who own the bulletin boards don\u2019t care about the actual content of the posts, because they\u2019re not monetising the boards. What they monetise is the volume of traffic on the site, which they then sell in the form of advertisements and impressions. So, while the bulletin boards are free to use, there is almost no point in using them.",

More results due and revenues could come by the end of 2026 from the gold production, that derisks the costs of the company, cash in the coffers gives them a better bargaining tool for the mou for Thar. Oracle Power PLC (AIM: ORCP), a developer of green hydrogen production through its joint venture Oracle Energy Limited (\"Oracle Energy\"), announces a strategic Memorandum of Understanding (\"MoU\") with China Electric Power and Technology Co., Ltd (\"CET\") to potentially develop, finance, construct, operate and maintain Oracle Energy's Green Hydrogen Project in Thatta, Sindh Province, Pakistan (the \"Green Hydrogen Project\"). CET is a wholly-owned subsidiary of State Grid Corporation of China, the largest power producer in the world by revenue in 2021. The MoU with CET, which has a mandate to finance, build, operate and maintain large renewable power generation projects within and outside of China, is focused on accelerating the development of Oracle Energy's Green Hydrogen Project, which includes the construction of a Hybrid Renewable Energy Production and Storage facility, combining 700MW of solar and 500MW of wind power, and battery storage.

          "content": "Small AIM resource stocks like Oracle Power tend to have high risk and volatility, often driven by newsflow and project milestones rather than steady earnings. They are very different from established companies or index stocks. The company has no current commercial revenue and posted a loss in the first half of 2025, continuing a trend of operating losses. Without cash flow, the business depends on equity financing to fund project work. Oracle Power has increased its share count through warrant exercises. This expanded the total issued share capital dramatically. When a company issues new shares into the market, the value of each existing share can be diluted, and that often puts downward pressure on share price. Market summaries list Oracle Power among one of the larger decliners on AIM on recent trading days. Investors should be cautious and do detailed research before investing",

You\u2019re applying 'Blue Chip' logic to a 'Growth Discovery' engine. Let\u2019s address the reality of Oracle Power (ORCP): \"No Revenue\" is the point you claim; they have no commercial revenue. No kidding. Oracle isn't a grocery store; it\u2019s a project incubator. In the junior resource sector, you don't buy for 'earnings'\u2014you buy for asset appreciation. * The Reality: By the time a junior stock has \"steady earnings,\" the share price is already 10x higher. We are here for the re-rating that happens when a prospect becomes a proven mine. 2. Dilution is \"Fuel,\" Not a Leak You mentioned the increase in share count. In mining, cash is the fuel for the drill bit. \u2022 The Winning Argument: Would you rather own 100% of a company with \u00a30 in the bank and no drills in the ground, or a slightly diluted piece of a company that is actually hitting shallow, high-grade gold intercepts in Kalgoorlie? \u2022 The Context: Oracle just expanded its Northern Zone footprint (Jan 2026) and is moving toward production. That \"dilution\" paid for the drills that just increased the value of the ground we own. 3. You\u2019re Looking at the Rear-View Mirror You cited recent \"declines\" on AIM. Smart money looks at forward catalysts, not yesterday\u2019s chart noise. \u2022 The Pipeline: While you\u2019re worried about last week's price, the company has secured a Mining Licence application for Kalgoorlie and an extension on the Green Hydrogen LOI in Pakistan through May 2026. \u2022 The Partnership: We are partnered with Riversgold (ASX:RGL) and State Grid Corporation of China. Global titans don\u2019t sign MoUs with \"failing\" companies; they sign them with companies that hold strategic land. 4. The \"Risk\" is Mispriced You suggest \"caution\" and \"detailed research.\" I agree. Detailed research shows gold is at record highs, and Oracle is sitting on a project in the heart of the Kalgoorlie Super Pit region\u2014the most de-risked mining jurisdiction on earth. Bottom Line: You\u2019re describing the nature of the AIM market as if it\u2019s a failure of the company. If you want \"steady earnings\" and \"low volatility,\" go buy a utility company and enjoy your 3% returns. We\u2019re here for the discovery.\" Go back to ramping ALRT you absolute \ud83e\udd21 which is due a placing by the way. Drown her out!",

People dismissed a lot of information because it WASN'T what they wanted to hear, and now, they themselves need to hold accountable for their investment. Here's a recap of the company: The split: Strictly speaking, it's 80/20 split between Riversgold and Oracle. Then it's another 50/50 split from the 20% between Oracle and Mega. So Oracle will only receive 10% of whatever potential find. Oracle projects & running costs: Oracle stated that the initial phase of the Thar Block VI coal and power development carried a gross project cost of about US$1.6 billion. For the Green Hydrogen project, total cost is projected at about US$2 billion. There's also the Blue Rock Valley project and other company expenses to pay. Potential revenue Vs expenses: The Northern Zone has a best case scenario of \u00a3600 million POTENTIAL. Oracle's expenses is absolute, and as announced the Thar project alone will require $1.6billion. The Northern Zone 10% simply isn't going to cut it for Oracle in the long run. Their expenses greatly exceeds any potential income. The fundamentals: 15billion shares issued speaks for itself. Last checked Oracle only has about \u00a3500K and this was in June 2025. Administrative expenses for 6 months is approx \u00a3280K. We are approaching February 2026, it means that Oracle has only approx \u00a3200K left in the bank. Any potential revenue from Northern Zone won't happen immediately whereas the urgency for Oracle to raise will. It's clear as day what will happen next.",

They are very different from established companies or index stocks. The company has no current commercial revenue and posted a loss in the first half of 2025, continuing a trend of operating losses. Without cash flow, the business depends on equity financing to fund project work. Oracle Power has increased its share count through warrant exercises. This expanded the total issued share capital dramatically. When a company issues new shares into the market, the value of each existing share can be diluted, and that often puts downward pressure on share price. Market summaries list Oracle Power among one of the larger decliners on AIM on recent trading days. Investors should be cautious and do detailed research before investing",

Gold is flirting with that magical US$5000 an ounce mark (around A$7300), on track to effectively double in price in little over a year. Our Runners this week carry a distinctly geopolitical flavour, dominated by gold plays and critical minerals names. The ASX is once again paying rapt attention, with juniors and producers alike catching the tailwind from this macro madness. No green dreams here - just hard assets in a world that\u2019s rediscovering their value the old-fashioned way\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 RIVERSGOLD LTD (ASX: RGL) Up 109% (1.1c \u2013 2.3c) Rounding out our Runners this week is near-term gold producer Riversgold Limited, which unveiled shallow high-grade gold hits from its Kalgoorlie project, accompanied by a recent strategic $2.15 million capital raising at 1 cent per share. The company struck high-grade gold in 21 holes at its Northern Zone gold development in Western Australia. Drilling intersected the mineralised host porphyry across the north-east, west and east zones, expanding the footprint and lending further weight to the company\u2019s broader gold model. Best intercepts included 8m at 5.81g/t gold from 46m, 7m at 3.48g/t from 48m and 5m at 3.13g/t from 41m. Riversgold says modelling points to a 600m-wide zone of shallow oxide mineralisation sitting above the Northern Zone porphyry system. The good news kept coming. Kalgoorlie development partner MEGA Resources will tip in $1 million via a placement for 100 million shares. Under an agreement signed in September, MEGA will fund the project and provide geological, engineering, project management, mining and haulage services, with profits split 50:50. MEGA will also recycle 10 per cent of its monthly proceeds into expansion-grade control and step-out drilling. Riversgold says it will continue refining its understanding of the Kalgoorlie project ahead of a maiden resource estimate, with MEGA already factoring the latest data into mine planning for a first-half 2026 start.",

With President Trump demanding lower interest rates in the US the Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell held interest rates this time but when Kevin Warsh heads the interest rate board that will change . President Trump selected him for the job of lowering interest rates regardless of America's colossal  debt and sure enough he will forcing countries like Japan , China , etc . to carry on selling American debt to load up on bullion . To assume bullion is doing anything other than rising is very blinkered in my opinion but nothing rises in a straight line not even bullion .",

          "content": "Many people have been sucked into the hype without knowing what the company is about, and now, they are feeling agitated, and not accepting responsibility for their own investment decisions. People dismissed a lot of information because it WASN'T what they wanted to hear, and now, they themselves need to hold accountable for their investment. Here's a recap of the company: The split: Strictly speaking, it's 80/20 split between Riversgold and Oracle. Then it's another 50/50 split from the 20% between Oracle and Mega. So Oracle will only receive 10% of whatever potential find. Oracle projects & running costs: Oracle stated that the initial phase of the Thar Block VI coal and power development carried a gross project cost of about US$1.6 billion. For the Green Hydrogen project, total cost is projected at about US$2 billion. There's also the Blue Rock Valley project and other company expenses to pay. Potential revenue Vs expenses: The Northern Zone has a best case scenario of \u00a3600 million POTENTIAL. Oracle's expenses is absolute, and as announced the Thar project alone will require $1.6billion. The Northern Zone 10% simply isn't going to cut it for Oracle in the long run. Their expenses greatly exceeds any potential income. The fundamentals: 15billion shares issued speaks for itself. Last checked Oracle only has about \u00a3500K and this was in June 2025. Administrative expenses for 6 months is approx \u00a3280K. We are approaching February 2026, it means that Oracle has only approx \u00a3200K left in the bank. Any potential revenue from Northern Zone won't happen immediately whereas the urgency for Oracle to raise will. It's clear as day what will happen next.",

With the first batch of results from pre-Christmas drilling including : o  9m @ 1.33 g/t Au from 56m, (NZAC146) o  3m @ 4.39 g/t Au from 45m, (NZAC149) o  3m @ 1.89 g/t Au from 48m, (NZAC150) o  5m @ 1.75 g/t Au from 61m (EOH), (NZAC150) o  4m @ 0.83 g/t Au from 47m, (NZAC151) followed by the second batch of results in the previously undrilled \"saddle\"  including : o  5m at 3.09 g/t Au from 47m (NZAC152) o  6m at 0.72 g/t Au from 66m (end-of-hole) (NZAC152) o  6m at 0.65 g/t Au from 32m (NZAC153) o  1m at 11.0 g/t Au from 46m (NZAC153) o  8m at 0.62 g/t Au from 32m (NZAC154) o  2m at 1.47 g/t Au from 49m (NZAC155) o  7m at 1.58 g/t Au from 42m (NZAC156) o  2m at 1.32 g/t Au from 44m (NZAC157) Now we await drilling results from a further 16 drillholes due to be received in two batches in coming days . Hence is it a surprise the MM's went fishing for stop loses with Riversgold Ltd (RGL) last night ? With company making news being delivered in every RNS it doesn't surprise me one bit .  So looking forwards to next week might be worth reminding ourselves the MM's will always shake the unresearched , novice traders out before more good news is due . Whilst the experienced will try to buy in as cheaply as possible if the MM's are willing to sell them any .",

Even the interviewer sounded frustrated with the continuous delays and the scripted responses from Naheed. It felt like an interrogation at some point and you can literally hear Naheed's voice shaking when being questioned about progress and value realisation. The interview wasn't a showcase of confidence, it highlighted the lack of preparation, company strategies or any kind of forward plans. Listening to Naheed getting roasted doesn't really boost confidence for shareholders and potential investors. https://youtu.be/3racQO34g7s?si=ltQ0V-yQcy2XDhs_ In my honest opinion",

At the lower end of the market, these boards are used to encourage the na\u00efve to buy into a stock. There are many who have multi-IDs who then literally have a conversation with themselves, in an attempt to generate excitement around the stock. Should anyone post a contrasting opinion \u2013 they are called out as a \u2018shorter\u2019 or a \u2018deramper\u2019 and are the subject of abuse. Worse still, the group encourages everyone to \u2018report\u2019 the post in an attempt to have the post automatically deleted. This means that anyone viewing the board will only see one positive narrative because the posts that are automatically deleted are not reviewed by anyone. Those who own the bulletin boards don\u2019t care about the actual content of the posts, because they\u2019re not monetising the boards. What they monetise is the volume of traffic on the site, which they then sell in the form of advertisements and impressions. So, while the bulletin boards are free to use, there is almost no point in using them.",

Oracle Power PLC (AIM: ORCP), a developer of green hydrogen production through its joint venture Oracle Energy Limited (\"Oracle Energy\"), announces a strategic Memorandum of Understanding (\"MoU\") with China Electric Power and Technology Co., Ltd (\"CET\") to potentially develop, finance, construct, operate and maintain Oracle Energy's Green Hydrogen Project in Thatta, Sindh Province, Pakistan (the \"Green Hydrogen Project\"). CET is a wholly-owned subsidiary of State Grid Corporation of China, the largest power producer in the world by revenue in 2021. The MoU with CET, which has a mandate to finance, build, operate and maintain large renewable power generation projects within and outside of China, is focused on accelerating the development of Oracle Energy's Green Hydrogen Project, which includes the construction of a Hybrid Renewable Energy Production and Storage facility, combining 700MW of solar and 500MW of wind power, and battery storage.

They are very different from established companies or index stocks. The company has no current commercial revenue and posted a loss in the first half of 2025, continuing a trend of operating losses. Without cash flow, the business depends on equity financing to fund project work. Oracle Power has increased its share count through warrant exercises. This expanded the total issued share capital dramatically. When a company issues new shares into the market, the value of each existing share can be diluted, and that often puts downward pressure on share price. Market summaries list Oracle Power among one of the larger decliners on AIM on recent trading days. Investors should be cautious and do detailed research before investing",

You\u2019re applying 'Blue Chip' logic to a 'Growth Discovery' engine. Let\u2019s address the reality of Oracle Power (ORCP): \"No Revenue\" is the point you claim; they have no commercial revenue. No kidding. Oracle isn't a grocery store; it\u2019s a project incubator. In the junior resource sector, you don't buy for 'earnings'\u2014you buy for asset appreciation. * The Reality: By the time a junior stock has \"steady earnings,\" the share price is already 10x higher. We are here for the re-rating that happens when a prospect becomes a proven mine. 2. Dilution is \"Fuel,\" Not a Leak You mentioned the increase in share count. In mining, cash is the fuel for the drill bit. \u2022 The Winning Argument: Would you rather own 100% of a company with \u00a30 in the bank and no drills in the ground, or a slightly diluted piece of a company that is actually hitting shallow, high-grade gold intercepts in Kalgoorlie? \u2022 The Context: Oracle just expanded its Northern Zone footprint (Jan 2026) and is moving toward production. That \"dilution\" paid for the drills that just increased the value of the ground we own. 3. You\u2019re Looking at the Rear-View Mirror You cited recent \"declines\" on AIM. Smart money looks at forward catalysts, not yesterday\u2019s chart noise. \u2022 The Pipeline: While you\u2019re worried about last week's price, the company has secured a Mining Licence application for Kalgoorlie and an extension on the Green Hydrogen LOI in Pakistan through May 2026. \u2022 The Partnership: We are partnered with Riversgold (ASX:RGL) and State Grid Corporation of China. Global titans don\u2019t sign MoUs with \"failing\" companies; they sign them with companies that hold strategic land. 4. The \"Risk\" is Mispriced You suggest \"caution\" and \"detailed research.\" I agree. Detailed research shows gold is at record highs, and Oracle is sitting on a project in the heart of the Kalgoorlie Super Pit region\u2014the most de-risked mining jurisdiction on earth. Bottom Line: You\u2019re describing the nature of the AIM market as if it\u2019s a failure of the company. If you want \"steady earnings\" and \"low volatility,\" go buy a utility company and enjoy your 3% returns. We\u2019re here for the discovery.\" Go back to ramping ALRT you absolute \ud83e\udd21 which is due a placing by the way. Drown her out!",

People dismissed a lot of information because it WASN'T what they wanted to hear, and now, they themselves need to hold accountable for their investment. Here's a recap of the company: The split: Strictly speaking, it's 80/20 split between Riversgold and Oracle. Then it's another 50/50 split from the 20% between Oracle and Mega. So Oracle will only receive 10% of whatever potential find. Oracle projects & running costs: Oracle stated that the initial phase of the Thar Block VI coal and power development carried a gross project cost of about US$1.6 billion. For the Green Hydrogen project, total cost is projected at about US$2 billion. There's also the Blue Rock Valley project and other company expenses to pay. Potential revenue Vs expenses: The Northern Zone has a best case scenario of \u00a3600 million POTENTIAL. Oracle's expenses is absolute, and as announced the Thar project alone will require $1.6billion. The Northern Zone 10% simply isn't going to cut it for Oracle in the long run. Their expenses greatly exceeds any potential income. The fundamentals: 15billion shares issued speaks for itself. Last checked Oracle only has about \u00a3500K and this was in June 2025. Administrative expenses for 6 months is approx \u00a3280K. We are approaching February 2026, it means that Oracle has only approx \u00a3200K left in the bank. Any potential revenue from Northern Zone won't happen immediately whereas the urgency for Oracle to raise will. It's clear as day what will happen next.",

They are very different from established companies or index stocks. The company has no current commercial revenue and posted a loss in the first half of 2025, continuing a trend of operating losses. Without cash flow, the business depends on equity financing to fund project work. Oracle Power has increased its share count through warrant exercises. This expanded the total issued share capital dramatically. When a company issues new shares into the market, the value of each existing share can be diluted, and that often puts downward pressure on share price. Market summaries list Oracle Power among one of the larger decliners on AIM on recent trading days. Investors should be cautious and do detailed research before investing",

Gold is flirting with that magical US$5000 an ounce mark (around A$7300), on track to effectively double in price in little over a year. Our Runners this week carry a distinctly geopolitical flavour, dominated by gold plays and critical minerals names. The ASX is once again paying rapt attention, with juniors and producers alike catching the tailwind from this macro madness. No green dreams here - just hard assets in a world that\u2019s rediscovering their value the old-fashioned way\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 RIVERSGOLD LTD (ASX: RGL) Up 109% (1.1c \u2013 2.3c) Rounding out our Runners this week is near-term gold producer Riversgold Limited, which unveiled shallow high-grade gold hits from its Kalgoorlie project, accompanied by a recent strategic $2.15 million capital raising at 1 cent per share. The company struck high-grade gold in 21 holes at its Northern Zone gold development in Western Australia. Drilling intersected the mineralised host porphyry across the north-east, west and east zones, expanding the footprint and lending further weight to the company\u2019s broader gold model. Best intercepts included 8m at 5.81g/t gold from 46m, 7m at 3.48g/t from 48m and 5m at 3.13g/t from 41m. Riversgold says modelling points to a 600m-wide zone of shallow oxide mineralisation sitting above the Northern Zone porphyry system. The good news kept coming. Kalgoorlie development partner MEGA Resources will tip in $1 million via a placement for 100 million shares. Under an agreement signed in September, MEGA will fund the project and provide geological, engineering, project management, mining and haulage services, with profits split 50:50. MEGA will also recycle 10 per cent of its monthly proceeds into expansion-grade control and step-out drilling. Riversgold says it will continue refining its understanding of the Kalgoorlie project ahead of a maiden resource estimate, with MEGA already factoring the latest data into mine planning for a first-half 2026 start.",

None of this poxy taking fifty bucks profit rubbish which appears to be what's trashing most shares at the bottom end these days they just go straight up and u miss out job done",

These results represent the final assays from the 2025 drilling programme. New results for the 2026 drilling campaign are expected to follow shortly after drilling recommences on 10 February 2026.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nRiversgold continues intersecting shallow gold mineralisation as it expands it gold footprint at the Northern Zone Gold Project near Kalgoorlie in Western Australia.\n\u00b7\nThe balance of the 2025 drilling campaign has now been received, with a further 16 drillholes reported.\n\u00b7\nGold mineralisation continues to expand the northeastern zone and infill the central Saddle area.\n\u00b7\nSignificant results following on from previously announced selection intercepts, include:\n\u00b7\n4m @ 4.09 g/t Au from 54m (NZAC174)\n\u00b7\n1m @ 4.15 g/t Au from 46m (NZAC174)\n\u00b7\n1m @ 4.82 g/t Au from 43m (NZAC178)\n\u00b7\n8m @ 1.23 g/t Au from 44m (NZAC188)\n\u00b7\n8m at 5.81 g/t Au from 46m (NZAC179)\n\u00b7\n7m at 3.48 g/t Au from 48m (NZAC181)\n\u00b7\n5m at 3.13 g/t Au from 41m (NZAC170)\n\u00b7\n4m at 2.28 g/t Au from 43m (NZAC182)\n\u00b7\nConversion of the tenement to a mining lease continues on course with the Native Title agreements signing in December 2025 being a major step forward.\n[1]\n\u00b7\nThe Mine Development and Closure Plan (MDCP) and the associated environmental assessments is progressing with Resource WA.\n\u00b7\nRig booked for 10 February, to begin the 2026 drilling campaign to continue expanding the shallow gold footprint.\nNaheed Memon, CEO of Oracle, commented\n:\n\"These latest results, the last of our 2025 drilling campaign, are excellent and continue to excite us and as we continue to enlarge the north-eastern zone gold mineralised zone, and more importantly have confirmed the continuity of the previously undrilled central saddle zone between the eastern and western mineralised zones. Our modelling suggests that this could constitute part of a ~600m wide zone of shallow oxide mineralisation overlying the Northern Zone porphyry system. I would also like to remind shareholders that we have drilled this porphyry to a depth of around 500m\n[2]\nand we anticipate deeper drilling after we start the mining process with MEGA Resources.\n\"Overall, the outcomes from the 2025 drilling have been very effective in enlarging the shallow, oxide gold footprint at our Kalgoorlie Gold Project, and to strengthen the MEGA Resources mining scenario for 2026\n[3]\n. We are consistently achieving the goal of making the Project bigger in the oxide zone and we will continue to make this shallow gold project significantly larger in Q1 and Q2. I look forward to updating shareholders as we progress the Project further.\"\nThe latest drill programme results (Tables 1-3) continue to successfully intersect the mineralised host porphyry over an increasing footprint and consistently validate the broader gold mineralisation model. Gold mineralisation continues to be intersected in the northeastern area, which remains open laterally and at depth (see Figure 2). The recent results have also successfully infilled the central Saddle area, in a previous undrilled area. A key SW-NE cross-section derived from 3D Leapfrog software is illustrated in Figure 3. The interpretation illustrates gold grade shells derived from all the significant intercepts reported to April 2025. The Leapfrog model will be updated in the next few weeks.\nNorthern Zone is hosted within a porphyry unit (Tonalite-Trondhjemite Intrusion, TTI), with high background gold and horizontal gold mineralised units within the TTI unit. The Northern Zone Project sits within the Canon Shear or fault zone, with further drilling required to define the limits of mineralisation identified to date. The horizontal mineralisation makes drilling to date perpendicular to the gold mineralisation, and no water in drilling to a depth of 60 metres makes the TTI also suitable for drilling with the techniques the Company has utilised to date.\nThis drilling will be used by MEGA Resources in their mine planning for our joint plans to start mining in the first half of 2026.\nFor further information on Oracle, visit the Company\n'\ns website at\nhttp://www.oraclepower.co.uk\nor contact\n:\nOracle Power PLC\nNaheed Memon - CEO +44 (0) 203 580 4314\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser & Broker)\nRory Murphy, Matthew Chandler, Rob Patrick +44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nSt Brides Partners Limited (Financial PR)\nSusie Geliher, Will Turner +44 (0) 20 7236 1177\nThis announcement contains inside information for the pur",

When news is due the underling or underlings spam the site with more and more negative messages with your boss monitoring and marking how in touch with the company you really are . All part of the training in my opinion but for an investor like me I've seen 280% gains in a single day when underlings have been bashing for weeks previously . No point in mentioning the company I've just used as an example since that's not how I play your game .",

All good in my opinion but I did top up yesterday at 0.057p /share which I'm not disappointed with since news is due regarding the new drilling program in the Northern Zone . They might even throw in more information with regards to the Northeast Zone and the open pit gold mine, now they have the results they wanted .",

The BOD was obviously waiting for all the 2025 drilling results before deciding how to progress so now they're in it should be straight forward . Also reassuring to see gold back above US$5,000/oz but I'm expecting it to be a lot higher by the end of 2026 with my own expectations being closer US$7,000/oz . So many countries world wide are loading up on it with the US$ importance evaporating in preference to the Yuan for many commodity trades along with other local currencies it's a case of back to what mankind has always done when a fiat currency ends it's world dominance .

With President Trump demanding lower interest rates in the US the Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell held interest rates this time but when Kevin Warsh heads the interest rate board that will change . President Trump selected him for the job of lowering interest rates regardless of America's colossal  debt and sure enough he will forcing countries like Japan , China , etc . to carry on selling American debt to load up on bullion . To assume bullion is doing anything other than rising is very blinkered in my opinion but nothing rises in a straight line not even bullion .",

People dismissed a lot of information because it WASN'T what they wanted to hear, and now, they themselves need to hold accountable for their investment. Here's a recap of the company: The split: Strictly speaking, it's 80/20 split between Riversgold and Oracle. Then it's another 50/50 split from the 20% between Oracle and Mega. So Oracle will only receive 10% of whatever potential find. Oracle projects & running costs: Oracle stated that the initial phase of the Thar Block VI coal and power development carried a gross project cost of about US$1.6 billion. For the Green Hydrogen project, total cost is projected at about US$2 billion. There's also the Blue Rock Valley project and other company expenses to pay. Potential revenue Vs expenses: The Northern Zone has a best case scenario of \u00a3600 million POTENTIAL. Oracle's expenses is absolute, and as announced the Thar project alone will require $1.6billion. The Northern Zone 10% simply isn't going to cut it for Oracle in the long run. Their expenses greatly exceeds any potential income. The fundamentals: 15billion shares issued speaks for itself. Last checked Oracle only has about \u00a3500K and this was in June 2025. Administrative expenses for 6 months is approx \u00a3280K. We are approaching February 2026, it means that Oracle has only approx \u00a3200K left in the bank. Any potential revenue from Northern Zone won't happen immediately whereas the urgency for Oracle to raise will. It's clear as day what will happen next.",

Whilst the experienced will try to buy in as cheaply as possible if the MM's are willing to sell them any .",

At the lower end of the market, these boards are used to encourage the na\u00efve to buy into a stock. There are many who have multi-IDs who then literally have a conversation with themselves, in an attempt to generate excitement around the stock. Should anyone post a contrasting opinion \u2013 they are called out as a \u2018shorter\u2019 or a \u2018deramper\u2019 and are the subject of abuse. Worse still, the group encourages everyone to \u2018report\u2019 the post in an attempt to have the post automatically deleted. This means that anyone viewing the board will only see one positive narrative because the posts that are automatically deleted are not reviewed by anyone. Those who own the bulletin boards don\u2019t care about the actual content of the posts, because they\u2019re not monetising the boards. What they monetise is the volume of traffic on the site, which they then sell in the form of advertisements and impressions. So, while the bulletin boards are free to use, there is almost no point in using them.",

More results due and revenues could come by the end of 2026 from the gold production, that derisks the costs of the company, cash in the coffers gives them a better bargaining tool for the mou for Thar. Oracle Power PLC (AIM: ORCP), a developer of green hydrogen production through its joint venture Oracle Energy Limited (\"Oracle Energy\"), announces a strategic Memorandum of Understanding (\"MoU\") with China Electric Power and Technology Co., Ltd (\"CET\") to potentially develop, finance, construct, operate and maintain Oracle Energy's Green Hydrogen Project in Thatta, Sindh Province, Pakistan (the \"Green Hydrogen Project\"). CET is a wholly-owned subsidiary of State Grid Corporation of China, the largest power producer in the world by revenue in 2021. The MoU with CET, which has a mandate to finance, build, operate and maintain large renewable power generation projects within and outside of China, is focused on accelerating the development of Oracle Energy's Green Hydrogen Project, which includes the construction of a Hybrid Renewable Energy Production and Storage facility, combining 700MW of solar and 500MW of wind power, and battery storage.

          "content": "Small AIM resource stocks like Oracle Power tend to have high risk and volatility, often driven by newsflow and project milestones rather than steady earnings. They are very different from established companies or index stocks. The company has no current commercial revenue and posted a loss in the first half of 2025, continuing a trend of operating losses. Without cash flow, the business depends on equity financing to fund project work. Oracle Power has increased its share count through warrant exercises. This expanded the total issued share capital dramatically. When a company issues new shares into the market, the value of each existing share can be diluted, and that often puts downward pressure on share price. Market summaries list Oracle Power among one of the larger decliners on AIM on recent trading days. Investors should be cautious and do detailed research before investing",

You\u2019re applying 'Blue Chip' logic to a 'Growth Discovery' engine. Let\u2019s address the reality of Oracle Power (ORCP): \"No Revenue\" is the point you claim; they have no commercial revenue. No kidding. Oracle isn't a grocery store; it\u2019s a project incubator. In the junior resource sector, you don't buy for 'earnings'\u2014you buy for asset appreciation. * The Reality: By the time a junior stock has \"steady earnings,\" the share price is already 10x higher. We are here for the re-rating that happens when a prospect becomes a proven mine. 2. Dilution is \"Fuel,\" Not a Leak You mentioned the increase in share count. In mining, cash is the fuel for the drill bit. \u2022 The Winning Argument: Would you rather own 100% of a company with \u00a30 in the bank and no drills in the ground, or a slightly diluted piece of a company that is actually hitting shallow, high-grade gold intercepts in Kalgoorlie? \u2022 The Context: Oracle just expanded its Northern Zone footprint (Jan 2026) and is moving toward production. That \"dilution\" paid for the drills that just increased the value of the ground we own. 3. You\u2019re Looking at the Rear-View Mirror You cited recent \"declines\" on AIM. Smart money looks at forward catalysts, not yesterday\u2019s chart noise. \u2022 The Pipeline: While you\u2019re worried about last week's price, the company has secured a Mining Licence application for Kalgoorlie and an extension on the Green Hydrogen LOI in Pakistan through May 2026. \u2022 The Partnership: We are partnered with Riversgold (ASX:RGL) and State Grid Corporation of China. Global titans don\u2019t sign MoUs with \"failing\" companies; they sign them with companies that hold strategic land. 4. The \"Risk\" is Mispriced You suggest \"caution\" and \"detailed research.\" I agree. Detailed research shows gold is at record highs, and Oracle is sitting on a project in the heart of the Kalgoorlie Super Pit region\u2014the most de-risked mining jurisdiction on earth. Bottom Line: You\u2019re describing the nature of the AIM market as if it\u2019s a failure of the company. If you want \"steady earnings\" and \"low volatility,\" go buy a utility company and enjoy your 3% returns. We\u2019re here for the discovery.\" Go back to ramping ALRT you absolute \ud83e\udd21 which is due a placing by the way. Drown her out!",

People dismissed a lot of information because it WASN'T what they wanted to hear, and now, they themselves need to hold accountable for their investment. Here's a recap of the company: The split: Strictly speaking, it's 80/20 split between Riversgold and Oracle. Then it's another 50/50 split from the 20% between Oracle and Mega. So Oracle will only receive 10% of whatever potential find. Oracle projects & running costs: Oracle stated that the initial phase of the Thar Block VI coal and power development carried a gross project cost of about US$1.6 billion. For the Green Hydrogen project, total cost is projected at about US$2 billion. There's also the Blue Rock Valley project and other company expenses to pay. Potential revenue Vs expenses: The Northern Zone has a best case scenario of \u00a3600 million POTENTIAL. Oracle's expenses is absolute, and as announced the Thar project alone will require $1.6billion. The Northern Zone 10% simply isn't going to cut it for Oracle in the long run. Their expenses greatly exceeds any potential income. The fundamentals: 15billion shares issued speaks for itself. Last checked Oracle only has about \u00a3500K and this was in June 2025. Administrative expenses for 6 months is approx \u00a3280K. We are approaching February 2026, it means that Oracle has only approx \u00a3200K left in the bank. Any potential revenue from Northern Zone won't happen immediately whereas the urgency for Oracle to raise will. It's clear as day what will happen next.",

They are very different from established companies or index stocks. The company has no current commercial revenue and posted a loss in the first half of 2025, continuing a trend of operating losses. Without cash flow, the business depends on equity financing to fund project work. Oracle Power has increased its share count through warrant exercises. This expanded the total issued share capital dramatically. When a company issues new shares into the market, the value of each existing share can be diluted, and that often puts downward pressure on share price. Market summaries list Oracle Power among one of the larger decliners on AIM on recent trading days. Investors should be cautious and do detailed research before investing",

Gold is flirting with that magical US$5000 an ounce mark (around A$7300), on track to effectively double in price in little over a year. Our Runners this week carry a distinctly geopolitical flavour, dominated by gold plays and critical minerals names. The ASX is once again paying rapt attention, with juniors and producers alike catching the tailwind from this macro madness. No green dreams here - just hard assets in a world that\u2019s rediscovering their value the old-fashioned way\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 RIVERSGOLD LTD (ASX: RGL) Up 109% (1.1c \u2013 2.3c) Rounding out our Runners this week is near-term gold producer Riversgold Limited, which unveiled shallow high-grade gold hits from its Kalgoorlie project, accompanied by a recent strategic $2.15 million capital raising at 1 cent per share. The company struck high-grade gold in 21 holes at its Northern Zone gold development in Western Australia. Drilling intersected the mineralised host porphyry across the north-east, west and east zones, expanding the footprint and lending further weight to the company\u2019s broader gold model. Best intercepts included 8m at 5.81g/t gold from 46m, 7m at 3.48g/t from 48m and 5m at 3.13g/t from 41m. Riversgold says modelling points to a 600m-wide zone of shallow oxide mineralisation sitting above the Northern Zone porphyry system. The good news kept coming. Kalgoorlie development partner MEGA Resources will tip in $1 million via a placement for 100 million shares. Under an agreement signed in September, MEGA will fund the project and provide geological, engineering, project management, mining and haulage services, with profits split 50:50. MEGA will also recycle 10 per cent of its monthly proceeds into expansion-grade control and step-out drilling. Riversgold says it will continue refining its understanding of the Kalgoorlie project ahead of a maiden resource estimate, with MEGA already factoring the latest data into mine planning for a first-half 2026 start.",

I'm sure the area to be drilled or further drilled is known by the BOD by now hence I'm expecting an RNS over the coming days to explaining this . As for the compilation of the 2025 assay results along with all other known data for the Northeastern area I feel we'll have to wait for the Leapfrog model to be updated in the next couple of weeks to truly appreciate all the drilling work done in this area . Shown in the 2nd February 2026 RNS , fig 3 there's already significant areas over 1g/t au making this highly suitable for an open pit gold mine .  I'm sure the updated Leapfrog model will also be used to speed up the mining license application and get the ball rolling for mining . I treat our resident basher , obviously paid to do this kind of thing , as an unwanted advert and sadly fail to read his posts . Could even be done by Ai for all I know and the poor trainee no longer has an easy ride in the office .... hum .. times are a changing even gold is worth something these days .",

Chinese companies and workers have faced increasing militant attacks and threats in Pakistan, especially in Balochistan and other restive regions. Several high-profile attacks on Chinese engineers and projects have raised the costs and risks of operations, making Beijing more cautious about new commitments. Ongoing political turmoil and governance challenges, including frequent changes in government and policy unpredictability, have undermined investor confidence. This instability makes long-term planning difficult for Chinese firms. Many CPEC projects have been delayed or stalled, with only a portion of the originally planned initiatives completed. This slowdown diminishes momentum and makes Chinese investors hesitant to commit to new phases without clearer returns. As seen evidently, the above points are all relevant to projects like the THAR coal mine and the Green Hydrogen. They have been delayed numerous times already. In summary, China\u2019s investment trajectory in Pakistan has faltered primarily because of rising security risks, political and economic instability in Pakistan. Oracle will still have to financially commit to their parts of the deal even without Chinese support. The only difference now is that the Pakistan energy projects will take longer than anticipated without Chinese technical & financial support, Oracle will still need to fund there share of the pie.",

Not forgetting Naheed Memon, CEO of Oracle, recently commented : \"These latest results, the last of our 2025 drilling campaign, are excellent \" . Then in the same RNS from only 6 days ago : This drilling will be used by MEGA Resources in their mine planning for our joint plans to start mining in the first half of 2026 . From what previous RNS's indicated the remaining 16 drillhole results from the 2025 drilling campaign were to be issued in two RNS's before the 10th February . So time wise the Joint Venture is not only ahead of expected timelines but looks to be tackling many issues at the same time with conversion of the tenement to a mining lease continuing along with the Mine Development and Closure Plan (MDCP) and the associated environmental assessments is progressing with Resource WA.. All progressing nicely . Best news of all is ORCP will receive 10% of profits  from an open pit gold mine in the near term with a partner  MEGA more than capable of producing the goods just by having ownership of 20% of the Northern Zone .  It would be hard to find another small cap company in such a favourable spot but there you go to me this is the place to be .",

People dismissed a lot of information because it WASN'T what they wanted to hear, and now, they themselves need to hold accountable for their investment. Here's a recap of the company: The split: Strictly speaking, it's 80/20 split between Riversgold and Oracle. Then it's another 50/50 split from the 20% between Oracle and Mega. So Oracle will only receive 10% of whatever potential find. Oracle projects & running costs: Oracle stated that the initial phase of the Thar Block VI coal and power development carried a gross project cost of about US$1.6 billion. For the Green Hydrogen project, total cost is projected at about US$2 billion. There's also the Blue Rock Valley project and other company expenses to pay. Potential revenue Vs expenses: The Northern Zone has a best case scenario of \u00a3600 million POTENTIAL. Oracle's expenses is absolute, and as announced the Thar project alone will require $1.6billion. The Northern Zone 10% simply isn't going to cut it for Oracle in the long run. Their expenses greatly exceeds any potential income. The fundamentals: 15billion shares issued speaks for itself. Last checked Oracle only has about \u00a3500K and this was in June 2025. Administrative expenses for 6 months is approx \u00a3280K. We are approaching February 2026, it means that Oracle has only approx \u00a3200K left in the bank. Any potential revenue from Northern Zone won't happen immediately whereas the urgency for Oracle to raise will. It's clear as day what will happen next.",

When news is due the underling or underlings spam the site with more and more negative messages with your boss monitoring and marking how in touch with the company you really are . All part of the training in my opinion but for an investor like me I've seen 280% gains in a single day when underlings have been bashing for weeks previously . No point in mentioning the company I've just used as an example since that's not how I play your game .",

When news is due the underling or underlings spam the site with more and more negative messages with your boss monitoring and marking how in touch with the company you really are . All part of the training in my opinion but for an investor like me I've seen 280% gains in a single day when underlings have been bashing for weeks previously . No point in mentioning the company I've just used as an example since that's not how I play your game .",

All good in my opinion but I did top up yesterday at 0.057p /share which I'm not disappointed with since news is due regarding the new drilling program in the Northern Zone . They might even throw in more information with regards to the Northeast Zone and the open pit gold mine, now they have the results they wanted .",

The BOD was obviously waiting for all the 2025 drilling results before deciding how to progress so now they're in it should be straight forward . Also reassuring to see gold back above US$5,000/oz but I'm expecting it to be a lot higher by the end of 2026 with my own expectations being closer US$7,000/oz . So many countries world wide are loading up on it with the US$ importance evaporating in preference to the Yuan for many commodity trades along with other local currencies it's a case of back to what mankind has always done when a fiat currency ends it's world dominance .

With President Trump demanding lower interest rates in the US the Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell held interest rates this time but when Kevin Warsh heads the interest rate board that will change . President Trump selected him for the job of lowering interest rates regardless of America's colossal  debt and sure enough he will forcing countries like Japan , China , etc . to carry on selling American debt to load up on bullion . To assume bullion is doing anything other than rising is very blinkered in my opinion but nothing rises in a straight line not even bullion .",

People dismissed a lot of information because it WASN'T what they wanted to hear, and now, they themselves need to hold accountable for their investment. Here's a recap of the company: The split: Strictly speaking, it's 80/20 split between Riversgold and Oracle. Then it's another 50/50 split from the 20% between Oracle and Mega. So Oracle will only receive 10% of whatever potential find. Oracle projects & running costs: Oracle stated that the initial phase of the Thar Block VI coal and power development carried a gross project cost of about US$1.6 billion. For the Green Hydrogen project, total cost is projected at about US$2 billion. There's also the Blue Rock Valley project and other company expenses to pay. Potential revenue Vs expenses: The Northern Zone has a best case scenario of \u00a3600 million POTENTIAL. Oracle's expenses is absolute, and as announced the Thar project alone will require $1.6billion. The Northern Zone 10% simply isn't going to cut it for Oracle in the long run. Their expenses greatly exceeds any potential income. The fundamentals: 15billion shares issued speaks for itself. Last checked Oracle only has about \u00a3500K and this was in June 2025. Administrative expenses for 6 months is approx \u00a3280K. We are approaching February 2026, it means that Oracle has only approx \u00a3200K left in the bank. Any potential revenue from Northern Zone won't happen immediately whereas the urgency for Oracle to raise will. It's clear as day what will happen next.",

Hence is it a surprise the MM's went fishing for stop loses with Riversgold Ltd (RGL) last night ? With company making news being delivered in every RNS it doesn't surprise me one bit .

Whilst the experienced will try to buy in as cheaply as possible if the MM's are willing to sell them any .",

At the lower end of the market, these boards are used to encourage the na\u00efve to buy into a stock. There are many who have multi-IDs who then literally have a conversation with themselves, in an attempt to generate excitement around the stock. Should anyone post a contrasting opinion \u2013 they are called out as a \u2018shorter\u2019 or a \u2018deramper\u2019 and are the subject of abuse. Worse still, the group encourages everyone to \u2018report\u2019 the post in an attempt to have the post automatically deleted. This means that anyone viewing the board will only see one positive narrative because the posts that are automatically deleted are not reviewed by anyone. Those who own the bulletin boards don\u2019t care about the actual content of the posts, because they\u2019re not monetising the boards. What they monetise is the volume of traffic on the site, which they then sell in the form of advertisements and impressions. So, while the bulletin boards are free to use, there is almost no point in using them.",

More results due and revenues could come by the end of 2026 from the gold production, that derisks the costs of the company, cash in the coffers gives them a better bargaining tool for the mou for Thar. Oracle Power PLC (AIM: ORCP), a developer of green hydrogen production through its joint venture Oracle Energy Limited (\"Oracle Energy\"), announces a strategic Memorandum of Understanding (\"MoU\") with China Electric Power and Technology Co., Ltd (\"CET\") to potentially develop, finance, construct, operate and maintain Oracle Energy's Green Hydrogen Project in Thatta, Sindh Province, Pakistan (the \"Green Hydrogen Project\"). CET is a wholly-owned subsidiary of State Grid Corporation of China, the largest power producer in the world by revenue in 2021. The MoU with CET, which has a mandate to finance, build, operate and maintain large renewable power generation projects within and outside of China, is focused on accelerating the development of Oracle Energy's Green Hydrogen Project, which includes the construction of a Hybrid Renewable Energy Production and Storage facility, combining 700MW of solar and 500MW of wind power, and battery storage.

          "content": "Small AIM resource stocks like Oracle Power tend to have high risk and volatility, often driven by newsflow and project milestones rather than steady earnings. They are very different from established companies or index stocks. The company has no current commercial revenue and posted a loss in the first half of 2025, continuing a trend of operating losses. Without cash flow, the business depends on equity financing to fund project work. Oracle Power has increased its share count through warrant exercises. This expanded the total issued share capital dramatically. When a company issues new shares into the market, the value of each existing share can be diluted, and that often puts downward pressure on share price. Market summaries list Oracle Power among one of the larger decliners on AIM on recent trading days. Investors should be cautious and do detailed research before investing",

You\u2019re applying 'Blue Chip' logic to a 'Growth Discovery' engine. Let\u2019s address the reality of Oracle Power (ORCP): \"No Revenue\" is the point you claim; they have no commercial revenue. No kidding. Oracle isn't a grocery store; it\u2019s a project incubator. In the junior resource sector, you don't buy for 'earnings'\u2014you buy for asset appreciation. * The Reality: By the time a junior stock has \"steady earnings,\" the share price is already 10x higher. We are here for the re-rating that happens when a prospect becomes a proven mine. 2. Dilution is \"Fuel,\" Not a Leak You mentioned the increase in share count. In mining, cash is the fuel for the drill bit. \u2022 The Winning Argument: Would you rather own 100% of a company with \u00a30 in the bank and no drills in the ground, or a slightly diluted piece of a company that is actually hitting shallow, high-grade gold intercepts in Kalgoorlie? \u2022 The Context: Oracle just expanded its Northern Zone footprint (Jan 2026) and is moving toward production. That \"dilution\" paid for the drills that just increased the value of the ground we own. 3. You\u2019re Looking at the Rear-View Mirror You cited recent \"declines\" on AIM. Smart money looks at forward catalysts, not yesterday\u2019s chart noise. \u2022 The Pipeline: While you\u2019re worried about last week's price, the company has secured a Mining Licence application for Kalgoorlie and an extension on the Green Hydrogen LOI in Pakistan through May 2026. \u2022 The Partnership: We are partnered with Riversgold (ASX:RGL) and State Grid Corporation of China. Global titans don\u2019t sign MoUs with \"failing\" companies; they sign them with companies that hold strategic land. 4. The \"Risk\" is Mispriced You suggest \"caution\" and \"detailed research.\" I agree. Detailed research shows gold is at record highs, and Oracle is sitting on a project in the heart of the Kalgoorlie Super Pit region\u2014the most de-risked mining jurisdiction on earth. Bottom Line: You\u2019re describing the nature of the AIM market as if it\u2019s a failure of the company. If you want \"steady earnings\" and \"low volatility,\" go buy a utility company and enjoy your 3% returns. We\u2019re here for the discovery.\" Go back to ramping ALRT you absolute \ud83e\udd21 which is due a placing by the way. Drown her out!",

People dismissed a lot of information because it WASN'T what they wanted to hear, and now, they themselves need to hold accountable for their investment. Here's a recap of the company: The split: Strictly speaking, it's 80/20 split between Riversgold and Oracle. Then it's another 50/50 split from the 20% between Oracle and Mega. So Oracle will only receive 10% of whatever potential find. Oracle projects & running costs: Oracle stated that the initial phase of the Thar Block VI coal and power development carried a gross project cost of about US$1.6 billion. For the Green Hydrogen project, total cost is projected at about US$2 billion. There's also the Blue Rock Valley project and other company expenses to pay. Potential revenue Vs expenses: The Northern Zone has a best case scenario of \u00a3600 million POTENTIAL. Oracle's expenses is absolute, and as announced the Thar project alone will require $1.6billion. The Northern Zone 10% simply isn't going to cut it for Oracle in the long run. Their expenses greatly exceeds any potential income. The fundamentals: 15billion shares issued speaks for itself. Last checked Oracle only has about \u00a3500K and this was in June 2025. Administrative expenses for 6 months is approx \u00a3280K. We are approaching February 2026, it means that Oracle has only approx \u00a3200K left in the bank. Any potential revenue from Northern Zone won't happen immediately whereas the urgency for Oracle to raise will. It's clear as day what will happen next.",

They are very different from established companies or index stocks. The company has no current commercial revenue and posted a loss in the first half of 2025, continuing a trend of operating losses. Without cash flow, the business depends on equity financing to fund project work. Oracle Power has increased its share count through warrant exercises. This expanded the total issued share capital dramatically. When a company issues new shares into the market, the value of each existing share can be diluted, and that often puts downward pressure on share price. Market summaries list Oracle Power among one of the larger decliners on AIM on recent trading days. Investors should be cautious and do detailed research before investing",

Gold is flirting with that magical US$5000 an ounce mark (around A$7300), on track to effectively double in price in little over a year. Our Runners this week carry a distinctly geopolitical flavour, dominated by gold plays and critical minerals names. The ASX is once again paying rapt attention, with juniors and producers alike catching the tailwind from this macro madness. No green dreams here - just hard assets in a world that\u2019s rediscovering their value the old-fashioned way\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 RIVERSGOLD LTD (ASX: RGL) Up 109% (1.1c \u2013 2.3c) Rounding out our Runners this week is near-term gold producer Riversgold Limited, which unveiled shallow high-grade gold hits from its Kalgoorlie project, accompanied by a recent strategic $2.15 million capital raising at 1 cent per share. The company struck high-grade gold in 21 holes at its Northern Zone gold development in Western Australia. Drilling intersected the mineralised host porphyry across the north-east, west and east zones, expanding the footprint and lending further weight to the company\u2019s broader gold model. Best intercepts included 8m at 5.81g/t gold from 46m, 7m at 3.48g/t from 48m and 5m at 3.13g/t from 41m. Riversgold says modelling points to a 600m-wide zone of shallow oxide mineralisation sitting above the Northern Zone porphyry system. The good news kept coming. Kalgoorlie development partner MEGA Resources will tip in $1 million via a placement for 100 million shares. Under an agreement signed in September, MEGA will fund the project and provide geological, engineering, project management, mining and haulage services, with profits split 50:50. MEGA will also recycle 10 per cent of its monthly proceeds into expansion-grade control and step-out drilling. Riversgold says it will continue refining its understanding of the Kalgoorlie project ahead of a maiden resource estimate, with MEGA already factoring the latest data into mine planning for a first-half 2026 start.",

          "content": "Oldsharedog Here's my tuppence Northern Zone Gold Project Co-Operation Agreement , line taken from the RNS 30th Sept 2025 : \u00b7 MEGA Resources is aiming to break ground during the first quarter of 2026, subject to the Project Owners gaining all the final tenement permissions, mining approvals and the signing of a binding Ore Purchase Agreement with a third-party processing mill. Most recent RNS 2nd February 2026 : This drilling will be used by MEGA Resources in their mine planning for our joint plans to start mining in the first half of 2026. Now the main point for me is the Profit spit : \u00b7 MEGA Resources and BGR will share profits equally (50/50) from operations with the Project Owners. Equal to , 50% MEGA Resources - 40% Rivergold - 10% ORCP The the next line \u00b7 10% of monthly profits (funded on a 50/50 basis) will be reinvested back into grade control and step out drilling. Expanding the mine revenue stream in doing so but look at the cost to each company 5% MEGA Resources 4% Rivergold 1% ORCP Meaning our Northern Zone open pit gold mine is going to expand big time very quickly and whilst ORCP only get 9% of profits generated after the 1% re-investment money is taken away , for an AIM listed company with a Market Cap of approx. \u00a39m that will mean it will either quickly rerate or leave it open to a take over . Either way the Market Cap will fly .",

But when you get announcement for example : we can announced the start of production is tomorrow - rather than - the start of production is planned in 12 mths time - it has a greater gravitas & impact on the SP.

ORCP have also stated in a recent RNS that production is likely before the end of 2026.   It all looks very promising: Highlights: \u00b7 The Northern Zone is owned 80% by ASX listed Riversgold and 20% by Oracle (\"Project Owners\") as set out in the Earn-in Agreement between the Project Owners in May 2023, with the JV agreement to be documented by 31 December 2025 latest. \u00b7 Riversgold has signed on the Project Owners behalf, a Right to Mine and Co-Operation Agreement with established WA Goldfields mining services provider MEGA Resources for full project funding, mining, and haulage services at its Northern Zone. \u00b7 MEGA Resources is a full-service mining contractor that will now be providing all of the funding for the operation, through BGR Pty; MEGA Resources will also provide geological and engineering services and manage project approvals. \u00b7 Mega Resources has a partnership with mining giant BGR Mining & Infra Limited, which owns BGR Pty, and which will provide funding for mining operations at the Northern Zone. \u00b7 No upfront funding is required from the Project Owners. \u00b7 MEGA Resources and BGR will share profits equally (50/50) from operations with the Project Owners. \u00b7 10% of monthly profits (funded on a 50/50 basis) will be reinvested back into grade control and step out drilling. \u00b7 MEGA Resources is aiming to break ground during the first quarter of 2026, subject to the Project Owners gaining all the final tenement permissions, mining approvals and the signing of a binding Ore Purchase Agreement with a third-party processing mill. \u00b7 The Northern Zone drilling has already identified a gold mineralised porphyry around 600m wide and around 500m deep from diamond drilling[1]. \u00b7 New Northern Zone drilling programmes are being planned to test extensions of known gold mineralisation. Under the MEGA Resources Agreement, MEGA Resources and BGR Pty will pay for 100% of the costs to develop and mine at the Northern Zone, including paying for all ancillary activities (which incorporates haulage of material to the point of sale, maintenance of haul roads and processing costs). In return for MEGA Resources paying for all of the upfront costs at Northern Zone, any profit generated from this partnership will be split 50%/50% with the Project Owners. In May 2023, Oracle and Riversgold signed an earn-in agreement with and Riversgold immediately embarked on a drilling program with first results announced in August 2023. In February 2025, Riversgold exercised its option to acquire an 80% interest in the Northern Zone with Oracle retaining the remaining 20%. Oracle's holding will remain unchanged with the MEGA Resources Agreement.",

I'm sure the area to be drilled or further drilled is known by the BOD by now hence I'm expecting an RNS over the coming days to explaining this . As for the compilation of the 2025 assay results along with all other known data for the Northeastern area I feel we'll have to wait for the Leapfrog model to be updated in the next couple of weeks to truly appreciate all the drilling work done in this area . Shown in the 2nd February 2026 RNS , fig 3 there's already significant areas over 1g/t au making this highly suitable for an open pit gold mine .  I'm sure the updated Leapfrog model will also be used to speed up the mining license application and get the ball rolling for mining . I treat our resident basher , obviously paid to do this kind of thing , as an unwanted advert and sadly fail to read his posts . Could even be done by Ai for all I know and the poor trainee no longer has an easy ride in the office .... hum .. times are a changing even gold is worth something these days .",

I'm sure the area to be drilled or further drilled is known by the BOD by now hence I'm expecting an RNS over the coming days to explaining this . As for the compilation of the 2025 assay results along with all other known data for the Northeastern area I feel we'll have to wait for the Leapfrog model to be updated in the next couple of weeks to truly appreciate all the drilling work done in this area . Shown in the 2nd February 2026 RNS , fig 3 there's already significant areas over 1g/t au making this highly suitable for an open pit gold mine .  I'm sure the updated Leapfrog model will also be used to speed up the mining license application and get the ball rolling for mining . I treat our resident basher , obviously paid to do this kind of thing , as an unwanted advert and sadly fail to read his posts . Could even be done by Ai for all I know and the poor trainee no longer has an easy ride in the office .... hum .. times are a changing even gold is worth something these days .",

          "content": "China\u2019s investment in Pakistan, mainly known as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) under the Belt and Road Initiative has slowed and worsened in recent years for a combination of economic, political, security, and strategic reasons. Chinese companies and workers have faced increasing militant attacks and threats in Pakistan, especially in Balochistan and other restive regions. Several high-profile attacks on Chinese engineers and projects have raised the costs and risks of operations, making Beijing more cautious about new commitments. Ongoing political turmoil and governance challenges, including frequent changes in government and policy unpredictability, have undermined investor confidence. This instability makes long-term planning difficult for Chinese firms. Many CPEC projects have been delayed or stalled, with only a portion of the originally planned initiatives completed. This slowdown diminishes momentum and makes Chinese investors hesitant to commit to new phases without clearer returns. As seen evidently, the above points are all relevant to projects like the THAR coal mine and the Green Hydrogen. They have been delayed numerous times already. In summary, China\u2019s investment trajectory in Pakistan has faltered primarily because of rising security risks, political and economic instability in Pakistan. Oracle will still have to financially commit to their parts of the deal even without Chinese support. The only difference now is that the Pakistan energy projects will take longer than anticipated without Chinese technical & financial support, Oracle will still need to fund there share of the pie.",

From what previous RNS's indicated the remaining 16 drillhole results from the 2025 drilling campaign were to be issued in two RNS's before the 10th February . So time wise the Joint Venture is not only ahead of expected timelines but looks to be tackling many issues at the same time with conversion of the tenement to a mining lease continuing along with the Mine Development and Closure Plan (MDCP) and the associated environmental assessments is progressing with Resource WA.. All progressing nicely . Best news of all is ORCP will receive 10% of profits  from an open pit gold mine in the near term with a partner  MEGA more than capable of producing the goods just by having ownership of 20% of the Northern Zone .  It would be hard to find another small cap company in such a favourable spot but there you go to me this is the place to be .",

People dismissed a lot of information because it WASN'T what they wanted to hear, and now, they themselves need to hold accountable for their investment. Here's a recap of the company: The split: Strictly speaking, it's 80/20 split between Riversgold and Oracle. Then it's another 50/50 split from the 20% between Oracle and Mega. So Oracle will only receive 10% of whatever potential find. Oracle projects & running costs: Oracle stated that the initial phase of the Thar Block VI coal and power development carried a gross project cost of about US$1.6 billion. For the Green Hydrogen project, total cost is projected at about US$2 billion. There's also the Blue Rock Valley project and other company expenses to pay. Potential revenue Vs expenses: The Northern Zone has a best case scenario of \u00a3600 million POTENTIAL. Oracle's expenses is absolute, and as announced the Thar project alone will require $1.6billion. The Northern Zone 10% simply isn't going to cut it for Oracle in the long run. Their expenses greatly exceeds any potential income. The fundamentals: 15billion shares issued speaks for itself. Last checked Oracle only has about \u00a3500K and this was in June 2025. Administrative expenses for 6 months is approx \u00a3280K. We are approaching February 2026, it means that Oracle has only approx \u00a3200K left in the bank. Any potential revenue from Northern Zone won't happen immediately whereas the urgency for Oracle to raise will. It's clear as day what will happen next.",

When news is due the underling or underlings spam the site with more and more negative messages with your boss monitoring and marking how in touch with the company you really are . All part of the training in my opinion but for an investor like me I've seen 280% gains in a single day when underlings have been bashing for weeks previously . No point in mentioning the company I've just used as an example since that's not how I play your game .",

When news is due the underling or underlings spam the site with more and more negative messages with your boss monitoring and marking how in touch with the company you really are . All part of the training in my opinion but for an investor like me I've seen 280% gains in a single day when underlings have been bashing for weeks previously . No point in mentioning the company I've just used as an example since that's not how I play your game .",

The BOD was obviously waiting for all the 2025 drilling results before deciding how to progress so now they're in it should be straight forward . Also reassuring to see gold back above US$5,000/oz but I'm expecting it to be a lot higher by the end of 2026 with my own expectations being closer US$7,000/oz . So many countries world wide are loading up on it with the US$ importance evaporating in preference to the Yuan for many commodity trades along with other local currencies it's a case of back to what mankind has always done when a fiat currency ends it's world dominance .

As for gold price movement today it's probably related to another country buying which most countries have been doing as they offload their US dollars . With President Trump demanding lower interest rates in the US the Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell held interest rates this time but when Kevin Warsh heads the interest rate board that will change . President Trump selected him for the job of lowering interest rates regardless of America's colossal  debt and sure enough he will forcing countries like Japan , China , etc . to carry on selling American debt to load up on bullion . To assume bullion is doing anything other than rising is very blinkered in my opinion but nothing rises in a straight line not even bullion .",

          "content": "Many people have been sucked into the hype without knowing what the company is about, and now, they are feeling agitated, and not accepting responsibility for their own investment decisions. People dismissed a lot of information because it WASN'T what they wanted to hear, and now, they themselves need to hold accountable for their investment. Here's a recap of the company: The split: Strictly speaking, it's 80/20 split between Riversgold and Oracle. Then it's another 50/50 split from the 20% between Oracle and Mega. So Oracle will only receive 10% of whatever potential find. Oracle projects & running costs: Oracle stated that the initial phase of the Thar Block VI coal and power development carried a gross project cost of about US$1.6 billion. For the Green Hydrogen project, total cost is projected at about US$2 billion. There's also the Blue Rock Valley project and other company expenses to pay. Potential revenue Vs expenses: The Northern Zone has a best case scenario of \u00a3600 million POTENTIAL. Oracle's expenses is absolute, and as announced the Thar project alone will require $1.6billion. The Northern Zone 10% simply isn't going to cut it for Oracle in the long run. Their expenses greatly exceeds any potential income. The fundamentals: 15billion shares issued speaks for itself. Last checked Oracle only has about \u00a3500K and this was in June 2025. Administrative expenses for 6 months is approx \u00a3280K. We are approaching February 2026, it means that Oracle has only approx \u00a3200K left in the bank. Any potential revenue from Northern Zone won't happen immediately whereas the urgency for Oracle to raise will. It's clear as day what will happen next.",

Hence is it a surprise the MM's went fishing for stop loses with Riversgold Ltd (RGL) last night ? With company making news being delivered in every RNS it doesn't surprise me one bit .  So looking forwards to next week might be worth reminding ourselves the MM's will always shake the unresearched , novice traders out before more good news is due . Whilst the experienced will try to buy in as cheaply as possible if the MM's are willing to sell them any .",

Even the interviewer sounded frustrated with the continuous delays and the scripted responses from Naheed. It felt like an interrogation at some point and you can literally hear Naheed's voice shaking when being questioned about progress and value realisation. The interview wasn't a showcase of confidence, it highlighted the lack of preparation, company strategies or any kind of forward plans. Listening to Naheed getting roasted doesn't really boost confidence for shareholders and potential investors. https://youtu.be/3racQO34g7s?si=ltQ0V-yQcy2XDhs_ In my honest opinion",

There are many who have multi-IDs who then literally have a conversation with themselves, in an attempt to generate excitement around the stock. Should anyone post a contrasting opinion \u2013 they are called out as a \u2018shorter\u2019 or a \u2018deramper\u2019 and are the subject of abuse. Worse still, the group encourages everyone to \u2018report\u2019 the post in an attempt to have the post automatically deleted. This means that anyone viewing the board will only see one positive narrative because the posts that are automatically deleted are not reviewed by anyone. Those who own the bulletin boards don\u2019t care about the actual content of the posts, because they\u2019re not monetising the boards. What they monetise is the volume of traffic on the site, which they then sell in the form of advertisements and impressions. So, while the bulletin boards are free to use, there is almost no point in using them.",

They are very different from established companies or index stocks. The company has no current commercial revenue and posted a loss in the first half of 2025, continuing a trend of operating losses. Without cash flow, the business depends on equity financing to fund project work. Oracle Power has increased its share count through warrant exercises. This expanded the total issued share capital dramatically. When a company issues new shares into the market, the value of each existing share can be diluted, and that often puts downward pressure on share price. Market summaries list Oracle Power among one of the larger decliners on AIM on recent trading days. Investors should be cautious and do detailed research before investing",

You\u2019re applying 'Blue Chip' logic to a 'Growth Discovery' engine. Let\u2019s address the reality of Oracle Power (ORCP): \"No Revenue\" is the point you claim; they have no commercial revenue. No kidding. Oracle isn't a grocery store; it\u2019s a project incubator. In the junior resource sector, you don't buy for 'earnings'\u2014you buy for asset appreciation. * The Reality: By the time a junior stock has \"steady earnings,\" the share price is already 10x higher. We are here for the re-rating that happens when a prospect becomes a proven mine. 2. Dilution is \"Fuel,\" Not a Leak You mentioned the increase in share count. In mining, cash is the fuel for the drill bit. \u2022 The Winning Argument: Would you rather own 100% of a company with \u00a30 in the bank and no drills in the ground, or a slightly diluted piece of a company that is actually hitting shallow, high-grade gold intercepts in Kalgoorlie? \u2022 The Context: Oracle just expanded its Northern Zone footprint (Jan 2026) and is moving toward production. That \"dilution\" paid for the drills that just increased the value of the ground we own. 3. You\u2019re Looking at the Rear-View Mirror You cited recent \"declines\" on AIM. Smart money looks at forward catalysts, not yesterday\u2019s chart noise. \u2022 The Pipeline: While you\u2019re worried about last week's price, the company has secured a Mining Licence application for Kalgoorlie and an extension on the Green Hydrogen LOI in Pakistan through May 2026. \u2022 The Partnership: We are partnered with Riversgold (ASX:RGL) and State Grid Corporation of China. Global titans don\u2019t sign MoUs with \"failing\" companies; they sign them with companies that hold strategic land. 4. The \"Risk\" is Mispriced You suggest \"caution\" and \"detailed research.\" I agree. Detailed research shows gold is at record highs, and Oracle is sitting on a project in the heart of the Kalgoorlie Super Pit region\u2014the most de-risked mining jurisdiction on earth. Bottom Line: You\u2019re describing the nature of the AIM market as if it\u2019s a failure of the company. If you want \"steady earnings\" and \"low volatility,\" go buy a utility company and enjoy your 3% returns. We\u2019re here for the discovery.\" Go back to ramping ALRT you absolute \ud83e\udd21 which is due a placing by the way. Drown her out!",

People dismissed a lot of information because it WASN'T what they wanted to hear, and now, they themselves need to hold accountable for their investment. Here's a recap of the company: The split: Strictly speaking, it's 80/20 split between Riversgold and Oracle. Then it's another 50/50 split from the 20% between Oracle and Mega. So Oracle will only receive 10% of whatever potential find. Oracle projects & running costs: Oracle stated that the initial phase of the Thar Block VI coal and power development carried a gross project cost of about US$1.6 billion. For the Green Hydrogen project, total cost is projected at about US$2 billion. There's also the Blue Rock Valley project and other company expenses to pay. Potential revenue Vs expenses: The Northern Zone has a best case scenario of \u00a3600 million POTENTIAL. Oracle's expenses is absolute, and as announced the Thar project alone will require $1.6billion. The Northern Zone 10% simply isn't going to cut it for Oracle in the long run. Their expenses greatly exceeds any potential income. The fundamentals: 15billion shares issued speaks for itself. Last checked Oracle only has about \u00a3500K and this was in June 2025. Administrative expenses for 6 months is approx \u00a3280K. We are approaching February 2026, it means that Oracle has only approx \u00a3200K left in the bank. Any potential revenue from Northern Zone won't happen immediately whereas the urgency for Oracle to raise will. It's clear as day what will happen next.",

In the junior resource sector, you don't buy for 'earnings'\u2014you buy for asset appreciation. * The Reality: By the time a junior stock has \"steady earnings,\" the share price is already 10x higher. We are here for the re-rating that happens when a prospect becomes a proven mine. 2. Dilution is \"Fuel,\" Not a Leak You mentioned the increase in share count. In mining, cash is the fuel for the drill bit. \u2022 The Winning Argument: Would you rather own 100% of a company with \u00a30 in the bank and no drills in the ground, or a slightly diluted piece of a company that is actually hitting shallow, high-grade gold intercepts in Kalgoorlie? \u2022 The Context: Oracle just expanded its Northern Zone footprint (Jan 2026) and is moving toward production. That \"dilution\" paid for the drills that just increased the value of the ground we own. 3. You\u2019re Looking at the Rear-View Mirror You cited recent \"declines\" on AIM. Smart money looks at forward catalysts, not yesterday\u2019s chart noise. \u2022 The Pipeline: While you\u2019re worried about last week's price, the company has secured a Mining Licence application for Kalgoorlie and an extension on the Green Hydrogen LOI in Pakistan through May 2026. \u2022 The Partnership: We are partnered with Riversgold (ASX:RGL) and State Grid Corporation of China. Global titans don\u2019t sign MoUs with \"failing\" companies; they sign them with companies that hold strategic land. 4. The \"Risk\" is Mispriced You suggest \"caution\" and \"detailed research.\" I agree. Detailed research shows gold is at record highs, and Oracle is sitting on a project in the heart of the Kalgoorlie Super Pit region\u2014the most de-risked mining jurisdiction on earth. Bottom Line: You\u2019re describing the nature of the AIM market as if it\u2019s a failure of the company. If you want \"steady earnings\" and \"low volatility,\" go buy a utility company and enjoy your 3% returns. We\u2019re here for the discovery.\" Go back to ramping ALRT you absolute \ud83e\udd21 which is due a placing by the way.",

          "content": "Small AIM resource stocks like Oracle Power tend to have high risk and volatility, often driven by newsflow and project milestones rather than steady earnings. They are very different from established companies or index stocks. The company has no current commercial revenue and posted a loss in the first half of 2025, continuing a trend of operating losses. Without cash flow, the business depends on equity financing to fund project work. Oracle Power has increased its share count through warrant exercises. This expanded the total issued share capital dramatically. When a company issues new shares into the market, the value of each existing share can be diluted, and that often puts downward pressure on share price. Market summaries list Oracle Power among one of the larger decliners on AIM on recent trading days. Investors should be cautious and do detailed research before investing",

Gold is flirting with that magical US$5000 an ounce mark (around A$7300), on track to effectively double in price in little over a year. Our Runners this week carry a distinctly geopolitical flavour, dominated by gold plays and critical minerals names. The ASX is once again paying rapt attention, with juniors and producers alike catching the tailwind from this macro madness. No green dreams here - just hard assets in a world that\u2019s rediscovering their value the old-fashioned way\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 RIVERSGOLD LTD (ASX: RGL) Up 109% (1.1c \u2013 2.3c) Rounding out our Runners this week is near-term gold producer Riversgold Limited, which unveiled shallow high-grade gold hits from its Kalgoorlie project, accompanied by a recent strategic $2.15 million capital raising at 1 cent per share. The company struck high-grade gold in 21 holes at its Northern Zone gold development in Western Australia. Drilling intersected the mineralised host porphyry across the north-east, west and east zones, expanding the footprint and lending further weight to the company\u2019s broader gold model. Best intercepts included 8m at 5.81g/t gold from 46m, 7m at 3.48g/t from 48m and 5m at 3.13g/t from 41m. Riversgold says modelling points to a 600m-wide zone of shallow oxide mineralisation sitting above the Northern Zone porphyry system. The good news kept coming. Kalgoorlie development partner MEGA Resources will tip in $1 million via a placement for 100 million shares. Under an agreement signed in September, MEGA will fund the project and provide geological, engineering, project management, mining and haulage services, with profits split 50:50. MEGA will also recycle 10 per cent of its monthly proceeds into expansion-grade control and step-out drilling. Riversgold says it will continue refining its understanding of the Kalgoorlie project ahead of a maiden resource estimate, with MEGA already factoring the latest data into mine planning for a first-half 2026 start.",

Once the 40 additional assay results are fed into the 3D leapfrog software due in coming weeks I'm sure they'll be ready to submit plans to acquire the mining license . In same RNS it does state : This drilling will be used by MEGA Resources in their mine planning for our joint plans to start mining in the first half of 2026. It also states we will continue to make this shallow gold project significantly larger in Q1 and Q2 which ties in with the drill arrival on 10th February 2026 in the Northern Zone . After the updated 3D leapfrog I would expect an RNS outlining how many drillholes Rivergold are going to undertake . I may be well off the mark since MEGA Resources may already have plans using data from the latest assay results along with previous data to fast track the mining license . Much bigger organisation with vastly more experience .",

Most recent RNS 2nd February 2026 : This drilling will be used by MEGA Resources in their mine planning for our joint plans to start mining in the first half of 2026. Now the main point for me is the Profit spit : \u00b7 MEGA Resources and BGR will share profits equally (50/50) from operations with the Project Owners. Equal to , 50% MEGA Resources - 40% Rivergold - 10% ORCP The the next line \u00b7 10% of monthly profits (funded on a 50/50 basis) will be reinvested back into grade control and step out drilling. Expanding the mine revenue stream in doing so but look at the cost to each company 5% MEGA Resources 4% Rivergold 1% ORCP Meaning our Northern Zone open pit gold mine is going to expand big time very quickly and whilst ORCP only get 9% of profits generated after the 1% re-investment money is taken away , for an AIM listed company with a Market Cap of approx. \u00a39m that will mean it will either quickly rerate or leave it open to a take over . Either way the Market Cap will fly .",

ORCP have also stated in a recent RNS that production is likely before the end of 2026.   It all looks very promising: Highlights: \u00b7 The Northern Zone is owned 80% by ASX listed Riversgold and 20% by Oracle (\"Project Owners\") as set out in the Earn-in Agreement between the Project Owners in May 2023, with the JV agreement to be documented by 31 December 2025 latest. \u00b7 Riversgold has signed on the Project Owners behalf, a Right to Mine and Co-Operation Agreement with established WA Goldfields mining services provider MEGA Resources for full project funding, mining, and haulage services at its Northern Zone. \u00b7 MEGA Resources is a full-service mining contractor that will now be providing all of the funding for the operation, through BGR Pty; MEGA Resources will also provide geological and engineering services and manage project approvals. \u00b7 Mega Resources has a partnership with mining giant BGR Mining & Infra Limited, which owns BGR Pty, and which will provide funding for mining operations at the Northern Zone. \u00b7 No upfront funding is required from the Project Owners. \u00b7 MEGA Resources and BGR will share profits equally (50/50) from operations with the Project Owners. \u00b7 10% of monthly profits (funded on a 50/50 basis) will be reinvested back into grade control and step out drilling. \u00b7 MEGA Resources is aiming to break ground during the first quarter of 2026, subject to the Project Owners gaining all the final tenement permissions, mining approvals and the signing of a binding Ore Purchase Agreement with a third-party processing mill. \u00b7 The Northern Zone drilling has already identified a gold mineralised porphyry around 600m wide and around 500m deep from diamond drilling[1]. \u00b7 New Northern Zone drilling programmes are being planned to test extensions of known gold mineralisation. Under the MEGA Resources Agreement, MEGA Resources and BGR Pty will pay for 100% of the costs to develop and mine at the Northern Zone, including paying for all ancillary activities (which incorporates haulage of material to the point of sale, maintenance of haul roads and processing costs). In return for MEGA Resources paying for all of the upfront costs at Northern Zone, any profit generated from this partnership will be split 50%/50% with the Project Owners. In May 2023, Oracle and Riversgold signed an earn-in agreement with and Riversgold immediately embarked on a drilling program with first results announced in August 2023.

Most recent RNS 2nd February 2026 : This drilling will be used by MEGA Resources in their mine planning for our joint plans to start mining in the first half of 2026. Now the main point for me is the Profit spit : \u00b7 MEGA Resources and BGR will share profits equally (50/50) from operations with the Project Owners. Equal to , 50% MEGA Resources - 40% Rivergold - 10% ORCP The the next line \u00b7 10% of monthly profits (funded on a 50/50 basis) will be reinvested back into grade control and step out drilling. Expanding the mine revenue stream in doing so but look at the cost to each company 5% MEGA Resources 4% Rivergold 1% ORCP Meaning our Northern Zone open pit gold mine is going to expand big time very quickly and whilst ORCP only get 9% of profits generated after the 1% re-investment money is taken away , for an AIM listed company with a Market Cap of approx. \u00a39m that will mean it will either quickly rerate or leave it open to a take over . Either way the Market Cap will fly .",

It all looks very promising: Highlights: \u00b7 The Northern Zone is owned 80% by ASX listed Riversgold and 20% by Oracle (\"Project Owners\") as set out in the Earn-in Agreement between the Project Owners in May 2023, with the JV agreement to be documented by 31 December 2025 latest. \u00b7 Riversgold has signed on the Project Owners behalf, a Right to Mine and Co-Operation Agreement with established WA Goldfields mining services provider MEGA Resources for full project funding, mining, and haulage services at its Northern Zone. \u00b7 MEGA Resources is a full-service mining contractor that will now be providing all of the funding for the operation, through BGR Pty; MEGA Resources will also provide geological and engineering services and manage project approvals. \u00b7 Mega Resources has a partnership with mining giant BGR Mining & Infra Limited, which owns BGR Pty, and which will provide funding for mining operations at the Northern Zone. \u00b7 No upfront funding is required from the Project Owners. \u00b7 MEGA Resources and BGR will share profits equally (50/50) from operations with the Project Owners. \u00b7 10% of monthly profits (funded on a 50/50 basis) will be reinvested back into grade control and step out drilling. \u00b7 MEGA Resources is aiming to break ground during the first quarter of 2026, subject to the Project Owners gaining all the final tenement permissions, mining approvals and the signing of a binding Ore Purchase Agreement with a third-party processing mill. \u00b7 The Northern Zone drilling has already identified a gold mineralised porphyry around 600m wide and around 500m deep from diamond drilling[1]. \u00b7 New Northern Zone drilling programmes are being planned to test extensions of known gold mineralisation. Under the MEGA Resources Agreement, MEGA Resources and BGR Pty will pay for 100% of the costs to develop and mine at the Northern Zone, including paying for all ancillary activities (which incorporates haulage of material to the point of sale, maintenance of haul roads and processing costs). In return for MEGA Resources paying for all of the upfront costs at Northern Zone, any profit generated from this partnership will be split 50%/50% with the Project Owners. In May 2023, Oracle and Riversgold signed an earn-in agreement with and Riversgold immediately embarked on a drilling program with first results announced in August 2023. In February 2025, Riversgold exercised its option to acquire an 80% interest in the Northern Zone with Oracle retaining the remaining 20%. Oracle's holding will remain unchanged with the MEGA Resources Agreement.",

As for the compilation of the 2025 assay results along with all other known data for the Northeastern area I feel we'll have to wait for the Leapfrog model to be updated in the next couple of weeks to truly appreciate all the drilling work done in this area . Shown in the 2nd February 2026 RNS , fig 3 there's already significant areas over 1g/t au making this highly suitable for an open pit gold mine .  I'm sure the updated Leapfrog model will also be used to speed up the mining license application and get the ball rolling for mining . I treat our resident basher , obviously paid to do this kind of thing , as an unwanted advert and sadly fail to read his posts . Could even be done by Ai for all I know and the poor trainee no longer has an easy ride in the office .... hum .. times are a changing even gold is worth something these days .",

I'm sure the area to be drilled or further drilled is known by the BOD by now hence I'm expecting an RNS over the coming days to explaining this . As for the compilation of the 2025 assay results along with all other known data for the Northeastern area I feel we'll have to wait for the Leapfrog model to be updated in the next couple of weeks to truly appreciate all the drilling work done in this area . Shown in the 2nd February 2026 RNS , fig 3 there's already significant areas over 1g/t au making this highly suitable for an open pit gold mine .  I'm sure the updated Leapfrog model will also be used to speed up the mining license application and get the ball rolling for mining .

Chinese companies and workers have faced increasing militant attacks and threats in Pakistan, especially in Balochistan and other restive regions. Several high-profile attacks on Chinese engineers and projects have raised the costs and risks of operations, making Beijing more cautious about new commitments. Ongoing political turmoil and governance challenges, including frequent changes in government and policy unpredictability, have undermined investor confidence. This instability makes long-term planning difficult for Chinese firms. Many CPEC projects have been delayed or stalled, with only a portion of the originally planned initiatives completed. This slowdown diminishes momentum and makes Chinese investors hesitant to commit to new phases without clearer returns. As seen evidently, the above points are all relevant to projects like the THAR coal mine and the Green Hydrogen. They have been delayed numerous times already. In summary, China\u2019s investment trajectory in Pakistan has faltered primarily because of rising security risks, political and economic instability in Pakistan. Oracle will still have to financially commit to their parts of the deal even without Chinese support. The only difference now is that the Pakistan energy projects will take longer than anticipated without Chinese technical & financial support, Oracle will still need to fund there share of the pie.",

          "content": "A day marked to begin the 2026 drilling campaign to continue expanding the shallow gold footprint . Not forgetting Naheed Memon, CEO of Oracle, recently commented : \"These latest results, the last of our 2025 drilling campaign, are excellent \" . Then in the same RNS from only 6 days ago : This drilling will be used by MEGA Resources in their mine planning for our joint plans to start mining in the first half of 2026 . From what previous RNS's indicated the remaining 16 drillhole results from the 2025 drilling campaign were to be issued in two RNS's before the 10th February . So time wise the Joint Venture is not only ahead of expected timelines but looks to be tackling many issues at the same time with conversion of the tenement to a mining lease continuing along with the Mine Development and Closure Plan (MDCP) and the associated environmental assessments is progressing with Resource WA.. All progressing nicely . Best news of all is ORCP will receive 10% of profits  from an open pit gold mine in the near term with a partner  MEGA more than capable of producing the goods just by having ownership of 20% of the Northern Zone .  It would be hard to find another small cap company in such a favourable spot but there you go to me this is the place to be .",

          "content": "Many people have been sucked into the hype without knowing what the company is about, and now, they are feeling agitated, and not accepting responsibility for their own investment decisions. People dismissed a lot of information because it WASN'T what they wanted to hear, and now, they themselves need to hold accountable for their investment. Here's a recap of the company: The split: Strictly speaking, it's 80/20 split between Riversgold and Oracle. Then it's another 50/50 split from the 20% between Oracle and Mega. So Oracle will only receive 10% of whatever potential find. Oracle projects & running costs: Oracle stated that the initial phase of the Thar Block VI coal and power development carried a gross project cost of about US$1.6 billion. For the Green Hydrogen project, total cost is projected at about US$2 billion. There's also the Blue Rock Valley project and other company expenses to pay. Potential revenue Vs expenses: The Northern Zone has a best case scenario of \u00a3600 million POTENTIAL. Oracle's expenses is absolute, and as announced the Thar project alone will require $1.6billion. The Northern Zone 10% simply isn't going to cut it for Oracle in the long run. Their expenses greatly exceeds any potential income. The fundamentals: 15billion shares issued speaks for itself. Last checked Oracle only has about \u00a3500K and this was in June 2025. Administrative expenses for 6 months is approx \u00a3280K. We are approaching February 2026, it means that Oracle has only approx \u00a3200K left in the bank. Any potential revenue from Northern Zone won't happen immediately whereas the urgency for Oracle to raise will. It's clear as day what will happen next.",

When news is due the underling or underlings spam the site with more and more negative messages with your boss monitoring and marking how in touch with the company you really are . All part of the training in my opinion but for an investor like me I've seen 280% gains in a single day when underlings have been bashing for weeks previously . No point in mentioning the company I've just used as an example since that's not how I play your game .",

When news is due the underling or underlings spam the site with more and more negative messages with your boss monitoring and marking how in touch with the company you really are . All part of the training in my opinion but for an investor like me I've seen 280% gains in a single day when underlings have been bashing for weeks previously . No point in mentioning the company I've just used as an example since that's not how I play your game .",

Then no shares on offer by Halifax under 0.050p /share unless N/T . All good in my opinion but I did top up yesterday at 0.057p /share which I'm not disappointed with since news is due regarding the new drilling program in the Northern Zone . They might even throw in more information with regards to the Northeast Zone and the open pit gold mine, now they have the results they wanted .",

With a rig booked for 10 February, to begin the 2026 drilling campaign to continue expanding the shallow gold footprint . I'm expecting an RNS with further information with regards to outlining more than what has already been communicated via RNS to share holders in coming days . The BOD was obviously waiting for all the 2025 drilling results before deciding how to progress so now they're in it should be straight forward . Also reassuring to see gold back above US$5,000/oz but I'm expecting it to be a lot higher by the end of 2026 with my own expectations being closer US$7,000/oz . So many countries world wide are loading up on it with the US$ importance evaporating in preference to the Yuan for many commodity trades along with other local currencies it's a case of back to what mankind has always done when a fiat currency ends it's world dominance .

As for gold price movement today it's probably related to another country buying which most countries have been doing as they offload their US dollars . With President Trump demanding lower interest rates in the US the Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell held interest rates this time but when Kevin Warsh heads the interest rate board that will change . President Trump selected him for the job of lowering interest rates regardless of America's colossal  debt and sure enough he will forcing countries like Japan , China , etc . to carry on selling American debt to load up on bullion . To assume bullion is doing anything other than rising is very blinkered in my opinion but nothing rises in a straight line not even bullion .",

People dismissed a lot of information because it WASN'T what they wanted to hear, and now, they themselves need to hold accountable for their investment. Here's a recap of the company: The split: Strictly speaking, it's 80/20 split between Riversgold and Oracle. Then it's another 50/50 split from the 20% between Oracle and Mega. So Oracle will only receive 10% of whatever potential find. Oracle projects & running costs: Oracle stated that the initial phase of the Thar Block VI coal and power development carried a gross project cost of about US$1.6 billion. For the Green Hydrogen project, total cost is projected at about US$2 billion. There's also the Blue Rock Valley project and other company expenses to pay. Potential revenue Vs expenses: The Northern Zone has a best case scenario of \u00a3600 million POTENTIAL. Oracle's expenses is absolute, and as announced the Thar project alone will require $1.6billion. The Northern Zone 10% simply isn't going to cut it for Oracle in the long run. Their expenses greatly exceeds any potential income. The fundamentals: 15billion shares issued speaks for itself. Last checked Oracle only has about \u00a3500K and this was in June 2025. Administrative expenses for 6 months is approx \u00a3280K. We are approaching February 2026, it means that Oracle has only approx \u00a3200K left in the bank. Any potential revenue from Northern Zone won't happen immediately whereas the urgency for Oracle to raise will. It's clear as day what will happen next.",

Hence is it a surprise the MM's went fishing for stop loses with Riversgold Ltd (RGL) last night ? With company making news being delivered in every RNS it doesn't surprise me one bit .  So looking forwards to next week might be worth reminding ourselves the MM's will always shake the unresearched , novice traders out before more good news is due . Whilst the experienced will try to buy in as cheaply as possible if the MM's are willing to sell them any .",

There are many who have multi-IDs who then literally have a conversation with themselves, in an attempt to generate excitement around the stock. Should anyone post a contrasting opinion \u2013 they are called out as a \u2018shorter\u2019 or a \u2018deramper\u2019 and are the subject of abuse. Worse still, the group encourages everyone to \u2018report\u2019 the post in an attempt to have the post automatically deleted. This means that anyone viewing the board will only see one positive narrative because the posts that are automatically deleted are not reviewed by anyone. Those who own the bulletin boards don\u2019t care about the actual content of the posts, because they\u2019re not monetising the boards. What they monetise is the volume of traffic on the site, which they then sell in the form of advertisements and impressions. So, while the bulletin boards are free to use, there is almost no point in using them.",

          "content": "Quite amusing reading Stockmaidens posts firstly this is a speculative early stage stock the fact they aren't making revenues yet is irrelevant. Look at ggp in the beginning all small companies raise. Forget the shares in issue its all about the market cap. Will Orcp raise again of course they will but hopefully at a much higher price. More results due and revenues could come by the end of 2026 from the gold production, that derisks the costs of the company, cash in the coffers gives them a better bargaining tool for the mou for Thar. Oracle Power PLC (AIM: ORCP), a developer of green hydrogen production through its joint venture Oracle Energy Limited (\"Oracle Energy\"), announces a strategic Memorandum of Understanding (\"MoU\") with China Electric Power and Technology Co., Ltd (\"CET\") to potentially develop, finance, construct, operate and maintain Oracle Energy's Green Hydrogen Project in Thatta, Sindh Province, Pakistan (the \"Green Hydrogen Project\"). CET is a wholly-owned subsidiary of State Grid Corporation of China, the largest power producer in the world by revenue in 2021. The MoU with CET, which has a mandate to finance, build, operate and maintain large renewable power generation projects within and outside of China, is focused on accelerating the development of Oracle Energy's Green Hydrogen Project, which includes the construction of a Hybrid Renewable Energy Production and Storage facility, combining 700MW of solar and 500MW of wind power, and battery storage. Does anyone know how the Blue rock project is going? Copper is going to be moving a lot higher.",

They are very different from established companies or index stocks. The company has no current commercial revenue and posted a loss in the first half of 2025, continuing a trend of operating losses. Without cash flow, the business depends on equity financing to fund project work. Oracle Power has increased its share count through warrant exercises. This expanded the total issued share capital dramatically. When a company issues new shares into the market, the value of each existing share can be diluted, and that often puts downward pressure on share price. Market summaries list Oracle Power among one of the larger decliners on AIM on recent trading days. Investors should be cautious and do detailed research before investing",

          "content": "\"SM your analysis is a classic case of looking at a race car and complaining it doesn't have enough boot space. You\u2019re applying 'Blue Chip' logic to a 'Growth Discovery' engine. Let\u2019s address the reality of Oracle Power (ORCP): \"No Revenue\" is the point you claim; they have no commercial revenue. No kidding. Oracle isn't a grocery store; it\u2019s a project incubator. In the junior resource sector, you don't buy for 'earnings'\u2014you buy for asset appreciation. * The Reality: By the time a junior stock has \"steady earnings,\" the share price is already 10x higher. We are here for the re-rating that happens when a prospect becomes a proven mine. 2. Dilution is \"Fuel,\" Not a Leak You mentioned the increase in share count. In mining, cash is the fuel for the drill bit. \u2022 The Winning Argument: Would you rather own 100% of a company with \u00a30 in the bank and no drills in the ground, or a slightly diluted piece of a company that is actually hitting shallow, high-grade gold intercepts in Kalgoorlie? \u2022 The Context: Oracle just expanded its Northern Zone footprint (Jan 2026) and is moving toward production. That \"dilution\" paid for the drills that just increased the value of the ground we own. 3. You\u2019re Looking at the Rear-View Mirror You cited recent \"declines\" on AIM. Smart money looks at forward catalysts, not yesterday\u2019s chart noise. \u2022 The Pipeline: While you\u2019re worried about last week's price, the company has secured a Mining Licence application for Kalgoorlie and an extension on the Green Hydrogen LOI in Pakistan through May 2026. \u2022 The Partnership: We are partnered with Riversgold (ASX:RGL) and State Grid Corporation of China. Global titans don\u2019t sign MoUs with \"failing\" companies; they sign them with companies that hold strategic land. 4. The \"Risk\" is Mispriced You suggest \"caution\" and \"detailed research.\" I agree. Detailed research shows gold is at record highs, and Oracle is sitting on a project in the heart of the Kalgoorlie Super Pit region\u2014the most de-risked mining jurisdiction on earth. Bottom Line: You\u2019re describing the nature of the AIM market as if it\u2019s a failure of the company. If you want \"steady earnings\" and \"low volatility,\" go buy a utility company and enjoy your 3% returns. We\u2019re here for the discovery.\" Go back to ramping ALRT you absolute \ud83e\udd21 which is due a placing by the way. Drown her out!",

People dismissed a lot of information because it WASN'T what they wanted to hear, and now, they themselves need to hold accountable for their investment. Here's a recap of the company: The split: Strictly speaking, it's 80/20 split between Riversgold and Oracle. Then it's another 50/50 split from the 20% between Oracle and Mega. So Oracle will only receive 10% of whatever potential find. Oracle projects & running costs: Oracle stated that the initial phase of the Thar Block VI coal and power development carried a gross project cost of about US$1.6 billion. For the Green Hydrogen project, total cost is projected at about US$2 billion. There's also the Blue Rock Valley project and other company expenses to pay. Potential revenue Vs expenses: The Northern Zone has a best case scenario of \u00a3600 million POTENTIAL. Oracle's expenses is absolute, and as announced the Thar project alone will require $1.6billion. The Northern Zone 10% simply isn't going to cut it for Oracle in the long run. Their expenses greatly exceeds any potential income. The fundamentals: 15billion shares issued speaks for itself. Last checked Oracle only has about \u00a3500K and this was in June 2025. Administrative expenses for 6 months is approx \u00a3280K. We are approaching February 2026, it means that Oracle has only approx \u00a3200K left in the bank. Any potential revenue from Northern Zone won't happen immediately whereas the urgency for Oracle to raise will. It's clear as day what will happen next.",

You\u2019re applying 'Blue Chip' logic to a 'Growth Discovery' engine. Let\u2019s address the reality of Oracle Power (ORCP): \"No Revenue\" is the point you claim; they have no commercial revenue. No kidding. Oracle isn't a grocery store; it\u2019s a project incubator. In the junior resource sector, you don't buy for 'earnings'\u2014you buy for asset appreciation. * The Reality: By the time a junior stock has \"steady earnings,\" the share price is already 10x higher. We are here for the re-rating that happens when a prospect becomes a proven mine. 2. Dilution is \"Fuel,\" Not a Leak You mentioned the increase in share count. In mining, cash is the fuel for the drill bit. \u2022 The Winning Argument: Would you rather own 100% of a company with \u00a30 in the bank and no drills in the ground, or a slightly diluted piece of a company that is actually hitting shallow, high-grade gold intercepts in Kalgoorlie? \u2022 The Context: Oracle just expanded its Northern Zone footprint (Jan 2026) and is moving toward production. That \"dilution\" paid for the drills that just increased the value of the ground we own. 3. You\u2019re Looking at the Rear-View Mirror You cited recent \"declines\" on AIM.

They are very different from established companies or index stocks. The company has no current commercial revenue and posted a loss in the first half of 2025, continuing a trend of operating losses. Without cash flow, the business depends on equity financing to fund project work. Oracle Power has increased its share count through warrant exercises. This expanded the total issued share capital dramatically. When a company issues new shares into the market, the value of each existing share can be diluted, and that often puts downward pressure on share price. Market summaries list Oracle Power among one of the larger decliners on AIM on recent trading days. Investors should be cautious and do detailed research before investing",

Gold is flirting with that magical US$5000 an ounce mark (around A$7300), on track to effectively double in price in little over a year. Our Runners this week carry a distinctly geopolitical flavour, dominated by gold plays and critical minerals names. The ASX is once again paying rapt attention, with juniors and producers alike catching the tailwind from this macro madness. No green dreams here - just hard assets in a world that\u2019s rediscovering their value the old-fashioned way\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 RIVERSGOLD LTD (ASX: RGL) Up 109% (1.1c \u2013 2.3c) Rounding out our Runners this week is near-term gold producer Riversgold Limited, which unveiled shallow high-grade gold hits from its Kalgoorlie project, accompanied by a recent strategic $2.15 million capital raising at 1 cent per share. The company struck high-grade gold in 21 holes at its Northern Zone gold development in Western Australia. Drilling intersected the mineralised host porphyry across the north-east, west and east zones, expanding the footprint and lending further weight to the company\u2019s broader gold model. Best intercepts included 8m at 5.81g/t gold from 46m, 7m at 3.48g/t from 48m and 5m at 3.13g/t from 41m. Riversgold says modelling points to a 600m-wide zone of shallow oxide mineralisation sitting above the Northern Zone porphyry system. The good news kept coming. Kalgoorlie development partner MEGA Resources will tip in $1 million via a placement for 100 million shares. Under an agreement signed in September, MEGA will fund the project and provide geological, engineering, project management, mining and haulage services, with profits split 50:50. MEGA will also recycle 10 per cent of its monthly proceeds into expansion-grade control and step-out drilling. Riversgold says it will continue refining its understanding of the Kalgoorlie project ahead of a maiden resource estimate, with MEGA already factoring the latest data into mine planning for a first-half 2026 start.",
