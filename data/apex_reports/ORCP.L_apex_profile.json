Results from a further 16 drillholes are anticipated to be received shortly.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nThe drilling programme has continued to intersect shallow gold mineralisation as drilling expands the gold footprint at the Northern Zone Gold Project.\n\u00b7\nFirst assay results now arriving for 2026, with significant results, including:\n\u00b7\n8m @ 5.81 g/t Au from 46m (NZAC179)\n\u00b7\n7m @ 3.48 g/t Au from 48m (NZAC181)\n\u00b7\n5m @ 3.13 g/t Au from 41m (NZAC170)\n\u00b7\n4m @ 2.28 g/t Au from 43m (NZAC182)\n\u00b7\nFurther significant results shown in tables below\n\u00b7\nDrilling results from a further 16 drillholes due to be received in two batches over the coming weeks.\n\u00b7\nDrill rig booked for 10 February aiming to continue expanding the oxide gold mineralisation footprint.\n\u00b7\nConversion to Mining Lease process continues with the Heritage Agreement a major step forward.\n[1]\n\u00b7\nThe Mine Development and Closure Plan (MDCP) and the associated environmental assessments have commenced with Resource WA.\nNaheed Memon, CEO of Oracle, commented\n:\n\"It is great to follow on from previous announcements and continue to expand and intersect gold grades in the northeast area and expand the saddle area. We believe these results are very impressive and add significant upside to the project for our plans with our partners for gold production targeted for later this year. Our modelling suggests that this could constitute part of a ~600m wide zone of shallow oxide mineralisation overlying the Northern Zone porphyry system.\n\"Oracle also notes from Riversgold's news release on the ASX today that MEGA Resources has become a shareholder of Riversgold, and we see this as highly promising for the JV partnership going forward.\n\"We are still awaiting results from 16 drillholes, expected in the coming weeks, and we are looking forward to the assays that will be from the northeast and saddle areas.\n\"The two recently completed drill programmes were designed to add to our gold footprint in the top 50-60m at our Kalgoorlie Gold Project, and to enhance the MEGA Resources mining scenario for 2026\n[2]\n. Results continue to expand the lateral footprint of Northern Zone and we are achieving the goal of making the project bigger in the oxide zone. I look forward to updating shareholders as we progress the project.\"\nThe latest drill programme results (\nTables 1-3\n) continue to successfully intersect the mineralised host porphyry over an increasing footprint and consistently validate the broader gold mineralisation model. Gold mineralisation has been successfully intersected in the northeast area, with a section of drill holes to the north of an existing single line, expanding the gold mineralisation footprint (\nFigure 2\n). More drill results from the saddle area between the west and east zones is filling in nicely, with a further 12 holes due shortly. A key SW-NE cross-section derived from 3D Leapfrog software is illustrated in\nFigure 3.\nThe interpretation illustrates gold grade shells derived from all the significant intercepts reported by Riversgold to April 2025. The Leapfrog model will be updated once all pending assays are received.\nNorthern Zone is hosted within a porphyry unit (Tonalite- Trondhjemite Intrusion, TTI), with high background gold and horizontal gold mineralised units within the TTI unit. The Northern Zone Project sits within the Canon Shear or fault zone, with further drilling required to define the limits of mineralisation identified to date. The horizontal mineralisation makes drilling to date perpendicular to the gold mineralisation, and no water in drilling to a depth of 60 metres makes the TTI also suitable for drilling with the techniques the Company has utilised to date.\nRiversgold will continue advancing its understanding of the Kalgoorlie Project before proceeding with a maiden Mineral Resource Estimate (\nMRE\n), but this drilling will be used by Mega Resources in their mine planning for our joint plans to start mining in the first half of 2026.\nFor further information on Oracle, visit the Company\n'\ns website at\nhttp://www.oraclepower.co.uk\nor contact\n:\nOracle Power PLC\nNaheed Memon - CEO +44 (0) 203 580 4314\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser & Broker)\nRory Murphy, Matthew Chandler, Rob Patrick +44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nSt Brides Partners Limited (Financial PR)\nSusie Geliher, Will Turner +44 (0) 20 7236 1177\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of EU Regulation No. 596/2014, which forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended by virtue of the Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019.\nCompetent Person\n'\ns Statement\nThe information in this announcement that relates to exploration results, exploration targets, mineral resources or ore reserves is based on information compiled by Mr Edward Mead, who is a Fellow of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy.

2: JORC INFORMATION\nThe following Tables are provided to ensure compliance with the JORC Code (2012 Edition) requirements for the reporting of Exploration Results at Northern Zone.\nSection 1: Sampling Techniques and Data\n(Criteria in this section applies to all succeeding sections)\nCriteria\nJORC Code explanation\nCommentary\nSampling techniques\nNature and quality of sampling (eg cut channels, random chips, or specific specialised industry standard measurement tools appropriate to the minerals under investigation, such as down hole gamma sondes, or handheld XRF instruments, etc). These examples should not be taken as limiting the broad meaning of sampling.\nInclude reference to measures taken to ensure sample representivity and the appropriate calibration of any measurement tools or systems used.\nAspects of the determination of mineralisation that are Material to the Public Report.\nIn cases where 'industry standard' work has been done this would be relatively simple (eg 'reverse circulation drilling was used to obtain 1 m samples from which 3 kg was pulverised to produce a 30 g charge for fire assay'). In other cases, more explanation may be required, such as where there is coarse gold that has inherent sampling problems. Unusual commodities or mineralisation types (eg submarine nodules) may warrant disclosure of detailed information.\nEvery metre drilled was placed on the ground.\n6m composites were collected using a scoop method of sampling the coarse reject sample for the first 24m.\n1m sampling using a rifle splitter was trialed on the clays, from 24m, with sampling deemed to create a high degree risk of smearing. The clays are not wet, but have a damp characteristic. A large metal scoop was used to sample between 70-90% of material from each metre drilled, to total between 2-3kg samples.\nStandard reference material, sample duplicates and blanks, were undertaken at 25m sample intervals.\nSamples were sent to the laboratory for crushing, splitting and analysis.\nAnalysis was undertaken by Jinnings laboratories (Kalgoorlie) for gold assay by 50g fire assay.\nDrilling techniques\nDrill type (eg core, reverse circulation, open-hole hammer, rotary air blast, auger, Bangka, sonic, etc) and details (eg core diameter, triple or standard tube, depth of diamond tails, face-sampling bit or other type, whether core is oriented and if so, by what method, etc).\nAustralian Surface Drilling completed the program using a face sampling hammer on an Atlas Copco grade control rig.\nDrill sample recovery\nMethod of recording and assessing core and chip sample recoveries and results assessed.\nMeasures taken to maximise sample recovery and ensure representative nature of the samples.\nWhether a relationship exists between sample recovery and grade and whether sample bias may have occurred due to preferential loss/gain of fine/coarse material.\nDrill recovery was routinely recorded via estimation of the comparative percentage of the volume of the sample bag by the company geologist.\nThe sample recovery was deemed excellent for representative assays.\nThe cyclone was cleaned or checked every 6m.\nLogging\nWhether core and chip samples have been geologically and geotechnically logged to a level of detail to support appropriate Mineral Resource estimation, mining studies and metallurgical studies.\nWhether logging is qualitative or quantitative in nature. Core (or costean, channel, etc) photography.\nThe total length and percentage of the relevant intersections logged.\nAll holes have been geologically logged for lithology, mineralisation and weathering. As well as whether dry, damp or wet.\nLogging is quantitative for presence of quartz veins. All other logging is qualitative.\nA brief description of each drilling sample was recorded and a permanent record has been collected and stored in chip trays for reference.\nSub-sampling techniques and sample preparation\nIf core, whether cut or sawn and whether quarter, half or all core taken.\nIf non-core, whether riffled, tube sampled, rotary split, etc and whether sampled wet or dry.\nFor all sample types, the nature, quality and appropriateness of the sample preparation technique.\nQuality control procedures adopted for all sub-sampling stages to maximise representivity of samples.\nMeasures taken to ensure that the sampling is representative of the in-situ material collected, including for instance results for field duplicate/second-half sampling.\nWhether sample sizes are appropriate to the grain size of the material being sampled.\n1m sampling using a rifle splitter was trialed on the clays, from 24m, with sampling deemed to create a high degree risk of smearing. The clays are not wet, but have a damp characteristic. A large metal scoop was used to sample between 70-90% of material from each metre drilled, to total between 2-3kg samples.\nStandard reference material, sample duplicates and blanks, were undertaken at 25m sample intervals.\nSamples were sent to the laboratory for crushing, splitting and analysis.\nThe use of fire assay with 50g charge for all AC drilling provides a level of confidence in the assay database. The sampling and assaying are considered representative of the in-situ material.\nThe sample size of 2-3 kilograms is appropriate and representative of the grain size and mineralisation style of the deposit.\nQuality of assay data and laboratory tests\nThe nature, quality and appropriateness of the assaying and laboratory procedures used and whether the technique is considered partial or total.\nFor geophysical tools, spectrometers, handheld XRF instruments, etc, the parameters used in determining the analysis including instrument make and model, reading times, calibrations factors applied and their derivation, etc.\nNature of quality control procedures adopted (eg standards, blanks, duplicates, external laboratory checks) and whether acceptable levels of accuracy (ie lack of bias) and precision have been established.\nJinnings (Kalgoorlie) were used for all analysis of drill samples submitted by Riversgold. The laboratory techniques below are for all samples submitted to Jinnings and are considered appropriate for the style of mineralisation defined within the Northern Zone Project area:\nSamples above 3Kg were riffle split.\nPulverise to 95% passing 75 microns\n50-gram Fire Assay (FA50A) - Au Duplicates, Standards and Blanks were used for external laboratory checks by RGL\nVerification of sampling and assaying\nThe verification of significant intersections by either independent or alternative company personnel.\nThe use of twinned holes.\nDocumentation of primary data, data entry procedures, data verification, data storage (physical and electronic) protocols.\nDiscuss any adjustment to assay data.\nIntercepts were reviewed by 2 company personnel.\nLocation of data points\nAccuracy and quality of surveys used to locate drill holes (collar and down-hole surveys), trenches, mine workings and other locations used in Mineral Resource estimation.\nSpecification of the grid system used.\nQuality and adequacy of topographic control.\nThe collar position of each hole has been marked out with a Garmin Inreach Explorer+ hand held GPS, and will be picked up by Spectrum Surveys (Kalgoorlie) using a DGPS.\nData spacing and distribution\nData spacing for reporting of Exploration Results.\nWhether the data spacing and distribution is sufficient to establish the degree of geological and grade continuity appropriate for the Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimation procedure(s) and classifications applied.\nWhether sample compositing has been applied.\nThe holes were drilled on a nominal Northeast-Southwest 20m spacing on traverses 15-20m apart.\nOrientation of data in relation to geological structure\nWhether the orientation of sampling achieves unbiased sampling of possible structures and the extent to which this is known, considering the deposit type.\nIf the relationship between the drilling orientation and the orientation of key mineralised structures is considered to have introduced a sampling bias, this should be assessed and reported if material.\nBased on logging of diamond core the drill holes appear to be orientated perpendicular to strike and dip of the main mineralised structures.\nAn interpreted fault though the middle of the mineralisation may have caused some displacement.\nSample security\nThe measures taken to ensure sample security.\nCompany personnel delivered samples to Jinnings Kalgoorlie where they were submitted for assay.\nAudits or reviews\nThe results of any audits or reviews of sampling techniques and data.\nData reviews will be conducted on completion of further drilling\nSection 2: Reporting of Exploration Results\n(Criteria listed in the preceding section also apply to this section)\nCriteria\nJORC Code explanation\nCommentary\nMineral tenement and land tenure status\nType, reference name/number, location and ownership including agreements or material issues with third parties such as joint ventures, partnerships, overriding royalties, native title interests, historical sites, wilderness or national park and environmental settings.\nThe security of the tenure held at the time of reporting along with any known impediments to obtaining a licence to operate in the area.\nThe Northern Zone Project is comprised of one granted prospecting licence (P25/2651) which covers an area of 82 hectares, and is held in the name of Riversgold (Australia) Pty Ltd 80/100, Oracle Gold (WA) Pty Ltd 20/100.\nThe JV documents are to be formalised by December 2025. Oracle will be required to contribute pro-rata or dilute.\nExploration done by other parties\nAcknowledgment and appraisal of exploration by other parties.\nThe majority of previous exploration in the area was by Northern Mining during 2007 to 2012 under the Blair North project, multiple small resource areas were identified at the George's Reward area to the south of P25/2651. Numerous gold intersections were recorded.\nGeology\nDeposit type, geological setting and style of mineralisation.\nThe deposit sought is (Intrusion Related Gold System (IRGS) style of mineral deposit.\nNorthern Zone is hosted within a porphyry unit (Tonalite- Trondhjemite Intrusion, TTI), with high background gold and horizontal gold mineralised units within the TTI unit. The Northern Zone Project sits within the Canon Shear or fault zone, with further drilling required to define the limits of mineralisation identified to date.\nDrill hole Information\nA summary of all information material to the understanding of the exploration results including a tabulation of the following information for all Material drill holes:\neasting and northing of the drill hole collar\nelevation or RL (Reduced Level - elevation above sea level in metres) of the drill hole collar\ndip and azimuth of the hole\ndown hole length and interception depth\nhole length.\nIf the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis that the information is not Material and this exclusion does not detract from the understanding of the report, the Competent Person should clearly explain why this is the case.\nRefer to Tables and Figures within the body of the release.\nData aggregation methods\nIn reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques, maximum and/or minimum grade truncations (eg cutting of high grades) and cut-off grades are usually Material and should be stated.\nWhere aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high-grade results and longer lengths of low-grade results, the procedure used for such aggregation should be stated and some typical examples of such aggregations should be shown in detail.\nThe assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent values should be clearly stated.\nIntersections are weighted average grades based on a 0.001 g/t Au cut-off with unlimited waste zones but with a targeted grade of 0.4-0.6g/t Au.\nRelationship between mineralisation widths and intercept lengths\nThese relationships are particularly important in the reporting of Exploration Results.\nIf the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill hole angle is known, its nature should be reported.\nIf it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported, there should be a clear statement to this effect (eg 'down hole length, true width not known').\nThe diamond drilling program in 2023 confirmed the apparent widths of mineralisation as being perpendicular to foliation and veining. Step out RC drilling to be the same as the diamond drilling. Mineralisation has been determined from structural logging to be horizontal and vertical drilling is therefore true width drilling.\nDiagrams\nAppropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of intercepts should be included for any significant discovery being reported These should include, but not be limited to a plan view of drill hole collar locations and appropriate sectional views.\nSee body of the announcement for relevant diagrams and photos.\nBalanced reporting\nWhere comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not practicable, representative reporting of both low and high grades and/or widths should be practiced to avoid misleading reporting of Exploration Results.\nThe reporting of exploration results is considered balanced by the competent person.\nOther substantive exploration data\nOther exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be reported including (but not limited to): geological observations; geophysical survey results; geochemical survey results; bulk samples - size and method of treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk density, groundwater, geotechnical and rock characteristics; potential deleterious or contaminating substances.\nSee body of the announcement.\nFurther work\nThe nature and scale of planned further work (eg tests for lateral extensions or depth extensions or large-scale step-out drilling).\nDiagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible extensions, including the main geological interpretations and future drilling areas, provided this information is not commercially sensitive.\n\u00b7\nFollow up phases of drilling to further test strike to be undertaken.\n\u00b7\nComplete a maiden MRE\n[1]\nAnnouncement dated 23 December 2025 - \" Kalgoorlie Gold Project Native Title Agreements Signed\"\n[2]\nAnnouncement dated 30 September 2025 - \" Riversgold Signs Mining and Co-Operation Agreement for Northern Zone Gold Project Near Kalgoorlie\"\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

These agreements relate to tenements M25/389 and P25/2848 that cover the ground over the Company's Kalgoorlie Gold Project.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nImportant milestone achieved for the granting of a mining lease.\n\u00b7\nThe executed key agreements with the Marlinyu Ghoorlie Native Title Claimant Group cover the Northern Zone Gold Project (\"Northern Zone\"), and any surrounding project areas.\n\u00b7\nThe agreements set out protocols for heritage surveys, safeguards for site protection, and streamlined grant of mining lease tenure and clearance procedures for activities under Oracle and Riversgold's tenure.\n\u00b7\nOracle and Riversgold have signed a Right to Mine and Co-Operation Agreement with MEGA\nResources (MEGA).\n\u00b7\nMEGA will provide all development and mining funding for Northern Zone on a 50/50 profit share\nNaheed Memon, CEO of Oracle, commented\n:\n\"We are very pleased to have signed this very important set of agreements with the Marlinyu Ghoorlie. These landmark agreements reflect the Northern Zone Gold Project's owners' commitment to working in partnership with the Marlinyu Ghoorlie people in a spirit of goodwill and mutual respect. This is a major milestone towards the advancement of the project and a key part of what is needed to convert the tenements to a Mining Lease and our moves to open up Northern Zone to gold production in 2026 with MEGA.\"\nThese agreements provide a solid framework of cooperatively working together to identify and protect Aboriginal Cultural Heritage on the Northern Zone whilst allowing the Company to advance towards gold production with Mega in 2026.\nAbout the MEGA Resources Right to Mine and Co-Operation Agreement for gold production at Northern Zone:\nOn the 30 September 2025, Oracle announced that it had signed a binding Right to Mine and Co-Operation Agreement with MEGA Resources (MEGA) for the right to mine (the MEGA Agreement) with respect to its 20% owned Northern Zone Gold Project.\nUnder the MEGA Agreement, MEGA will pay 100% of the costs to develop and mine at Northern Zone, including paying for all ancillary activities (which incorporates haulage of material to the point of sale, maintenance of haul roads and processing costs).\nIn return for MEGA paying for all the upfront costs at Northern Zone, any profit generated from this partnership will be split 50% to MEGA and 50% to the Project Owners.\nIn May 2023, Oracle signed a farm-in agreement with Riversgold. Riversgold advised Oracle that it had exercised its option to own the 80% interest in the Northern Zone tenement in February 2025. Northern Zone is now owned by Riversgold 80% and Oracle 20%, and this did not change with the MEGA Agreement.\nFor further information on Oracle, visit the Company\n'\ns website at\nhttp://www.oraclepower.co.uk\nor contact\n:\nOracle Power PLC\nNaheed Memon - CEO +44 (0) 203 580 4314\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser & Broker)\nRory Murphy, Matthew Chandler, Rob Patrick +44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nSt Brides Partners Limited (Financial PR)\nSusie Geliher, Ana Ribeiro +44 (0) 20 7236 1177\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of EU Regulation No. 596/2014, which forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended by virtue of the Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019.\nFigure\n1\n:\nLocation of Northern Zone Gold Project in relation to the Kalgoorlie Golden Mile/Fimiston \"Super Pit\".\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

Results from a further nine grade control drillholes are anticipated to be received shortly. Samples from 28 air core drillholes from the recently completed program have been submitted for assay, with results from all 37 drillholes expected to be received in batches over the next six weeks.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nRiversgold continues to keep intersecting shallow gold mineralisation at Northern Zone Project\n\u00b7\nAssay results from a further 6 drillholes have been received.\n\u00b7\nGold mineralisation now identified in the previously undrilled \"saddle\" between the eastern and northwestern mineralised zones.\n\u00b7\nSignificant results from the second batch of results include:\no\n5m at 3.09 g/t Au from 47m (NZAC152)\no\n6m at 0.72 g/t Au from 66m (end-of-hole) (NZAC152)\no\n6m at 0.65 g/t Au from 32m (NZAC153)\no\n1m at 11.0 g/t Au from 46m (NZAC153)\no\n8m at 0.62 g/t Au from 32m (NZAC154)\no\n2m at 1.47 g/t Au from 49m (NZAC155)\no\n7m at 1.58 g/t Au from 42m (NZAC156)\no\n2m at 1.32 g/t Au from 44m (NZAC157)\n\u00b7\n2025 drilling has now concluded with results from a further 37 drillholes due to be received in batches over the coming weeks.\nNaheed Memon, CEO of Oracle, commented\n:\n\"Intersecting these gold grades in the previously undrilled saddle area between the eastern and the northwestern shallow gold zones is highly significant as it demonstrates the potential for these two zones to join together. Our modelling suggests that this could constitute a ~600m wide zone of shallow oxide mineralisation overlying the Northern Zone porphyry system.\n\"We are still awaiting results from 9 drillholes from the grade control drill rig program, and 28 vertical air core drillholes from the drilling have just been submitted to the lab. With results from these 37 drillholes expected in the coming weeks, we are looking forward to a constant stream of news-flow leading into the New Year.\n\"The two recently completed drill programs were designed to add to the gold footprint in the top 50-60m at the Northern Zone Project, and to enhance the MEGA Resources mining scenario for 2026\n[1]\n. Results continue to expand the lateral footprint of Northern Zone and we are achieving the goal of making the Project bigger in the oxide zone. I look forward to updating shareholders as we progress the Project.\"\nThe latest drill programs (\nTables 1-3\n) continue to successfully intersect the mineralised host porphyry over an increasing footprint and consistently validate the broader gold mineralisation model. Gold mineralisation has been successfully intersected in a previously undrilled area referred to as the saddle with modelling suggests the potential of joining the northwestern and eastern mineralisation. The last drillhole on the eastern extension intersected significant gold mineralisation (see\nFigure 2\n), with the overall footprint expanding. A key SW-NE cross-section derived from 3D Leapfrog software is illustrated in\nFigure 3.\nThe interpretation illustrates gold grade shells derived from all the significant intercepts reported to April 2025. The Leapfrog model will be updated once all pending assays are received.\nNorthern Zone is hosted within a porphyry unit (Tonalite-Trondhjemite Intrusion, TTI), with high background gold and horizontal gold mineralised units within the TTI unit. The Northern Zone Project sits within the Canon Shear or fault zone, with further drilling required to define the limits of mineralisation identified to date. The horizontal mineralisation makes drilling to date perpendicular to the gold mineralisation, and no water in drilling to a depth of 60 metres makes the TTI also suitable for drilling with the techniques the Company has utilised to date.\nRiversgold will continue advancing its understanding of the Project before proceeding with a maiden Mineral Resource Estimate (\nMRE\n), but this drilling will be used by Mega Resources in their mine planning for our joint plans to start mining in the first half of 2026.\n**END**\nFor further information on Oracle, visit the Company\n'\ns website at\nhttp://www.oraclepower.co.uk\nor contact\n:\nOracle Power PLC\nNaheed Memon - CEO +44 (0) 203 580 4314\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser & Broker)\nRory Murphy, Matthew Chandler, Rob Patrick +44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nSt Brides Partners Limited (Financial PR)\nSusie Geliher, Isabel de Salis +44 (0) 20 7236 1177\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of EU Regulation No. 596/2014, which forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended by virtue of the Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019.\nCompetent Person\n'\ns Statement\nThe information in this announcement that relates to exploration results, exploration targets, mineral resources or ore reserves is based on information compiled by Mr Edward Mead, who is a Fellow of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy.

Step out RC drilling to be the same as the diamond drilling. Mineralisation has been determined from structural logging to be horizontal and vertical drilling is therefore true width drilling.\nDiagrams\nAppropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of intercepts should be included for any significant discovery being reported These should include, but not be limited to a plan view of drill hole collar locations and appropriate sectional views\n.\nSee body of the announcement for relevant diagrams and photos.\nBalanced reporting\nWhere comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not practicable, representative reporting of both low and high grades and/or widths should be practiced to avoid misleading reporting of Exploration Results.\nThe reporting of exploration results i\ns considered balanced by the competent person.\nOther substantive exploration data\nOther exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be reported including (but not limited to): geological observations; geophysical survey results; geochemical survey results; bulk samples - size and method of treatment; metallurgical test results;\nbulk density, groundwater, geotechnical and rock characteristics; potential deleterious or contaminating substances.\nSee body of the announcement.\nFurther work\nThe nature and scale of planned further work (eg tests for lateral extensions or depth extensions or large-scale step-out drilling).\nDiagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible extensions, including the main geological interpretations and future dr\nilling areas, provided this information is not commercially sensitive.\n\u00b7\nFollow up phases of drilling to further test strike to be undertaken.\n\u00b7\nComplete a maiden MRE\n[1]\nAnnouncement dated 30 September 2025 - \" Northern Zone Gold Project Co-operation Agreement\"\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.

In addition, drilling is progressing on a new ~40-hole drilling\u00a0programme, with 12 holes completed to date.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nThe Company continues to expand the gold mineralisation footprint at the Northern Zone.\n\u00b7\nAssay results from the first six holes of a 21-hole programme have been received.\n\u00b7\nSignificant results from the first batch of results from pre-Christmas drilling include:\no\n9m @ 1.33 g/t Au from 56m, (NZAC146)\no\n3m @ 4.39 g/t Au from 45m, (NZAC149)\no\n3m @ 1.89 g/t Au from 48m, (NZAC150)\no\n5m @ 1.75 g/t Au from 61m (EOH), (NZAC150)\no\n4m @ 0.83 g/t Au from 47m,\n(NZAC151)\n\u00b7\nTargeted drilling continues, with the current campaign 12 holes into a further 40-hole programme with results to be reported in the next six to eight weeks.\nNaheed Memon, CEO of Oracle, commented\n:\n\"As highlighted before, we planned to undertake two drill programmes before the end of the year to add to our gold footprint in the top 50-60 metres at our Northern Zone gold project, and to enhance the MEGA Resources mining operations scenario for 2026. The results from this first batch of assay results continue to expand the lateral footprint of the Northern Zone and we continue to achieve the goal of making the project bigger in the oxide zone.\n\"Everything is going to plan as we expand the mineralised footprint of the Project and define the high-grade gold zone hosted within a large lower-grade porphyry host. The reported results continue to meet and exceed expectations, with the new high-grade zone being delineated on the eastern margin of the Project, now looking to move northwards.\n\"The second shallow drill programme is well underway with more samples now in for assay, and we expect to report these assay results over the next six to eight weeks.\"\nResults from the GC programme (Tables 1-3) continue to successfully intersect the mineralised host porphyry over an expanding footprint, consistently supporting the broader gold mineralisation model. Five drillholes on the eastern extension intersected significant gold mineralisation (see Figure 2), with the footprint expanding northwards. A key SW-NE cross-section derived from 3D Leapfrog software is illustrated in Figure 3\n.\nThe interpretation illustrates gold grade shells, derived from all the significant intercepts announced by the Company to April 2025. The Leapfrog model will be updated once all pending assays are received.\nNorthern Zone is hosted within a porphyry unit (Tonalite-Trondhjemite Intrusion, TTI), with high background gold and horizontal gold mineralised units within the TTI unit. The Northern Zone Project sits within the Canon Shear or fault zone, with further drilling required to define the limits of mineralisation identified to date. The horizontal mineralisation makes drilling to date perpendicular to the gold mineralisation, and no water in drilling to a depth of 60 metres makes the TTI also suitable for drilling with the techniques the Company has utilised to date.\nThe Northern Zone JV will continue advancing its understanding of the Kalgoorlie Project before proceeding with a maiden Mineral Resource Estimate (\nMRE\n), but this drilling will be used by Mega Resources in their mine planning for our joint plans to start mining in the first half of 2026.\n**ENDS**\nFor further information on Oracle, visit the Company\n'\ns website at\nhttp://www.oraclepower.co.uk\nor contact\n:\nOracle Power PLC\nNaheed Memon - CEO +44 (0) 203 580 4314\nStrand Hanson Limited (Nominated Adviser & Broker)\nRory Murphy, Matthew Chandler, Rob Patrick +44 (0) 20 7409 3494\nSt Brides Partners Limited (Financial PR)\nSusie Geliher, Isabel de Salis +44 (0) 20 7236 1177\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of EU Regulation No. 596/2014, which forms part of United Kingdom domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended by virtue of the Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019.\nCompetent Person\n'\ns Statement\nThe information in this announcement that relates to exploration results, exploration targets, mineral resources or ore reserves is based on information compiled by Mr Edward Mead, who is a Fellow of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy.

Oracle will be required to contribute pro-rata or dilute.\nExploration done by other parties\nAcknowledgment and appraisal of exploration by other parties.\nThe majority of previous exploration in the area was by Northern Mining during 2007 to 2012 under the Blair North project, multiple small resource areas were identified at the George's Reward area to the south of P25/2651. Numerous gold intersections were recorded.\nGeology\nDeposit type, geological setting and style of mineralisation.\nThe deposit sought is (Intrusion Related Gold System (IRGS) style of mineral deposit.\nNorthern Zone is hosted within a porphyry unit (Tonalite- Trondhjemite Intrusion, TTI), with high background gold and horizontal gold mineralised units within the TTI unit. The Northern Zone Project sits within the Canon Shear or fault zone, with further drilling required to define the limits of mineralisation identified to date.\nDrill hole Information\nA summary of all information material to the understanding of the exploration results including a tabulation of the following information for all Material drill holes:\neasting and northing of the drill hole collar\nelevation or RL (Reduced Level - elevation above sea level in metres) of the drill hole collar\ndip and azimuth of the hole\ndown hole length and interception depth\nhole length.\nIf the exclusion of this information is justified on the basis that the information is not Material and this exclusion does not detract from the understanding of the report, the Competent Person should clearly explain why this is the case.\nRefer to Tables and Figures within the body of the release.\nData aggregation methods\nIn reporting Exploration Results, weighting averaging techniques, maximum and/or minimum grade truncations (eg cutting of high grades) and cut-off grades are usually Material and should be stated.\nWhere aggregate intercepts incorporate short lengths of high-grade results and longer lengths of low-grade results, the procedure used for such aggregation should be stated and some typical examples of such aggregations should be shown in detail.\nThe assumptions used for any reporting of metal equivalent values should be clearly stated.\nIntersections are weighted average grades based on a 0.001 g/t Au cut-off with unlimited waste zones but with a targeted grade of 0.4-0.6g/t Au.\nRelationship between mineralisation widths and intercept lengths\nThese relationships are particularly important in the reporting of Exploration Results.\nIf the geometry of the mineralisation with respect to the drill hole angle is known, its nature should be reported.\nIf it is not known and only the down hole lengths are reported, there should be a clear statement to this effect (eg 'down hole length, true width not known').\nThe diamond drilling program in 2023 confirmed the apparent widths of mineralisation as being perpendicular to foliation and veining. Step out RC drilling to be the same as the diamond drilling. Mineralisation has been determined from structural logging to be horizontal and vertical drilling is therefore true width drilling.\nDiagrams\nAppropriate maps and sections (with scales) and tabulations of intercepts should be included for any significant discovery being reported These should include, but not be limited to a plan view of drill hole collar locations and appropriate sectional views.\nSee body of the announcement for relevant diagrams and photos.\nBalanced reporting\nWhere comprehensive reporting of all Exploration Results is not practicable, representative reporting of both low and high grades and/or widths should be practiced to avoid misleading reporting of Exploration Results.\nThe reporting of exploration results is considered balanced by the competent person.\nOther substantive exploration data\nOther exploration data, if meaningful and material, should be reported including (but not limited to): geological observations; geophysical survey results; geochemical survey results; bulk samples - size and method of treatment; metallurgical test results; bulk density, groundwater, geotechnical and rock characteristics; potential deleterious or contaminating substances.\nSee body of the announcement.\nFurther work\nThe nature and scale of planned further work (eg tests for lateral extensions or depth extensions or large-scale step-out drilling).\nDiagrams clearly highlighting the areas of possible extensions, including the main geological interpretations and future drilling areas, provided this information is not commercially sensitive.\n\u00b7\nFollow up phases of drilling to further test strike to be undertaken.\n\u00b7\nComplete a maiden MRE\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
