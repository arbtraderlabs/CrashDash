      "The crash\u2011zone bottom score (8/21) combined with an 85.4% drawdown and an entry price of 0.00p suggests the stock may have been delisted or forced into a nominal price, yet the ticker remains on the AIM list."
    ],
    "hidden_patterns": [
      "The juxtaposition of a \u2018dead_ticker\u2019 label with upward Google momentum is a rare pattern that often precedes a short\u2011term price rebound driven by institutional speculation.",
      "Zero volatility metrics coupled with an 85% drawdown point to a possible \u2018price\u2011freeze\u2019 scenario where the shares are still listed but not trading, a situation that can trigger a sudden liquidity shock if the company is revived."
    ],
    "contrarian_signals": [

    "risk_warnings": [
      "No trading volume and zero ATR/StdDev mean the stock is illiquid; any price move could be extremely volatile and subject to manipulation.",
      "The 0.00p entry price indicates a potential delisting or regulatory suspension; if the company is not reinstated, the shares could become worthless.",
      "Absence of recent RNS or catalysts means there is no official source confirming the Google trend momentum; the spike could be a false flag or a one\u2011off data glitch."
    ],
    "opportunity_flags": [
      "A Google trend momentum of +333% in a dead ticker often precedes a takeover bid or a regulatory announcement; monitor for any press release or insider filings in the next 1\u20132 weeks.",
      "If the company is revived or a spin\u2011off is announced, the price could jump from the nominal 0.00p to a viable level; early entry before the official announcement would capture maximum upside."

The lack of RNS, social chatter, and zero volatility signals extreme illiquidity and a high risk of delisting, but the contrarian momentum suggests that an institutional play could emerge if a takeover or spin\u2011off materializes."
