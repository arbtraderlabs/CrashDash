(\"\nZenith\n\" or the \"Company\") (\nLSE: ZEN; OSE: ZENA; XSAT: ZENA SDR\n), the listed international energy production and development company, is pleased\u00a0to announce\u00a0that it has completed a private placement of common shares of no par value (\"\nCommon Shares\n\") with a long-term institutional investor in the United Kingdom (the \"\nUK Financing\n\") and a private placement in Norway with institutional investors (the \"\nNorwegian Financing\n\"). The Company has also issued broker shares (the \"\nBroker Shares\n\") (collectively, the \"\nFinancings\n\").\nThe Financings have included the participation of new and existing investors to raise an aggregate total amount of approximately \u00a33,658,500 (equivalent to approx. NOK 49,034,000), resulting in the issuance of a total of 100,892,105 new common shares (\"\nNew Common Shares\n\").\nNorwegian Financing\nZenith has issued a total of 84,157,162 Common Shares in connection with the Norwegian Financing (the \"\nNorwegian Financing Common Shares\n\") to raise gross proceeds of approximately NOK 41,525,000 (approximately \u00a33,096,000).\nAn application for the Norwegian Financing Common Shares to be listed on the Equity Shares (Transition) category of the Official List and to trading on the London Stock Exchange's main market for listed securities (the \"\nNorwegian Financing Admission\n\") will be made within 12 months of the issue of the Norwegian Financing Common Shares.\nUK Financing\nZenith has issued a total of 13,513,514 Common Shares in connection with the UK Financing (the \"\nUK Financing Common Shares\n\") to raise gross proceeds of approximately \u00a3450,000 (approximately NOK 6,000,000).\nIt is expected that the UK Financing Admission will become effective and that unconditional dealings in the UK Financing Common Shares will commence on or around 8.00 a.m. (GMT) on or around December 16, 2025.\nIssue\u00a0Price\nThe Norwegian Financing was completed at a price of\nNOK 0.4662\nper New Norwegian Financing Common Share, representing a 10% discount in respect of\u00a0the closing price of the Company's equity securities on the Euronext Growth Oslo on December 5, 2025.\nThe UK Financing was completed at a price of\n\u00a30.0333\nper UK Financing Common Share, representing a 10% discount in respect of the closing Bid price of the Company's equity securities admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange on December 5, 2025.\nUse of Proceeds\nThe proceeds of the Financings will be utilised to progress the Company's two applications for exploration permits (\nPermessi di Ricerca\n) in respect of Italy's two largest identified uranium deposits, as announced on 11 November 2025. These deposits are situated in the Lombardy region and comprise the Val Vedello deposit in the Province of Sondrio (\"\nVal Vedello\n\") and the Novazza deposit in the Province of Bergamo (\"\nNovazza\n\").\nProceeds will also be applied towards the construction of the Company's initial solar production assets in the Puglia region of Italy and to meet additional legal fees arising from the expansion of the Company's legal team in respect of its ongoing ICSID Arbitration against the Republic of Tunisia, as announced on 3 December 2025.\nProceeds will also be used for general working capital purposes.\nBroker Shares\nThe Company has allotted 3,221,429 new Common Shares (\"\nBroker Shares\n\"), in lieu of cash settlement for services provided to Zenith in connection with the Financings for a total value of 1,502,000 NOK (equivalent to approx. \u00a3112,500).\nThe Broker Shares will rank pari passu in all respects with the existing common shares of the Company.\nAn application for the Broker Shares to be listed on the standard segment of the FCA Official List and to be admitted for trading on the London Stock Exchange Main Market for listed securities will be made within 12 months of the issue of the Broker Shares.\nTotal Voting Rights\nThe Company announces the following information, in accordance with the Financial Conduct Authority's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules and section 3.10 and 3.11.5 (3) of the Euronext Growth Oslo Rule Book Part II, resulting from the issuance of the New Common Shares.\nClass of share\nTotal number of shares\nNumber of voting rights per share\nTotal number of voting rights per class of share\nCommon Shares in issue and admitted to trading on the Main Market of the\u00a0London Stock Exchange\n561,803,736\n1\n561,803,736\nCommon Shares in issue and admitted to trading on the Euronext Growth Market of the Oslo B\u00f8rs and Spotlight Market Stockholm\n649,182,327\n1\n649,182,327\nAndrea Cattaneo, Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"\nWe are pleased to have secured institutional investment at this key stage in our development. The first six months of 2026 will be characterised by potentially transformational activity for our business with the submission of two separate environmental impact assessments for the two largest Uranium deposits in Italy, the commencement of construction of our first solar plant in the Puglia region of Italy, and the final hearing of the ICSID arbitration in late April for a total claimed amount exceeding approximately US$572.65\nmillion.\nI am fully conscious of the painful dilution, and I am pleased to confirm that we do not anticipate conducting any further equity issuances for any of our existing activities until June 2026 at the very earliest following the Financings.\nThe Board sees significant scope for our market valuation to return to prior levels following the value catalysts that lie before us, following the shock represented by the entirely unexpected and flawed verdict of the ICC-2 arbitration.\n\"\nFurther Information\n:\nZenith Energy Ltd\nAndrea Cattaneo, Chief Executive Officer\nTel: +1 (587) 315 1279\nE: info@zenithenergy.ca\nNotes to Editors:\nZenith Energy Ltd. is a revenue generating, independent energy company with energy production, exploration and development assets in North Africa, the US and Europe.

(\"\nZenith\n\" or the \"\nCompany\n\") (\nLSE\n:\nZEN\n;\nOSE\n:\nZENA\n;\nXSAT\n:\nZENA\nSDR\n), the listed international energy production and development company,\u00a0is pleased to\nannounce that it has received the results of an independent valuation of its existing solar energy development pipeline (the \"\nDevelopment Pipeline\n\").\nThe independent valuation has been conducted by a prominent Italian consultancy firm with recognised expertise in the renewable energy and solar industries. As it is based on specific assumptions and information, the valuation remains subject to the inherent risks and uncertainties typical of renewable energy project development.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nTotal Development Pipeline capacity\n: 110.5 MWp.\n\u00b7\nIndependent valuation of the Development Pipeline:\n\u20ac27,500,000.00 (approximately US$32 million / NOK 322 million / SEK 300 million).\nZenith has previously informed the market of its intention to sell a 50% interest in the portfolio once projects reach Ready-to-Build\n(\"RTB\")\nstatus. Based on the independent valuation, the implied value of a 50% interest is\n\u20ac13.75 million\n.\nThe Development Pipeline comprises a continuous stream of projects progressing through key development milestones, including:\n\u00b7\nSecuring control of project sites.\n\u00b7\nPermitting and authorisations for the installation of Photovoltaic panels and associated equipment.\n\u00b7\nSecuring connection to the power grid.\nRTB is the stage at which the principal permits, authorisations and grid connection requirements are in place, enabling construction to commence. Following RTB, projects progress through construction and commissioning, with commercial revenues generated once projects are connected and operational.\nAndrea Cattaneo, Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"\nZenith is an industrial company with a strong track record of bringing energy assets into production. We began producing oil in July 2010, natural gas in June 2013, and electricity in July 2014.\nFollowing the asset seizures carried out by the Republic of Tunisia, we made the strategic decision to broaden our industrial base by focusing on Europe and expanding into the development and construction of solar parks. As part of this strategy, we have grown our solar development pipeline from an initial target of 20 MWp to 110.5 MWp.\nThe independent valuation we have received supports this strategic direction and confirms the potential attractiveness of the 50% interest we plan to offer for sale once the projects reach RTB status. We believe this provides shareholders with additional reassurance regarding the value-creation potential of our renewable energy development activities\n.\"\nFurther Information\n:\nZenith Energy Ltd\nAndrea Cattaneo, Chief Executive Officer\nTel: +1 (587) 315 1279\nE: info@zenithenergy.ca\nNotes to Editors:\nZenith Energy Ltd. is a revenue generating, independent energy company with energy production, exploration and development assets in North Africa, the US and Europe.\nZenith Energy is listed on the London Stock Exchange Main Market (LSE:ZEN), has its entire common share capital admitted to trading on the Euronext Growth of the Oslo Stock Exchange (OSE:ZENA), and has Swedish Depository Receipts admitted to the Spotlight Stock Market in Sweden (XSAT: ZENA SDR).\nZenith's strategic focus is on pursuing development opportunities through the development of proven revenue generating energy production assets, as well as low-risk exploration activities in assets with existing production.\nFor more information, please visit: www.zenithenergy.ca\nTwitter: @zenithenergyltd\nLinkedIn:\nhttps://bit.ly/3A5PRJb\nMarket Abuse Regulation (MAR) Disclosure\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014 as it forms part of\u00a0UK\u00a0domestic law by virtue of the\u00a0European Union\u00a0(Withdrawal) Act 2018 (\"\nMAR\n\").

(\"\nZenith\n\" or the \"\nCompany\n\") (\nLSE\n:\nZEN\n;\nOSE\n:\nZENA\n;\nXSAT\n:\nZENA\nSDR\n), the listed international energy production and development company,\u00a0is delighted to announce the appointment of Ben Juratowitch KC and Matthieu Gregoire, both barristers at Essex Court Chambers, to further broaden and complement the legal team of its claimant subsidiaries in the arbitration proceedings brought before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"\nICSID\n\") under the UK-Tunisia Bilateral Investment Treaty, against the Republic of Tunisia, led by Professor Thomas Clay (Clay Arbitration) alongside Simon Le Wita (Charles Russell Speechlys Paris).\nBen Juratowitch KC\nBen Juratowitch KC is a specialist in public international law and international arbitration with more than two decades of experience acting for sovereign states, international organisations and multinational corporations. Before joining the Bar, he served as the global Head of Public International Law at Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer.

He holds a DPhil and BCL from the University of Oxford, where he was a Rhodes Scholar, and a University Medal for Law from the University of Queensland. His work has been recognised with awards including Silk of the Year for International Arbitration (Legal 500, 2023) and selection to Global Arbitration Review's \"45 under 45\".\nMatthieu Gregoire\nMatthieu Gregoire is an advocate specialising in commercial litigation, international commercial arbitration and investor-state arbitration. He advises and represents governments, corporations and individuals in disputes across sectors including energy, mining, manufacturing and financial services, often involving allegations of civil fraud and other cross-border misconduct.\nHe has appeared before all levels of the English courts and has extensive experience in investment treaty arbitration under ICSID, SCC, UNCITRAL and ad hoc rules, including matters arising under the OIC Investment Agreement and intra-EU bilateral investment treaties. His commercial arbitration practice spans ICC, LCIA, SCC and UNCITRAL rules and frequently involves issues of foreign law, jurisdiction and enforcement.

He was appointed to the Attorney General's Public International Law C Panel in 2017. He holds an LLM from Georgetown University, a Master's degree from Sciences Po and a BA in Law from the University of Cambridge.\nEssex Court Chambers\nEssex Court Chambers is a leading group of specialist barristers with deep experience in international arbitration and public international law-expertise directly relevant to the ICSID arbitration brought by the Company's UK subsidiaries under the UK-Tunisia Bilateral Investment Treaty. Its members regularly act in significant investor-state disputes under the ICSID Convention and other major arbitral frameworks, and frequently appear before the English courts in matters concerning arbitration, enforcement and interim measures.\nAndrea Cattaneo, Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"The legal team, led by Professor Thomas Clay and comprised of Ma\u00eetre Simon Le Wita of Charles Russell Speechlys Paris, is already exceptionally strong and has thoroughly and robustly presented the merits of the position in progressing the ICSID arbitration brought by the Company's UK subsidiaries under the UK-Tunisia Bilateral Investment Treaty. The Company is very pleased to further complement and broaden the skillset and expertise of this team with the addition of Ben Juratowitch KC and Matthieu Gregoire. Ben brings extensive experience in public international law and investor-state arbitration, including acting in proceedings before the International Court of Justice and multiple ICSID tribunals. Matthieu adds significant expertise in commercial and investment treaty arbitration, including disputes involving states and cross-border allegations of misconduct. Their combined experience is directly relevant to the issues at the centre of the UK-Tunisia 1989 Bilateral Investment Treaty, and their arrival adds further depth to the representation at a seminal juncture in the ICSID arbitration against the Republic of Tunisia.\nWe look forward to the final hearings in April 2026 with well-grounded optimism and a sincere belief in redress and compensation for the prolonged damages suffered by\nthe Company's UK\nsubsidiary claimants\n, which have been significantly impaired as a result of arbitrary and unlawful conduct that has resulted in the sequestration and expropriatory termination of their activities and assets. All members of the legal team share a clear and unshakable assessment of the strength of the position, supported by the extensive preparation undertaken to date. The Company remains firmly focused on securing redress for the significant damage\nits UK subsidiary claimants\nhave suffered in Tunisia, and which, as recent events demonstrate,\nthe\nUK subsidiary claimants\ncontinue to suffer because of arbitrary and unlawful conduct by the authorities in the Republic of Tunisia. The next five months will have a transformational impact on the Zenith Group, and every possible action will be taken to defend the rights of\nthe Company's UK subsidiary claimants\nand vindicate the merits of their position.\"\nFurther Information\n:\nZenith Energy Ltd\nAndrea Cattaneo, Chief Executive Officer\nTel: +1 (587) 315 1279\nE: info@zenithenergy.ca\nNotes to Editors:\nZenith Energy Ltd. is a revenue generating, independent energy company with energy production, exploration and development assets in North Africa, the US and Europe.\nZenith Energy is listed on the London Stock Exchange Main Market (LSE:ZEN), has its entire common share capital admitted to trading on the Euronext Growth of the Oslo Stock Exchange (OSE:ZENA), and has Swedish Depository Receipts admitted to the Spotlight Stock Market in Sweden (XSAT: ZENA SDR).\nZenith's strategic focus is on pursuing development opportunities through the development of proven revenue generating energy production assets, as well as low-risk exploration activities in assets with existing production.\nFor more information, please visit: www.zenithenergy.ca\nTwitter: @zenithenergyltd\nLinkedIn:\nhttps://bit.ly/3A5PRJb\nMarket Abuse Regulation (MAR) Disclosure\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014 as it forms part of\u00a0UK\u00a0domestic law by virtue of the\u00a0European Union\u00a0(Withdrawal) Act 2018 (\"\nMAR\n\").

(\"\nZenith\n\" or the \"\nCompany\n\") (\nLSE: ZEN; OSE: ZENA; XSAT: ZENA SDR\n), the listed international energy production and development company, provides an update regarding its Tunisian portfolio comprised of the oil production concessions of Robbana and El Bibane (the \"\nConcessions\n\") both held with a 100% interest by the Company's fully owned subsidiary, Ecumed Petroleum Tunisia Ltd (\"\nEPT\n\").\nUpdate on Robbana and El Bibane\nSince 2022, the Tunisian authorities have repeatedly obstructed and delayed the sale of oil from the Concessions,\u00a0impeding the continuation of production through the deliberate obstruction of oil sales, preventing EPT from generating revenue and operating as a functioning business.\nAs a result, EPT has been required to fund all salaries, environmental compliance, and technical upkeep of the assets, incurring total costs of approximately\u00a0US$2 million\u00a0to date.\nOil Production and Storage\nTotal oil production since 2022 amounts to\u00a011,670 barrels of oil, as follows:\n\u00b7\n2022:\u00a05,791 barrels\n\u00b7\n2023:\u00a04,408 barrels\n\u00b7\n2024:\u00a01,471 barrels\nProduction would have been materially higher, and would have not progressively declined, had EPT been permitted to sell its oil and receive payment regularly.\nApproximately\u00a08,000 barrels\u00a0are currently stored at Robbana, representing full storage capacity.\nA further\u00a03,987 barrels\u00a0were transferred to storage at\u00a0MARETAP\u00a0after EPT was\u00a0forcibly ordered by the Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy\u00a0to empty its tanks at the\u00a0El Bibane concession\u00a0in January 2024 for alleged safety reasons. EPT was\u00a0denied the possibility to sell its oil\u00a0and was instead ordered to move its stock of crude oil to MARETAP.\nThe emptying of the storage tanks was completed on\u00a0April 20, 2024. This occurred\u00a0despite a safety inspection conducted on April 1, 2024, which confirmed that the entire El Bibane oil storage infrastructure\u00a0presented no environmental or safety risks.\nUpdate Regarding MARETAP\nThe Company holds a\u00a050% interest\u00a0in\u00a0MARETAP, the joint venture operating company of the now arbitrarily terminated Ezzaouia concession, through its subsidiary\u00a0Ecumed Petroleum Zarzis Ltd.\u00a0(\"\nEPZ\n\"), co-owned alongside Entreprise Tunisienne d'Activit\u00e9s P\u00e9troli\u00e8res (\"\nETAP\n\"), the national oil company of Tunisia.\nMARETAP's management continues to breach fundamental corporate governance obligations by\u00a0denying EPZ access to financial, operational, and corporate information\u00a0to which it is legally entitled as a 50% shareholder. This ongoing refusal represents a clear and serious violation of EPZ's shareholder rights.\nUnauthorised Sale of 3,987 Barrels of EPT Oil\nThe Company has been informed that\u00a0ETAP has\u00a0sold the 3,987 barrels of oil produced by EPT and transferred to MARETAP,\u00a0without any authorisation or notification\u00a0to EPT. ETAP has further indicated that\u00a0no proceeds from this sale will be paid\u00a0to EPT.\nThis sale constitutes a further confiscation and expropriation suffered by subsidiaries of Zenith committed by the Tunisian authorities.\nThis new act of confiscation is particularly serious and evidently premeditated, having been facilitated by the order imposed on EPT last year by the Tunisian authorities to empty its storage tanks\u00a0without any valid justification.\nEPT, together with all wholly owned subsidiaries of Zenith, is taking immediate steps to assert its rights to ensure that this latest unlawful action does not go unchallenged.\nEPT, its affiliated companies, and the relevant shareholders will continue to pursue\u00a0all legal remedies available\u00a0to them.\nAndrea Cattaneo, Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"\nIt is extraordinary that the Tunisian authorities have persisted along a now clearly established path of arbitrary conduct, unlawful expropriation, and systematic breaches of contractual and legal obligations - all while an international arbitration has been ongoing for almost four years. The latest unlawful sale of our oil represents yet another evident act of unlawful confiscation.\nThis behaviour continues to demonstrate the extraordinary arrogance of the Tunisian authorities and their apparent sense of impunity. Sadly, it does not surprise us. Over the past three years, we have witnessed a pattern of conduct that has caused material harm not only to our subsidiary companies but also to our Tunisian employees and the local communities, all of whom have suffered because certain state institutions operate with no respect whatsoever for the rule of law.\nIt is equally clear that the Tunisian authorities believed that by withholding payment for our oil - while imposing on us all the costs and obligations associated with maintaining the assets - they would weaken our financial capacity to pursue justice through international arbitration. Their intention was transparent: to exhaust us into abandoning our rights. However, this strategy has failed.\nOur determination to obtain justice has only strengthened, particularly following the deeply troubling ICC-2 decision in July. These developments have reinforced our belief that the Tunisian authorities will seek to avoid justice by any means available - evidenced, for example, by their continued failure to make any payment in respect of the ICC-1 decision issued in December 2024.\nThe way the El Bibane and Robbana concessions have been handled makes clear that they were effectively left to us solely to impose additional financial burdens and losses. At no point has there been any respect for the rule of law, the sanctity of contracts, or the protection of foreign investment in any of the actions taken by the Tunisian authorities.\"\nFurther Information\n:\nZenith Energy Ltd\nAndrea Cattaneo, Chief Executive Officer\nTel: +1 (587) 315 1279\nE: info@zenithenergy.ca\nNotes to Editors:\nZenith Energy Ltd. is a revenue generating, independent energy company with energy production, exploration and development assets in North Africa, the US and Europe.
