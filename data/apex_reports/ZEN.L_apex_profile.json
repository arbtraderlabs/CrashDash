(\n\"Zenith\"\nor the\n\"Company\"\n) (\nLSE: ZEN; OSE: ZENA; XSAT: ZENA SDR\n), the listed international energy production and development company, is pleased to announce the acquisition of an agrivoltaic project at development stage located in the Piedmont region of Italy (the\n\"Acquisition\"\n), through its wholly-owned Italian subsidiary, responsible for managing its solar energy portfolio, WESOLAR S.R.L. (\n\"WESOLAR\"\n).\nOverview of the Acquisition\n\u2022 The Acquisition comprises a photovoltaic solar energy production project located in the Piedmont region, with an expected installed capacity of approximately 10 MWp.\n\u2022 The Acquisition is classified as being in the development stage.\n\u2022 Piedmont, and particularly the Province of Alessandria, where the new plant will be developed, is one of the most industrialised areas in Italy. This characteristic makes the sale of electricity from renewable sources particularly profitable, due to strong local energy demand. Demand to acquire this type of project remains consistently high.\n\u2022 This additional acquisition in Piedmont enables Zenith to further consolidate its significant presence in the region, where approximately 60 MWp of projects are already under development, while at the same time complementing the Company's existing pipeline in Piedmont, Puglia and Lazio.\n\u2022 Italy stands out as one of the world's leading countries in the development and implementation of photovoltaic technology.\n\u2022 The Company expects the project to reach Ready-to-Build status within the next 12-15 months.\n\u2022 The consideration for the acquisition of the land for the new project amounts to EUR 768,215.00, conditional upon the achievement of all necessary permits to reach Ready-to-Build status.\nAdvanced negotiations are currently underway for the acquisition of two additional projects.\nStrategy Overview\nIn the solar energy industry, a \"pipeline\" refers to the aggregate portfolio of development projects being actively advanced toward construction day after day. Zenith's pipeline is composed of projects progressing daily through design, permitting, and grid-connection milestones, moving step by step toward Ready-to-Build (\n\"RtB\"\n) status. This expanding portfolio carries tangible market value, which typically increases as projects mature and de-risk through successive development stages.\nAs previously announced in the Company's regulatory news announcement dated December 4, 2025, Zenith received the results of an independent valuation of its existing solar energy development pipeline (the\n\"Pipeline\"\n). At that time, the pipeline totalled 110.5 MWp and was independently valued at \u20ac27,500,000.00.\nSince the independent valuation was completed, Zenith's solar portfolio has increased to 120.5 MWp as of February 2, 2026. Accordingly, the previously announced independent valuation does not reflect the additional capacity acquired since that date. The Company believes that the increase in portfolio capacity provides further support for the value-creation potential of its renewable energy development activities, although no updated independent valuation has been published for the enlarged portfolio.\nZenith intends to maintain a balanced approach across its Italian portfolio, progressing projects toward RtB status while selectively assessing opportunities to monetise portions of the development pipeline with professional counterparties, and to construct selected assets to establish tangible and recurring electricity production revenue.\nOverview of Zenith Energy's Solar Portfolio (as of February 2, 2026)\nProject / Stage\nCapacity (MWp)\nStatus\nNotes\nLiguria Solar Asset\n0.5\nProduction Upgrade\nCurrently producing 0.2 MWp, upgrade to 0.5 MWp planned.\nLazio Agrivoltaic Project 1\n10.0\nDevelopment\nFirst Lazio acquisition (10 MWp) announced Aug 6, 2025.\nLazio Agrivoltaic Project 2\n7.0\nDevelopment\nFirst announced on August 27, 2025, installed capacity has been increased to 7 MWp from 5 MWp.\nPiedmont Agrivoltaic Development Projects\n30.0\nDevelopment\nAcquisition comprising of various agrivoltaics projects announced on August 11, 2025.\nPiedmont PV Development Project\n10.0\nDevelopment\nOriginally an Agrivoltaic project, subsequently reclassified to conventional solar energy as announced on August 22, 2025.\nPiedmont Agrivoltaic Development Project\n18.0\nDevelopment\nAcquisition signed and announced on October 19, 2025.\nPiedmont Advanced Agrivoltaic Development Project\n10.0\nDevelopment\nAcquisition announced on February 2, 2026.

Includes a BESS project with a capacity of up to approx. 3 MW.\nTotal Portfolio\n120.5\nAndrea Cattaneo, Chief Executive Officer of Zenith Energy, commented:\n\"We are pleased to have secured an additional agrivoltaic development project in Piedmont, further strengthening Zenith's footprint in a high-demand industrial area in the Province of Alessandria. This acquisition reflects our continued focus on building a high-quality Italian solar pipeline and advancing it efficiently through permitting and grid-connection milestones.\nWith this latest addition, Zenith's Italian solar portfolio increases to 120.5 MWp, reinforcing the scale and strategic positioning of our regional clusters across Piedmont, Puglia and Lazio.\nWe believe we can reach a portfolio of 200 MWp by the end of 2026, while maintaining at the same time the strict discipline we adopted in 2025 in the choice of locations.\nOur priority remains to progress projects toward Ready-to-Build status, enabling us to both realise near-term value through selective monetisation and to construct selected assets to generate tangible and recurring production revenue.\"\nFurther Information\n:\nZenith Energy Ltd\u00a0Andrea Cattaneo, Chief Executive Officer\nTel: +1 (587) 315 1279\nE:\ninfo@zenithenergy.ca\nNotes to\u00a0Editors:\nZenith Energy Ltd.\u00a0is a revenue generating, independent energy company with energy production, exploration and development assets in\u00a0North Africa, the US and\u00a0Europe.

Its lawyers also advise on multi-jurisdictional litigation strategy, enforcement and parallel proceedings, expertise directly relevant to the ICSID arbitration brought by the Company's UK subsidiaries under the UK-Tunisia Bilateral Investment Treaty.\nAndrea Cattaneo, Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"\nThe legal team, led by Professor Thomas Clay and comprised of Ma\u00eetre Simon Le Wita of Charles Russell Speechlys Paris, alongside Ben Juratowitch KC and Matthieu Gregoire of Essex Court Chambers, is already exceptionally strong and has thoroughly and robustly presented the merits of the position in progressing the ICSID arbitration brought by the Company's UK subsidiaries under the UK-Tunisia Bilateral Investment Treaty.\nThe Company is very pleased to further complement and broaden the skillset and expertise of this team with the addition of Andrea Pinna. Mr. Pinna brings significant experience in investor-state and international commercial arbitration, including acting in numerous proceedings across the energy sector, and substantial experience representing sovereign states and addressing issues of sovereign immunity.\nWe look forward to the final hearings in April 2026 with well-grounded optimism and a sincere belief in redress and compensation for the prolonged damages suffered by the Company's UK subsidiary claimants, which have been significantly impaired as a result of arbitrary and unlawful conduct that has resulted in the sequestration and expropriatory termination of their activities and assets. All members of the legal team share a clear and unshakable assessment of the strength of the position, supported by the extensive preparation undertaken to date.\nThe Company remains firmly focused on securing redress for the significant damage its UK subsidiary claimants have suffered in Tunisia, and which, as recent events demonstrate, the UK subsidiary claimants continue to suffer because of arbitrary and unlawful conduct by the authorities in the Republic of Tunisia. The next months will have a transformational impact on the company, and every action will be taken to defend the rights of the Company's UK subsidiary claimants and vindicate the merits of their position\n.\"\nFurther Information\n:\nZenith Energy Ltd\nAndrea Cattaneo, Chief Executive Officer\nTel: +1 (587) 315 1279\nE: info@zenithenergy.ca\nNotes to Editors:\nZenith Energy Ltd. is a revenue generating, independent energy company with energy production, exploration and development assets in North Africa, the US and Europe.
