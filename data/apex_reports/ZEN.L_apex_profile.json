      "All quantitative metrics (ATR, StdDev, social sentiment, RNS) are zero, yet the crash signal reports an 85.4% drawdown and a base score of 8/21\u2014indicating a data mismatch or a ticker that has been removed from active trading.",

      "The entry price recorded as 0.00p suggests either a zero\u2011price float (possible post\u2011liquidation or reverse split) or a placeholder value, implying the stock may be in a suspended or delisted state with no tradable shares."

      "Contradictory signals: zero volatility and zero volume coexist with a massive crash drawdown, pointing to a data artifact rather than market activity.",

      "The \u2018dead ticker \u2013 UP\u2019 interpretation paired with +607% momentum is a contrarian red flag: investors often overlook such tickers, yet a sudden surge in search interest can precede a relisting or a liquidation payout.",
