      "The stock exhibits complete lack of market activity (zero price, zero ATR, zero 20\u2011day standard deviation) alongside a reported 85.4% drawdown, indicating that the price history may have been removed or the company is suspended/delisted.",
      "Google Trends flags the ticker as \"DEAD_TICKER\" yet shows a +333% momentum spike, a classic sign of algorithmic mis\u2011classification or a sudden, unscheduled re\u2011listing event that has not yet generated normal trading data.",
      "Absence of any recent RNS, catalysts or corporate announcements, coupled with no social sentiment or posts, signals either a data feed outage or a genuine lack of corporate activity, increasing the risk of a silent liquidation or restructuring."
    ],
    "hidden_patterns": [
      "Zero volatility metrics paired with a dramatic historical drawdown point to a data\u2011loss pattern: the ticker was likely active, peaked, then became inactive, and the historical data has been purged from the feed.",
      "The contradiction between a \"dead\" classification and a strong upward momentum indicator suggests that the algorithm may be reacting to a re\u2011ticker or a reverse\u2011takeover announcement that has not yet been reflected in the market data."

    "contrarian_signals": [
      "The \"dead_ticker - UP\" signal is a contrarian cue: if the ticker is indeed about to be revived (e.g., via a reverse takeover or re\u2011listing), early positioning before liquidity returns could generate significant upside.",

    "risk_warnings": [
      "Liquidity risk \u2013 with no price or volume data, any trade would be impossible or executed at extreme prices.",
      "Data integrity risk \u2013 the mismatch between crash indicators and zero volatility suggests a potential feed error or mis\u2011labeling, making all derived signals unreliable.",
