Mr. Pinna's practice primarily focuses on international commercial and investment arbitration. He has participated as counsel in more than fifty arbitration proceedings spanning a range of sectors, including disputes arising out of M&A transactions, joint-venture agreements, oil and gas.\nMr. Pinna has experience representing Sovereign States in international arbitration proceedings and before domestic courts, including matters involving sovereign immunities. He also appears frequently before French courts in arbitration-related disputes, including set-aside applications and the enforcement of arbitral awards. Mr. Pinna's practice further concentrates on international litigation and the management and coordination of multijurisdictional parallel proceedings, often connected to arbitration. Mr. Pinna is admitted to the Paris Bar and speaks Italian, French and English fluently, with working knowledge of Spanish.\nPinna Goldberg Law firm\nPinna Goldberg is an international disputes boutique advising sovereign states, companies, and individuals in resolving disputes through litigation, arbitration, and mediation. The firm advises on complex cross-border disputes and has experience representing states and investors in investment treaty matters, including under the ICSID and UNCITRAL frameworks. Its lawyers also advise on multi-jurisdictional litigation strategy, enforcement and parallel proceedings, expertise directly relevant to the ICSID arbitration brought by the Company's UK subsidiaries under the UK-Tunisia Bilateral Investment Treaty.\nAndrea Cattaneo, Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"\nThe legal team, led by Professor Thomas Clay and comprised of Ma\u00eetre Simon Le Wita of Charles Russell Speechlys Paris, alongside Ben Juratowitch KC and Matthieu Gregoire of Essex Court Chambers, is already exceptionally strong and has thoroughly and robustly presented the merits of the position in progressing the ICSID arbitration brought by the Company's UK subsidiaries under the UK-Tunisia Bilateral Investment Treaty.\nThe Company is very pleased to further complement and broaden the skillset and expertise of this team with the addition of Andrea Pinna. Mr. Pinna brings significant experience in investor-state and international commercial arbitration, including acting in numerous proceedings across the energy sector, and substantial experience representing sovereign states and addressing issues of sovereign immunity.\nWe look forward to the final hearings in April 2026 with well-grounded optimism and a sincere belief in redress and compensation for the prolonged damages suffered by the Company's UK subsidiary claimants, which have been significantly impaired as a result of arbitrary and unlawful conduct that has resulted in the sequestration and expropriatory termination of their activities and assets. All members of the legal team share a clear and unshakable assessment of the strength of the position, supported by the extensive preparation undertaken to date.\nThe Company remains firmly focused on securing redress for the significant damage its UK subsidiary claimants have suffered in Tunisia, and which, as recent events demonstrate, the UK subsidiary claimants continue to suffer because of arbitrary and unlawful conduct by the authorities in the Republic of Tunisia. The next months will have a transformational impact on the company, and every action will be taken to defend the rights of the Company's UK subsidiary claimants and vindicate the merits of their position\n.\"\nFurther Information\n:\nZenith Energy Ltd\nAndrea Cattaneo, Chief Executive Officer\nTel: +1 (587) 315 1279\nE: info@zenithenergy.ca\nNotes to Editors:\nZenith Energy Ltd. is a revenue generating, independent energy company with energy production, exploration and development assets in North Africa, the US and Europe.

These deposits are situated in the Lombardy region and comprise the Val Vedello deposit in the Province of Sondrio (\"\nVal Vedello\n\") and the Novazza deposit in the Province of Bergamo (\"\nNovazza\n\").\nProceeds will also be applied towards the construction of the Company's initial solar production assets in the Puglia region of Italy and to meet additional legal fees arising from the expansion of the Company's legal team in respect of its ongoing ICSID Arbitration against the Republic of Tunisia, as announced on 3 December 2025.\nProceeds will also be used for general working capital purposes.\nBroker Shares\nThe Company has allotted 3,221,429 new Common Shares (\"\nBroker Shares\n\"), in lieu of cash settlement for services provided to Zenith in connection with the Financings for a total value of 1,502,000 NOK (equivalent to approx. \u00a3112,500).\nThe Broker Shares will rank pari passu in all respects with the existing common shares of the Company.\nAn application for the Broker Shares to be listed on the standard segment of the FCA Official List and to be admitted for trading on the London Stock Exchange Main Market for listed securities will be made within 12 months of the issue of the Broker Shares.\nTotal Voting Rights\nThe Company announces the following information, in accordance with the Financial Conduct Authority's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules and section 3.10 and 3.11.5 (3) of the Euronext Growth Oslo Rule Book Part II, resulting from the issuance of the New Common Shares.\nClass of share\nTotal number of shares\nNumber of voting rights per share\nTotal number of voting rights per class of share\nCommon Shares in issue and admitted to trading on the Main Market of the\u00a0London Stock Exchange\n561,803,736\n1\n561,803,736\nCommon Shares in issue and admitted to trading on the Euronext Growth Market of the Oslo B\u00f8rs and Spotlight Market Stockholm\n649,182,327\n1\n649,182,327\nAndrea Cattaneo, Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"\nWe are pleased to have secured institutional investment at this key stage in our development. The first six months of 2026 will be characterised by potentially transformational activity for our business with the submission of two separate environmental impact assessments for the two largest Uranium deposits in Italy, the commencement of construction of our first solar plant in the Puglia region of Italy, and the final hearing of the ICSID arbitration in late April for a total claimed amount exceeding approximately US$572.65\nmillion.\nI am fully conscious of the painful dilution, and I am pleased to confirm that we do not anticipate conducting any further equity issuances for any of our existing activities until June 2026 at the very earliest following the Financings.\nThe Board sees significant scope for our market valuation to return to prior levels following the value catalysts that lie before us, following the shock represented by the entirely unexpected and flawed verdict of the ICC-2 arbitration.\n\"\nFurther Information\n:\nZenith Energy Ltd\nAndrea Cattaneo, Chief Executive Officer\nTel: +1 (587) 315 1279\nE: info@zenithenergy.ca\nNotes to Editors:\nZenith Energy Ltd. is a revenue generating, independent energy company with energy production, exploration and development assets in North Africa, the US and Europe.

(\"\nZenith\n\" or the \"\nCompany\n\") (\nLSE\n:\nZEN\n;\nOSE\n:\nZENA\n;\nXSAT\n:\nZENA\nSDR\n), the listed international energy production and development company,\u00a0is pleased to\nannounce that it has received the results of an independent valuation of its existing solar energy development pipeline (the \"\nDevelopment Pipeline\n\").\nThe independent valuation has been conducted by a prominent Italian consultancy firm with recognised expertise in the renewable energy and solar industries. As it is based on specific assumptions and information, the valuation remains subject to the inherent risks and uncertainties typical of renewable energy project development.\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nTotal Development Pipeline capacity\n: 110.5 MWp.\n\u00b7\nIndependent valuation of the Development Pipeline:\n\u20ac27,500,000.00 (approximately US$32 million / NOK 322 million / SEK 300 million).\nZenith has previously informed the market of its intention to sell a 50% interest in the portfolio once projects reach Ready-to-Build\n(\"RTB\")\nstatus. Based on the independent valuation, the implied value of a 50% interest is\n\u20ac13.75 million\n.\nThe Development Pipeline comprises a continuous stream of projects progressing through key development milestones, including:\n\u00b7\nSecuring control of project sites.\n\u00b7\nPermitting and authorisations for the installation of Photovoltaic panels and associated equipment.\n\u00b7\nSecuring connection to the power grid.\nRTB is the stage at which the principal permits, authorisations and grid connection requirements are in place, enabling construction to commence. Following RTB, projects progress through construction and commissioning, with commercial revenues generated once projects are connected and operational.\nAndrea Cattaneo, Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"\nZenith is an industrial company with a strong track record of bringing energy assets into production. We began producing oil in July 2010, natural gas in June 2013, and electricity in July 2014.\nFollowing the asset seizures carried out by the Republic of Tunisia, we made the strategic decision to broaden our industrial base by focusing on Europe and expanding into the development and construction of solar parks. As part of this strategy, we have grown our solar development pipeline from an initial target of 20 MWp to 110.5 MWp.\nThe independent valuation we have received supports this strategic direction and confirms the potential attractiveness of the 50% interest we plan to offer for sale once the projects reach RTB status. We believe this provides shareholders with additional reassurance regarding the value-creation potential of our renewable energy development activities\n.\"\nFurther Information\n:\nZenith Energy Ltd\nAndrea Cattaneo, Chief Executive Officer\nTel: +1 (587) 315 1279\nE: info@zenithenergy.ca\nNotes to Editors:\nZenith Energy Ltd. is a revenue generating, independent energy company with energy production, exploration and development assets in North Africa, the US and Europe.\nZenith Energy is listed on the London Stock Exchange Main Market (LSE:ZEN), has its entire common share capital admitted to trading on the Euronext Growth of the Oslo Stock Exchange (OSE:ZENA), and has Swedish Depository Receipts admitted to the Spotlight Stock Market in Sweden (XSAT: ZENA SDR).\nZenith's strategic focus is on pursuing development opportunities through the development of proven revenue generating energy production assets, as well as low-risk exploration activities in assets with existing production.\nFor more information, please visit: www.zenithenergy.ca\nTwitter: @zenithenergyltd\nLinkedIn:\nhttps://bit.ly/3A5PRJb\nMarket Abuse Regulation (MAR) Disclosure\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014 as it forms part of\u00a0UK\u00a0domestic law by virtue of the\u00a0European Union\u00a0(Withdrawal) Act 2018 (\"\nMAR\n\").

Before joining the Bar, he served as the global Head of Public International Law at Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer.

He advises and represents governments, corporations and individuals in disputes across sectors including energy, mining, manufacturing and financial services, often involving allegations of civil fraud and other cross-border misconduct.\nHe has appeared before all levels of the English courts and has extensive experience in investment treaty arbitration under ICSID, SCC, UNCITRAL and ad hoc rules, including matters arising under the OIC Investment Agreement and intra-EU bilateral investment treaties.

He was appointed to the Attorney General's Public International Law C Panel in 2017. He holds an LLM from Georgetown University, a Master's degree from Sciences Po and a BA in Law from the University of Cambridge.\nEssex Court Chambers\nEssex Court Chambers is a leading group of specialist barristers with deep experience in international arbitration and public international law-expertise directly relevant to the ICSID arbitration brought by the Company's UK subsidiaries under the UK-Tunisia Bilateral Investment Treaty. Its members regularly act in significant investor-state disputes under the ICSID Convention and other major arbitral frameworks, and frequently appear before the English courts in matters concerning arbitration, enforcement and interim measures.\nAndrea Cattaneo, Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"The legal team, led by Professor Thomas Clay and comprised of Ma\u00eetre Simon Le Wita of Charles Russell Speechlys Paris, is already exceptionally strong and has thoroughly and robustly presented the merits of the position in progressing the ICSID arbitration brought by the Company's UK subsidiaries under the UK-Tunisia Bilateral Investment Treaty. The Company is very pleased to further complement and broaden the skillset and expertise of this team with the addition of Ben Juratowitch KC and Matthieu Gregoire. Ben brings extensive experience in public international law and investor-state arbitration, including acting in proceedings before the International Court of Justice and multiple ICSID tribunals. Matthieu adds significant expertise in commercial and investment treaty arbitration, including disputes involving states and cross-border allegations of misconduct. Their combined experience is directly relevant to the issues at the centre of the UK-Tunisia 1989 Bilateral Investment Treaty, and their arrival adds further depth to the representation at a seminal juncture in the ICSID arbitration against the Republic of Tunisia.\nWe look forward to the final hearings in April 2026 with well-grounded optimism and a sincere belief in redress and compensation for the prolonged damages suffered by\nthe Company's UK\nsubsidiary claimants\n, which have been significantly impaired as a result of arbitrary and unlawful conduct that has resulted in the sequestration and expropriatory termination of their activities and assets. All members of the legal team share a clear and unshakable assessment of the strength of the position, supported by the extensive preparation undertaken to date. The Company remains firmly focused on securing redress for the significant damage\nits UK subsidiary claimants\nhave suffered in Tunisia, and which, as recent events demonstrate,\nthe\nUK subsidiary claimants\ncontinue to suffer because of arbitrary and unlawful conduct by the authorities in the Republic of Tunisia. The next five months will have a transformational impact on the Zenith Group, and every possible action will be taken to defend the rights of\nthe Company's UK subsidiary claimants\nand vindicate the merits of their position.\"\nFurther Information\n:\nZenith Energy Ltd\nAndrea Cattaneo, Chief Executive Officer\nTel: +1 (587) 315 1279\nE: info@zenithenergy.ca\nNotes to Editors:\nZenith Energy Ltd. is a revenue generating, independent energy company with energy production, exploration and development assets in North Africa, the US and Europe.\nZenith Energy is listed on the London Stock Exchange Main Market (LSE:ZEN), has its entire common share capital admitted to trading on the Euronext Growth of the Oslo Stock Exchange (OSE:ZENA), and has Swedish Depository Receipts admitted to the Spotlight Stock Market in Sweden (XSAT: ZENA SDR).\nZenith's strategic focus is on pursuing development opportunities through the development of proven revenue generating energy production assets, as well as low-risk exploration activities in assets with existing production.\nFor more information, please visit: www.zenithenergy.ca\nTwitter: @zenithenergyltd\nLinkedIn:\nhttps://bit.ly/3A5PRJb\nMarket Abuse Regulation (MAR) Disclosure\nThe information contained within this announcement is deemed by the Company to constitute inside information as stipulated under the Market Abuse Regulations (EU) No. 596/2014 as it forms part of\u00a0UK\u00a0domestic law by virtue of the\u00a0European Union\u00a0(Withdrawal) Act 2018 (\"\nMAR\n\").
