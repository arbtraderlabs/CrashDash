      "Google Trends flags the ticker as \u2018DEAD_TICKER\u2019 but simultaneously shows a +607\u202f% momentum spike, a classic pattern of algorithmic noise or a short\u2011lived rumor that never translated into real market activity.",
      "The absence of any RNS filings, catalysts, or risk flags, coupled with the base score of 8/21, indicates a data\u2011feed or listing anomaly rather than a genuine distressed equity."

      "The dissonance between 0/100 current interest and a 607\u202f% momentum surge is symptomatic of a \u201cdead ticker\u201d that is being artificially promoted by bots or a single whale account, not organic investor interest."

      "The crash signal\u2019s bottom\u2011zone classification might be misinterpreted; in a truly inactive security, the \u2018bottom\u2019 is simply the last traded price (0.00p), not a genuine market bottom."

    "risk_warnings": [
      "High probability of liquidity risk \u2013 zero volume and zero volatility mean any trade would be impossible or executed at a catastrophic price.",

The crash signal is likely a data glitch rather than a genuine market event. Investors should treat this ticker as high\u2011risk, with no actionable upside unless a clear relisting or reverse takeover emerges."
