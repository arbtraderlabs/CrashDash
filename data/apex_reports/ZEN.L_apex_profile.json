(\n\"Zenith\"\nor the\n\"Company\"\n) (\nLSE: ZEN; OSE: ZENA; XSAT: ZENA SDR\n), the listed international energy production and development company, is pleased to announce the acquisition of an agrivoltaic project at development stage located in the Piedmont region of Italy (the\n\"Acquisition\"\n), through its wholly-owned Italian subsidiary, responsible for managing its solar energy portfolio, WESOLAR S.R.L. (\n\"WESOLAR\"\n).\nOverview of the Acquisition\n\u2022 The Acquisition comprises a photovoltaic solar energy production project located in the Piedmont region, with an expected installed capacity of approximately 10 MWp.\n\u2022 The Acquisition is classified as being in the development stage.\n\u2022 Piedmont, and particularly the Province of Alessandria, where the new plant will be developed, is one of the most industrialised areas in Italy. This characteristic makes the sale of electricity from renewable sources particularly profitable, due to strong local energy demand. Demand to acquire this type of project remains consistently high.\n\u2022 This additional acquisition in Piedmont enables Zenith to further consolidate its significant presence in the region, where approximately 60 MWp of projects are already under development, while at the same time complementing the Company's existing pipeline in Piedmont, Puglia and Lazio.\n\u2022 Italy stands out as one of the world's leading countries in the development and implementation of photovoltaic technology.\n\u2022 The Company expects the project to reach Ready-to-Build status within the next 12-15 months.\n\u2022 The consideration for the acquisition of the land for the new project amounts to EUR 768,215.00, conditional upon the achievement of all necessary permits to reach Ready-to-Build status.\nAdvanced negotiations are currently underway for the acquisition of two additional projects.\nStrategy Overview\nIn the solar energy industry, a \"pipeline\" refers to the aggregate portfolio of development projects being actively advanced toward construction day after day. Zenith's pipeline is composed of projects progressing daily through design, permitting, and grid-connection milestones, moving step by step toward Ready-to-Build (\n\"RtB\"\n) status. This expanding portfolio carries tangible market value, which typically increases as projects mature and de-risk through successive development stages.\nAs previously announced in the Company's regulatory news announcement dated December 4, 2025, Zenith received the results of an independent valuation of its existing solar energy development pipeline (the\n\"Pipeline\"\n). At that time, the pipeline totalled 110.5 MWp and was independently valued at \u20ac27,500,000.00.\nSince the independent valuation was completed, Zenith's solar portfolio has increased to 120.5 MWp as of February 2, 2026. Accordingly, the previously announced independent valuation does not reflect the additional capacity acquired since that date. The Company believes that the increase in portfolio capacity provides further support for the value-creation potential of its renewable energy development activities, although no updated independent valuation has been published for the enlarged portfolio.\nZenith intends to maintain a balanced approach across its Italian portfolio, progressing projects toward RtB status while selectively assessing opportunities to monetise portions of the development pipeline with professional counterparties, and to construct selected assets to establish tangible and recurring electricity production revenue.\nOverview of Zenith Energy's Solar Portfolio (as of February 2, 2026)\nProject / Stage\nCapacity (MWp)\nStatus\nNotes\nLiguria Solar Asset\n0.5\nProduction Upgrade\nCurrently producing 0.2 MWp, upgrade to 0.5 MWp planned.\nLazio Agrivoltaic Project 1\n10.0\nDevelopment\nFirst Lazio acquisition (10 MWp) announced Aug 6, 2025.\nLazio Agrivoltaic Project 2\n7.0\nDevelopment\nFirst announced on August 27, 2025, installed capacity has been increased to 7 MWp from 5 MWp.\nPiedmont Agrivoltaic Development Projects\n30.0\nDevelopment\nAcquisition comprising of various agrivoltaics projects announced on August 11, 2025.\nPiedmont PV Development Project\n10.0\nDevelopment\nOriginally an Agrivoltaic project, subsequently reclassified to conventional solar energy as announced on August 22, 2025.\nPiedmont Agrivoltaic Development Project\n18.0\nDevelopment\nAcquisition signed and announced on October 19, 2025.\nPiedmont Advanced Agrivoltaic Development Project\n10.0\nDevelopment\nAcquisition announced on February 2, 2026.

(\"\nZenith\n\" or the \"\nCompany\n\") (\nLSE: ZEN; OSE: ZENA; XSAT: ZENA SDR\n), the listed international energy production and development company, is delighted to announce the appointment of Andrea Pinna, Partner at Pinna Goldberg, to further broaden and complement the legal team of its claimant subsidiaries in the arbitration proceedings brought before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\n\"ICSID\"\n) under the UK-Tunisia Bilateral Investment Treaty, against the Republic of Tunisia, led by Professor Thomas Clay (Clay Arbitration) alongside Ma\u00eetre Simon Le Wita (Charles Russell Speechlys Paris), and by Ben Juratowitch KC and Matthieu Gregoire (Essex Court Chambers).\nAndrea Pinna\nAndrea Pinna is a Partner at Pinna Goldberg, based in Paris, London, Washington and Dubai. Mr. Pinna's practice primarily focuses on international commercial and investment arbitration. He has participated as counsel in more than fifty arbitration proceedings spanning a range of sectors, including disputes arising out of M&A transactions, joint-venture agreements, oil and gas.\nMr. Pinna has experience representing Sovereign States in international arbitration proceedings and before domestic courts, including matters involving sovereign immunities. He also appears frequently before French courts in arbitration-related disputes, including set-aside applications and the enforcement of arbitral awards. Mr. Pinna's practice further concentrates on international litigation and the management and coordination of multijurisdictional parallel proceedings, often connected to arbitration. Mr. Pinna is admitted to the Paris Bar and speaks Italian, French and English fluently, with working knowledge of Spanish.\nPinna Goldberg Law firm\nPinna Goldberg is an international disputes boutique advising sovereign states, companies, and individuals in resolving disputes through litigation, arbitration, and mediation. The firm advises on complex cross-border disputes and has experience representing states and investors in investment treaty matters, including under the ICSID and UNCITRAL frameworks. Its lawyers also advise on multi-jurisdictional litigation strategy, enforcement and parallel proceedings, expertise directly relevant to the ICSID arbitration brought by the Company's UK subsidiaries under the UK-Tunisia Bilateral Investment Treaty.\nAndrea Cattaneo, Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"\nThe legal team, led by Professor Thomas Clay and comprised of Ma\u00eetre Simon Le Wita of Charles Russell Speechlys Paris, alongside Ben Juratowitch KC and Matthieu Gregoire of Essex Court Chambers, is already exceptionally strong and has thoroughly and robustly presented the merits of the position in progressing the ICSID arbitration brought by the Company's UK subsidiaries under the UK-Tunisia Bilateral Investment Treaty.\nThe Company is very pleased to further complement and broaden the skillset and expertise of this team with the addition of Andrea Pinna. Mr. Pinna brings significant experience in investor-state and international commercial arbitration, including acting in numerous proceedings across the energy sector, and substantial experience representing sovereign states and addressing issues of sovereign immunity.\nWe look forward to the final hearings in April 2026 with well-grounded optimism and a sincere belief in redress and compensation for the prolonged damages suffered by the Company's UK subsidiary claimants, which have been significantly impaired as a result of arbitrary and unlawful conduct that has resulted in the sequestration and expropriatory termination of their activities and assets. All members of the legal team share a clear and unshakable assessment of the strength of the position, supported by the extensive preparation undertaken to date.\nThe Company remains firmly focused on securing redress for the significant damage its UK subsidiary claimants have suffered in Tunisia, and which, as recent events demonstrate, the UK subsidiary claimants continue to suffer because of arbitrary and unlawful conduct by the authorities in the Republic of Tunisia. The next months will have a transformational impact on the company, and every action will be taken to defend the rights of the Company's UK subsidiary claimants and vindicate the merits of their position\n.\"\nFurther Information\n:\nZenith Energy Ltd\nAndrea Cattaneo, Chief Executive Officer\nTel: +1 (587) 315 1279\nE: info@zenithenergy.ca\nNotes to Editors:\nZenith Energy Ltd. is a revenue generating, independent energy company with energy production, exploration and development assets in North Africa, the US and Europe.

The Company has also issued broker shares (the \"\nBroker Shares\n\") (collectively, the \"\nFinancings\n\").\nThe Financings have included the participation of new and existing investors to raise an aggregate total amount of approximately \u00a33,658,500 (equivalent to approx.

These deposits are situated in the Lombardy region and comprise the Val Vedello deposit in the Province of Sondrio (\"\nVal Vedello\n\") and the Novazza deposit in the Province of Bergamo (\"\nNovazza\n\").\nProceeds will also be applied towards the construction of the Company's initial solar production assets in the Puglia region of Italy and to meet additional legal fees arising from the expansion of the Company's legal team in respect of its ongoing ICSID Arbitration against the Republic of Tunisia, as announced on 3 December 2025.\nProceeds will also be used for general working capital purposes.\nBroker Shares\nThe Company has allotted 3,221,429 new Common Shares (\"\nBroker Shares\n\"), in lieu of cash settlement for services provided to Zenith in connection with the Financings for a total value of 1,502,000 NOK (equivalent to approx. \u00a3112,500).\nThe Broker Shares will rank pari passu in all respects with the existing common shares of the Company.\nAn application for the Broker Shares to be listed on the standard segment of the FCA Official List and to be admitted for trading on the London Stock Exchange Main Market for listed securities will be made within 12 months of the issue of the Broker Shares.\nTotal Voting Rights\nThe Company announces the following information, in accordance with the Financial Conduct Authority's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules and section 3.10 and 3.11.5 (3) of the Euronext Growth Oslo Rule Book Part II, resulting from the issuance of the New Common Shares.\nClass of share\nTotal number of shares\nNumber of voting rights per share\nTotal number of voting rights per class of share\nCommon Shares in issue and admitted to trading on the Main Market of the\u00a0London Stock Exchange\n561,803,736\n1\n561,803,736\nCommon Shares in issue and admitted to trading on the Euronext Growth Market of the Oslo B\u00f8rs and Spotlight Market Stockholm\n649,182,327\n1\n649,182,327\nAndrea Cattaneo, Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"\nWe are pleased to have secured institutional investment at this key stage in our development. The first six months of 2026 will be characterised by potentially transformational activity for our business with the submission of two separate environmental impact assessments for the two largest Uranium deposits in Italy, the commencement of construction of our first solar plant in the Puglia region of Italy, and the final hearing of the ICSID arbitration in late April for a total claimed amount exceeding approximately US$572.65\nmillion.\nI am fully conscious of the painful dilution, and I am pleased to confirm that we do not anticipate conducting any further equity issuances for any of our existing activities until June 2026 at the very earliest following the Financings.\nThe Board sees significant scope for our market valuation to return to prior levels following the value catalysts that lie before us, following the shock represented by the entirely unexpected and flawed verdict of the ICC-2 arbitration.\n\"\nFurther Information\n:\nZenith Energy Ltd\nAndrea Cattaneo, Chief Executive Officer\nTel: +1 (587) 315 1279\nE: info@zenithenergy.ca\nNotes to Editors:\nZenith Energy Ltd. is a revenue generating, independent energy company with energy production, exploration and development assets in North Africa, the US and Europe.
