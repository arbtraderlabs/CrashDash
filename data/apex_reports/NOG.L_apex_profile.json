ZKM understands that the Appeal Board is reviewing and considering communications from the Dutch tax authority pursuant to the mutual agreement procedure (\"\nMAP\n\") under the relevant double tax treaty between the Kingdom of\u00a0the Netherlands\u00a0and the RoK (the \"\nRoK-NL Treaty\n\") in respect of the pertinent claims, which may result in the suspension of the appeal pending the outcome of the MAP.\nParagraph 3 of Article 4 of the RoK Constitution provides that international treaties ratified by the RoK (such as the RoK-NL Treaty) have priority over RoK domestic laws (including the RoK tax code) and RoK Supreme Court precedent provides that where an international treaty contains a mutual agreement procedure such as the MAP, for the good faith performance of the treaty such mutual agreement procedure, when invoked, should be conducted between the competent authorities of the two states party to the treaty to achieve the goals of such treaty. A treaty party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for a failure to perform its treaty obligations.\nAs previously announced, the Company believes that the tax claims made by the RoK tax authorities resulting from their tax audits of ZKM for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020, which deny ZKM the benefit of relevant and valid exemptions from, or reductions to, withholding tax payable under RoK law on certain bonds issued by Group companies, remuneration on an intra-Group loan, and income from consulting services, respectively, are without merit.\nThe Company continues to monitor developments closely and will continue to defend its interests and to assess all available legal and treaty-based remedies.\nFurther updates will be issued as appropriate.\nLEI: 2138007VWEP4MM3J8B29\nFurther information\nFor further information please visit\nwww.nostrumoilandgas.com\nFurther enquiries\nNostrum Oil & Gas PLC\nYelena Zhuravleva, CFO\nir@nog.co.uk\nTEAM LEWIS\nGalyna Kulachek\n+ 44 (0) 20 7802 2664\nnostrum@teamlewis.com\nAbout\u00a0Nostrum Oil & Gas\nNostrum Oil & Gas PLC\u00a0is an independent mixed-asset energy company with world-class gas processing facilities and export hub in north-west Kazakhstan.

The tax authorities have asserted withholding tax claims for such three year period totalling approximately USD 71 million (comprising USD 52 million relating to the 2018/2019 audits and USD 19 million in potential claims for 2020), which the Company believes contradict applicable laws and treaties and arbitral, administrative and judicial practice. Since commencement of operations in Kazakhstan in 1997, ZKM has paid in aggregate more than USD 1.24 billion in taxes, royalties and other payments to the RoK\n.\nOn 28 January 2026, ZKM was informed that the RoK Ministry of Finance Appeal Board has scheduled a hearing on 5 February 2026 to consider ZKM's appeals of the tax audits for 2018 and 2019, following the resumption of proceedings after a prior period of suspension. The Company expects that the Appeal Board will consider all relevant facts together with national and international laws, and take into account all relevant treaties, including the relevant double tax treaty between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and RoK, pursuant to which the Dutch tax authorities have initiated a mutual agreement procedure (\"\nMAP\n\") in respect of the pertinent claims. The outcome of the hearing remains uncertain and may result in further procedural steps in accordance with applicable laws rather than a final determination.\nThe scheduling of the hearing represents a further step in the progression of the dispute. The Company continues to monitor developments closely and to take appropriate steps to protect its interests.\nThe Company is incorporated under the laws of England and Wales and listed on the London Stock Exchange. Its investor base is international, with investors predominantly based in the United States. In addition, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary Nostrum Oil & Gas Finance BV, incorporated in the Netherlands, is the issuer of the Group's senior secured notes and senior unsecured notes.\nThe Company will continue to defend its interests and to assess all available legal remedies.\nFurther updates will be issued as appropriate.\nLEI: 2138007VWEP4MM3J8B29\nFurther information\nFor further information please visit\nwww.nostrumoilandgas.com\nFurther enquiries\nNostrum Oil & Gas PLC\nYelena Zhuravleva, CFO\nir@nog.co.uk\nTEAM LEWIS\nGalyna Kulachek\n+ 44 (0) 20 7802 2664\nnostrum@teamlewis.com\nAbout Nostrum Oil & Gas\nNostrum Oil & Gas PLC is an independent mixed-asset energy company with world-class gas processing facilities and export hub in north-west Kazakhstan.

This update is being issued in advance of the release of Nostrum's audited consolidated accounts for the same period. The financial information disclosed in this announcement is unaudited and remains subject to the completion of Nostrum's year-end external audit.\nViktor Gladun, Chief Executive Officer of Nostrum Oil & Gas, commented:\n\"Nostrum remains dedicated to driving strategic growth through strong leadership while upholding the highest standards of health and safety.\n2025 was a year of continued operational and strategic progress, achieved despite lower oil prices and natural decline at the mature Chinarevskoye Field. The business demonstrated resilience through reliable operations, disciplined capital management, and a 23.2% increase in average processed volumes, driven by the ramp\u2011up of third-party feedstock and stable plant performance. Together with the successful drilling and workover programme at Chinarevskoye, this resulted in higher titled production and sales volumes year-on-year. New well 116_1 was brought onstream at the end of November 2025 following the successful completion activities and is delivering production levels consistent with management's expectations.\nDuring the year, we advanced planning for the Stepnoy Leopard development options while ensuring alignment with project objectives and regulatory requirements.\nLooking ahead, Nostrum remains focused on maximising asset value, deepening strategic partnerships, restructuring debt maturing in June 2026, maintaining financial discipline, and delivering enduring benefits for shareholders, stakeholders and the people of Kazakhstan.\"\nFY 2025 Highlights:\nOperational\n\u00b7\nProduction and sales\n\u00a7\nA 23.2% increase in average processed volumes (including third party condensate tolling volumes) to 24,431 boepd in FY 2025 (FY 2024: 19,831 boepd). A 12.9% increase in average daily titled production volumes (i.e. final products processed and owned by Nostrum) to 16,867 boepd in FY 2025 (FY 2024: 14,935 boepd). These increases were achieved through continuing to process the ramping up feedstock from Ural Oil & Gas\u00a0LLP\u00a0(\"Ural O&G\"), and managing expected decline in Chinarevskoye production through well workovers.\n\u00a7\nThe titled production volume split was as follows:\nProducts\nFY 2025\nvolumes\n(boepd)\nFY 2024\nvolumes\n(boepd)\nY-on-Y\nChange\n(%)\nFY 2025\nproduct mix\n(%)\nFY 2024\nproduct mix\n(%)\nCrude Oil\n2,343\n2,536\n(7.6)%\n13.9%\n17.0%\nStabilised Condensate*\n1,664\n1,897\n(12.3)%\n9.9%\n12.7%\nLPG (Liquid Petroleum Gas)\n3,162\n2,537\n24.6%\n18.7%\n17.0%\nDry Gas\n9,698\n7,965\n21.8%\n57.5%\n53.3%\nTotal\n16,867\n14,935\n12.9%\n100.0%\n100.0%\n*Stabilised condensate volumes exclude Ural O&G processed volumes for which Nostrum receives a fixed tolling fee\n\u00a7\nA 16.2% increase in average daily sales volumes to 15,146 boepd in FY 2025 (FY 2024: 13,038 boepd), reflecting higher titled production. The difference between titled production and sales volumes is primarily due to the internal consumption of dry gas produced and timing of product deliveries, which may lead to inventory increases or decreases at period end.\n\u00b7\nChinarevskoye drilling and workover programme\nThe Company's Chinarevskoye limited-scale drilling programme for 2025 targeted most economic subsurface opportunities while also ensuring compliance with license obligations.\nOn 13 October 2025, the Company successfully completed drilling operations on the well 116_1. After completing perforation, stimulation and flowline tie-in, the well was put on production on 21 November 2025, achieving production rates in line with management's expectations. In parallel, during the year the Company continued to carry out optimised well workovers to minimise production decline and enhance operational efficiency.\nA comprehensive review and assessment of potential well workovers and new drilling prospects is underway.\n\u00b7\nStepnoy Leopard Fields\nA comprehensive review of the overall development strategy for the Stepnoy Leopard Fields is underway, taking into account key factors such as project economics, infrastructure access, sales delivery points, compliance with regulatory requirements and licence commitments.\n\u00b7\nProcessing of Ural O&G products\nThroughout FY 2025, the Company continued processing raw gas and condensate volumes from Ural O&G, resulting in the increases in titled production and processed volumes. As announced on 21 March 2025, the Company signed a new agreement with Ural O&G, extending third-party hydrocarbon processing terms through May 2031, strengthening cash flows, supporting efficient plant operations, and facilitating cost-effective development of the Rozhkovskoye field.\nFinancial\n\u00b7\nFY 2025 revenue is estimated to be approximately\u00a0US$118 million\u00a0(FY 2024:\u00a0US$137.1 million). The increase in titled production and processed volumes from Ural O&G feedstock and continued well workover had a positive impact on revenues. However, this was offset by a natural production decline at the Chinarevskoye field (approximately 21% decrease in production) and a 13.2% decrease in the average Brent crude oil price (US$70.0/bbl in FY 2025 vs US$80.6/bbl in FY 2024).\n\u00b7\nThe unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balance as at\u00a031 December 2025\u00a0was in excess of\u00a0US$143 million\u00a0(31 December 2024:\u00a0US$150.4 million). The restricted cash balance (debt service retention account (\"DSRA\") and asset liquidation fund)\u00a0was in excess of\u00a0US$26 million\u00a0as at\u00a031 December 2025\u00a0(31 December 2024:\u00a0US$25.9 million).\n\u00b7\nIn FY 2025, the Group generated a healthy net operating cashflow, before non-recurring items. After the limited capital expenditures on the Chinarevskoye and Stepnoy Leopard fields and one-off payments under the management incentive plan the Group's unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balance reduced by approximately\u00a0US$7 million during FY 2025.\n\u00b7\nThe Group remains focused on maximising facility uptime with the annual plant maintenance completed earlier than planned, controlling costs wherever possible, and improving efficiencies across all facets of business. At the same time, we are committed to allocating and utilising resources efficiently to support our growth projects.\nHSE and ESG\n\u00b7\nZero fatalities among employees and contractors during operations in 2025 (2024: zero).\n\u00b7\nTotal Recordable Incidents Rate (incidents per million man-hours) of 0.92 in 2025 (2024:0.63).\n\u00b7\nZero Lost Time Injury Rate (incidents per million man-hours) in 2025 (2024: zero).\n\u00b7\n4,048 tonnes of air emissions emitted in 2025 against 5,188 tonnes permitted for 2025 under the Kazakhstan Environmental Code.\n\u00b7\nSafety of all staff and contractors, along with a commitment to sustainable operations, remains the Group's priority.\n2026 production guidance\n\u200b\n2026 average daily production for the Chinarevskoye field is forecast at 5,000 - 6,000 boepd.\nRelease of Nostrum's 2025 Financial Results\n\u200b\nNostrum plans to release its annual report and audited financial statements in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2025\u00a0on\u00a0or around\u00a029 April 2026.\nLEI: 2138007VWEP4MM3J8B29\nFurther information\nFor further information please visit\nwww.nostrumoilandgas.com\nFurther enquiries\nNostrum Oil & Gas PLC\nElena Zhuravleva\nChief Financial Officer\nir@nog.co.uk\nTEAM LEWIS\nGalyna Kulachek\n+ 44 (0) 20 7802 2664\nnostrum@teamlewis.com\nNotifying person\nThomas Hartnett\nCompany Secretary\nAbout Nostrum Oil & Gas\nNostrum Oil & Gas PLC is an independent mixed-asset energy company with world-class gas processing facilities and export hub in north-west Kazakhstan.
