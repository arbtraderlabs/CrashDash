The Issuer was subsequently required to have paid accrued interest on the Notes by 31 December, 2025, and such amount remains unpaid.

All underlying funds for making the interest payments are available and secured.\nThe Issuer has made the second consent fee payment as set out in the terms of the previously consummated consent solicitation which shall mean that no default or event of default is caused by the failure to make the interest payment on the Notes at this time.\u00a0Payment of the applicable consent fees shall be made by the relevant agent to the eligible holders in the coming days.\nTiming\nThe Parent thanks holders of the Notes for their support and participation surrounding these third party issues which have affected the interest payment due on the Notes.\nLEI: 2138007VWEP4MM3J8B29\nFurther information\nFor further information please visit\nwww.nostrumoilandgas.com\nFurther enquiries:\nNostrum Oil & Gas PLC\nThomas Hartnett - Chief Legal Officer / Company Secretary\nir@nog.co.uk\nTEAM LEWIS\nGalyna Kulachek\n+ 44 (0) 20 7802 2664\nnostrum@teamlewis.com\nNotifying person\nThomas Hartnett\nCompany Secretary\nAbout Nostrum Oil & Gas\nNostrum Oil & Gas PLC is an independent mixed-asset energy company with world-class gas processing facilities and export hub in north-west Kazakhstan.

I am pleased to welcome Robert Wynne to the Board of Directors as a Non-Executive Director, bringing extensive commercial experience and technical expertise in the oil and gas industry. During the first nine months of 2025, Nostrum demonstrated resilience and disciplined execution despite a challenging environment marked by weaker oil prices and the natural production decline of the mature Chinarevskoye field. We delivered an EBITDA of US$26.8 million, complemented by a 28% reduction in operating expenses per barrel processed, which reflects our improved processing efficiencies and growth in third-party volume processing. Additionally, we maintained a strong liquidity position, with net positive operating cash flow over the nine months of US$21.6 million before one-off items and unrestricted cash of US$147.3 million as of the period end. These results highlight the stability of our operations and the reliability of our infrastructure.\nLooking ahead, we remain deeply committed to create sustainable value for all our stakeholders and contributing positively to Kazakhstan's energy sector.\"\n9M 2025 Highlights:\nFinancial\n\u00b7\nRevenue of US$85.5 million (9M 2024: US$101.4 million). The increase in titled production and processed volumes from\nUral Oil & Gas LLP (\"Ural O&G\")\nfeedstock and continued well workovers had a positive impact on revenues. However, this was offset by natural production decline at the Chinarevskoye field and a 14% decrease in the average Brent crude oil price (US$70.95/bbl in 9M 2025 vs US$82.6/bbl in 9M 2024).\n\u00b7\nEBITDA1 of US$26.8 million (9M 2024: 34.7 million) and an EBITDA margin of 31.3% (9M 2024: 34.2%).\n\u00b7\nA 28% reduction in average operating expenses per barrel of processed volumes: US$4.7 during 9M 2025: (9M 2024: US$6.5).\n\u00b7\nThe Group's net positive operating cashflow was US$21.6 million, before one-off items. After limited capital expenditures on the Chinarevskoye and Stepnoy Leopard fields and one-off payments under the management incentive plan, the Group's unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balance reduced by US$3.1 million during 9M 2025.\n\u00b7\nThe unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balance of US$147.3 million as at 30 September 2025 (30 June 2025: US$135.9 million, 31 December 2024: US$150.4 million). The Group's restricted cash balance (debt service retention account (\"DSRA\") and asset liquidation fund) was US$26.3 million as at 30 September 2025 (30 June 2025: US$26.1 million, 31 December 2024: US$25.9 million).\n\u00b7\nNet debt2 of US$501.3 million as at 30 September 2025 (30 June 2025: US$473.1million, 31 December 2024: US$404.2 million). The Group's net debt mainly increased due to US$42.7\u202fmillion payment-in-kind interest capitalised on its Senior Unsecured Notes (SUNs),\nUS$14.2 million accrued cash interest\nand a US$50.1 million amortisation of the fair value adjustment. The increase was partially offset by the cancellation of US$5,628,000 Senior Secured Notes (SSNs) and US$9,629,836 SUNs in April 2025, pursuant to the terms of the holding period trust deed dated 9 February 2023.\n\u00b7\nWith respect to the US$8.3 million delayed SSN and SUN coupon payment, please refer to the Company's press releases dated 10 July, 22 July, 30 July, 2 September, 16 September, 24 September and 6 October 2025.\n\u00b7\nThe Group remains focused on maximising facility uptime with the annual plant maintenance completed earlier than planned, controlling costs wherever possible, and improving efficiencies across all facets of the business. At the same time, we are committed to allocating and utilising resources efficiently to support our growth projects.\nOperational\n\u00b7\nProduction and sales\n\u00b7\nA 33% increase in average processed volumes (including third party condensate tolling volumes) to 23,596 boepd in 9M 2025 (9M 2024: 17,748 boepd). An 18.5% increase in average daily titled production volumes (i.e. final products processed and owned by Nostrum) to 16,300 boepd in 9M 2025 (9M 2024: 13,758 boepd). These increases were achieved through continuing to process ramping up feedstock from Ural O&G, and managing expected decline in Chinarevskoye production through well workovers.\n\u00b7\nThe titled production volume split was as follows:\nProducts\n9M 2025\nvolumes\n(boepd)\n9M 2024\nvolumes\n(boepd)\nY-on-Y\nChange\n(%)\n9M 2025\nproduct mix\n(%)\n9M 2024\nproduct mix\n(%)\nCrude Oil\n2,403\n2,500\n(3.9)%\n14.7%\n18.2%\nStabilised Condensate*\n1,559\n1,824\n(14.5)%\n9.6%\n13.3%\nLPG (Liquid Petroleum Gas)\n3,038\n2,335\n30.1%\n18.6%\n17.0%\nDry Gas\n9,300\n7,099\n31.0%\n57.1%\n51.5%\nTotal\n16,300\n13,758\n18.5%\n100.0%\n100.0%\n*Stabilised condensate volumes exclude Ural O&G processed volumes for which Nostrum receives a fixed tolling fee\n\u00b7\nA 19.9% increase in average daily sales volumes to 14,339 boepd in 9M 2025 (9M 2024: 11,956 boepd), reflecting the increase in titled production. The difference between titled production and sales volumes is primarily due to the internal consumption of dry gas produced and timing of product deliveries, which may lead to inventory increases or decreases at the period end.\n\u00b7\nChinarevskoye drilling and workover programme\nThe Company's Chinarevskoye limited-scale drilling programme for 2025 is targeting the most economic subsurface opportunities while also ensuring compliance with license obligations. On 13 October 2025, the Company successfully completed drilling operations on well No.116_1, which was followed by well completion and testing over the following three weeks. In parallel, the Company continues to carry out optimised well workovers to minimise production decline and enhance operational efficiency.\n\u00b7\nStepnoy Leopard Fields\nIn April 2025, the Company received formal approval from Kazakhstan's Ministry of Energy for a phased Full-Field Development Plan (FDP) for the Stepnoy Leopard Fields. The Company is actively progressing with detailed design and engineering activities, alongside selective procurement, to ensure compliance with license commitments. Key development projects, including the pipeline to Chinarevskoye and the sour gas treatment infrastructure, continue to undergo rigorous review to ensure alignment with project objectives and regulatory requirements.\n\u00b7\nProcessing of Ural O&G products\nThroughout 9M 2025, the Company continued processing raw gas and condensate volumes from Ural O&G, resulting in increases in titled production and processed volumes. As announced on 21 March 2025, the Company signed a new agreement with Ural O&G, extending third-party hydrocarbon processing terms through May 2031, strengthening cash flows, supporting efficient plant operations, and facilitating cost-effective development of the Rozhkovskoye field.\nHSE and ESG\n\u00b7\nZero fatalities among employees and contractors during operations in 9M 2025 (9M 2024: zero).\n\u00b7\nTotal Recordable Incidents Rate (incidents per million man-hours) of 0.81 in 9M 2025 (9M 2024:0.84).\n\u00b7\nZero Lost Time Injury Rate (incidents per million man-hours) in 9M 2025 (9M 2024: zero).\n\u00b7\n3,087 tonnes of air emissions emitted in 9M 2025 against 5,188 tonnes permitted for 2025 under Kazakhstan's Environmental Code.\n\u00b7\nSafety of all staff and contractors, along with a commitment to sustainable operations, remains the Group's priority.\nNotes to press release\n1\nEBITDA is a non-IFRS measure and is defined as profit / loss before tax and depreciation, depletion and amortisation, share-based compensation, foreign exchange gains / losses, finance costs, interest income, other income, other expenses, and one-off items.\n2\nNet debt is defined as total debt (notes payable and accumulated interest) less cash and cash equivalents and DSRA.\nThe Company's 9M 2025 interim condensed consolidated financial statements are available to download from its website:\nDownload:\n9M 2025 Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\nLEI: 2138007VWEP4MM3J8B29\nFurther information\nFor further information please visit\nwww.nog.co.uk\nFurther enquiries\nNostrum Oil & Gas PLC\nElena Zhuravleva\nChief Financial Officer\nir@nog.co.uk\nInstinctif Partners - UK\nGalyna Kulachek\n+ 44 (0) 207 457 2020\nnostrum@instinctif.com\nNotifying person\nThomas Hartnett\nCompany Secretary\nAbout Nostrum Oil & Gas\nNostrum Oil & Gas PLC is an independent mixed-asset energy company with world-class gas processing facilities and export hub in north-west Kazakhstan.
