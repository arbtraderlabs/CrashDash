ZKM understands that the Appeal Board is reviewing and considering communications from the Dutch tax authority pursuant to the mutual agreement procedure (\"\nMAP\n\") under the relevant double tax treaty between the Kingdom of\u00a0the Netherlands\u00a0and the RoK (the \"\nRoK-NL Treaty\n\") in respect of the pertinent claims, which may result in the suspension of the appeal pending the outcome of the MAP.\nParagraph 3 of Article 4 of the RoK Constitution provides that international treaties ratified by the RoK (such as the RoK-NL Treaty) have priority over RoK domestic laws (including the RoK tax code) and RoK Supreme Court precedent provides that where an international treaty contains a mutual agreement procedure such as the MAP, for the good faith performance of the treaty such mutual agreement procedure, when invoked, should be conducted between the competent authorities of the two states party to the treaty to achieve the goals of such treaty. A treaty party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for a failure to perform its treaty obligations.\nAs previously announced, the Company believes that the tax claims made by the RoK tax authorities resulting from their tax audits of ZKM for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020, which deny ZKM the benefit of relevant and valid exemptions from, or reductions to, withholding tax payable under RoK law on certain bonds issued by Group companies, remuneration on an intra-Group loan, and income from consulting services, respectively, are without merit.\nThe Company continues to monitor developments closely and will continue to defend its interests and to assess all available legal and treaty-based remedies.\nFurther updates will be issued as appropriate.\nLEI: 2138007VWEP4MM3J8B29\nFurther information\nFor further information please visit\nwww.nostrumoilandgas.com\nFurther enquiries\nNostrum Oil & Gas PLC\nYelena Zhuravleva, CFO\nir@nog.co.uk\nTEAM LEWIS\nGalyna Kulachek\n+ 44 (0) 20 7802 2664\nnostrum@teamlewis.com\nAbout\u00a0Nostrum Oil & Gas\nNostrum Oil & Gas PLC\u00a0is an independent mixed-asset energy company with world-class gas processing facilities and export hub in north-west Kazakhstan.

The tax authorities have asserted withholding tax claims for such three year period totalling approximately USD 71 million (comprising USD 52 million relating to the 2018/2019 audits and USD 19 million in potential claims for 2020), which the Company believes contradict applicable laws and treaties and arbitral, administrative and judicial practice. Since commencement of operations in Kazakhstan in 1997, ZKM has paid in aggregate more than USD 1.24 billion in taxes, royalties and other payments to the RoK\n.\nOn 28 January 2026, ZKM was informed that the RoK Ministry of Finance Appeal Board has scheduled a hearing on 5 February 2026 to consider ZKM's appeals of the tax audits for 2018 and 2019, following the resumption of proceedings after a prior period of suspension. The Company expects that the Appeal Board will consider all relevant facts together with national and international laws, and take into account all relevant treaties, including the relevant double tax treaty between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and RoK, pursuant to which the Dutch tax authorities have initiated a mutual agreement procedure (\"\nMAP\n\") in respect of the pertinent claims. The outcome of the hearing remains uncertain and may result in further procedural steps in accordance with applicable laws rather than a final determination.\nThe scheduling of the hearing represents a further step in the progression of the dispute. The Company continues to monitor developments closely and to take appropriate steps to protect its interests.\nThe Company is incorporated under the laws of England and Wales and listed on the London Stock Exchange. Its investor base is international, with investors predominantly based in the United States. In addition, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary Nostrum Oil & Gas Finance BV, incorporated in the Netherlands, is the issuer of the Group's senior secured notes and senior unsecured notes.\nThe Company will continue to defend its interests and to assess all available legal remedies.\nFurther updates will be issued as appropriate.\nLEI: 2138007VWEP4MM3J8B29\nFurther information\nFor further information please visit\nwww.nostrumoilandgas.com\nFurther enquiries\nNostrum Oil & Gas PLC\nYelena Zhuravleva, CFO\nir@nog.co.uk\nTEAM LEWIS\nGalyna Kulachek\n+ 44 (0) 20 7802 2664\nnostrum@teamlewis.com\nAbout Nostrum Oil & Gas\nNostrum Oil & Gas PLC is an independent mixed-asset energy company with world-class gas processing facilities and export hub in north-west Kazakhstan.

This update is being issued in advance of the release of Nostrum's audited consolidated accounts for the same period. The financial information disclosed in this announcement is unaudited and remains subject to the completion of Nostrum's year-end external audit.\nViktor Gladun, Chief Executive Officer of Nostrum Oil & Gas, commented:\n\"Nostrum remains dedicated to driving strategic growth through strong leadership while upholding the highest standards of health and safety.\n2025 was a year of continued operational and strategic progress, achieved despite lower oil prices and natural decline at the mature Chinarevskoye Field. The business demonstrated resilience through reliable operations, disciplined capital management, and a 23.2% increase in average processed volumes, driven by the ramp\u2011up of third-party feedstock and stable plant performance. Together with the successful drilling and workover programme at Chinarevskoye, this resulted in higher titled production and sales volumes year-on-year. New well 116_1 was brought onstream at the end of November 2025 following the successful completion activities and is delivering production levels consistent with management's expectations.\nDuring the year, we advanced planning for the Stepnoy Leopard development options while ensuring alignment with project objectives and regulatory requirements.\nLooking ahead, Nostrum remains focused on maximising asset value, deepening strategic partnerships, restructuring debt maturing in June 2026, maintaining financial discipline, and delivering enduring benefits for shareholders, stakeholders and the people of Kazakhstan.\"\nFY 2025 Highlights:\nOperational\n\u00b7\nProduction and sales\n\u00a7\nA 23.2% increase in average processed volumes (including third party condensate tolling volumes) to 24,431 boepd in FY 2025 (FY 2024: 19,831 boepd). A 12.9% increase in average daily titled production volumes (i.e. final products processed and owned by Nostrum) to 16,867 boepd in FY 2025 (FY 2024: 14,935 boepd). These increases were achieved through continuing to process the ramping up feedstock from Ural Oil & Gas\u00a0LLP\u00a0(\"Ural O&G\"), and managing expected decline in Chinarevskoye production through well workovers.\n\u00a7\nThe titled production volume split was as follows:\nProducts\nFY 2025\nvolumes\n(boepd)\nFY 2024\nvolumes\n(boepd)\nY-on-Y\nChange\n(%)\nFY 2025\nproduct mix\n(%)\nFY 2024\nproduct mix\n(%)\nCrude Oil\n2,343\n2,536\n(7.6)%\n13.9%\n17.0%\nStabilised Condensate*\n1,664\n1,897\n(12.3)%\n9.9%\n12.7%\nLPG (Liquid Petroleum Gas)\n3,162\n2,537\n24.6%\n18.7%\n17.0%\nDry Gas\n9,698\n7,965\n21.8%\n57.5%\n53.3%\nTotal\n16,867\n14,935\n12.9%\n100.0%\n100.0%\n*Stabilised condensate volumes exclude Ural O&G processed volumes for which Nostrum receives a fixed tolling fee\n\u00a7\nA 16.2% increase in average daily sales volumes to 15,146 boepd in FY 2025 (FY 2024: 13,038 boepd), reflecting higher titled production. The difference between titled production and sales volumes is primarily due to the internal consumption of dry gas produced and timing of product deliveries, which may lead to inventory increases or decreases at period end.\n\u00b7\nChinarevskoye drilling and workover programme\nThe Company's Chinarevskoye limited-scale drilling programme for 2025 targeted most economic subsurface opportunities while also ensuring compliance with license obligations.\nOn 13 October 2025, the Company successfully completed drilling operations on the well 116_1. After completing perforation, stimulation and flowline tie-in, the well was put on production on 21 November 2025, achieving production rates in line with management's expectations. In parallel, during the year the Company continued to carry out optimised well workovers to minimise production decline and enhance operational efficiency.\nA comprehensive review and assessment of potential well workovers and new drilling prospects is underway.\n\u00b7\nStepnoy Leopard Fields\nA comprehensive review of the overall development strategy for the Stepnoy Leopard Fields is underway, taking into account key factors such as project economics, infrastructure access, sales delivery points, compliance with regulatory requirements and licence commitments.\n\u00b7\nProcessing of Ural O&G products\nThroughout FY 2025, the Company continued processing raw gas and condensate volumes from Ural O&G, resulting in the increases in titled production and processed volumes. As announced on 21 March 2025, the Company signed a new agreement with Ural O&G, extending third-party hydrocarbon processing terms through May 2031, strengthening cash flows, supporting efficient plant operations, and facilitating cost-effective development of the Rozhkovskoye field.\nFinancial\n\u00b7\nFY 2025 revenue is estimated to be approximately\u00a0US$118 million\u00a0(FY 2024:\u00a0US$137.1 million). The increase in titled production and processed volumes from Ural O&G feedstock and continued well workover had a positive impact on revenues. However, this was offset by a natural production decline at the Chinarevskoye field (approximately 21% decrease in production) and a 13.2% decrease in the average Brent crude oil price (US$70.0/bbl in FY 2025 vs US$80.6/bbl in FY 2024).\n\u00b7\nThe unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balance as at\u00a031 December 2025\u00a0was in excess of\u00a0US$143 million\u00a0(31 December 2024:\u00a0US$150.4 million). The restricted cash balance (debt service retention account (\"DSRA\") and asset liquidation fund)\u00a0was in excess of\u00a0US$26 million\u00a0as at\u00a031 December 2025\u00a0(31 December 2024:\u00a0US$25.9 million).\n\u00b7\nIn FY 2025, the Group generated a healthy net operating cashflow, before non-recurring items. After the limited capital expenditures on the Chinarevskoye and Stepnoy Leopard fields and one-off payments under the management incentive plan the Group's unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balance reduced by approximately\u00a0US$7 million during FY 2025.\n\u00b7\nThe Group remains focused on maximising facility uptime with the annual plant maintenance completed earlier than planned, controlling costs wherever possible, and improving efficiencies across all facets of business. At the same time, we are committed to allocating and utilising resources efficiently to support our growth projects.\nHSE and ESG\n\u00b7\nZero fatalities among employees and contractors during operations in 2025 (2024: zero).\n\u00b7\nTotal Recordable Incidents Rate (incidents per million man-hours) of 0.92 in 2025 (2024:0.63).\n\u00b7\nZero Lost Time Injury Rate (incidents per million man-hours) in 2025 (2024: zero).\n\u00b7\n4,048 tonnes of air emissions emitted in 2025 against 5,188 tonnes permitted for 2025 under the Kazakhstan Environmental Code.\n\u00b7\nSafety of all staff and contractors, along with a commitment to sustainable operations, remains the Group's priority.\n2026 production guidance\n\u200b\n2026 average daily production for the Chinarevskoye field is forecast at 5,000 - 6,000 boepd.\nRelease of Nostrum's 2025 Financial Results\n\u200b\nNostrum plans to release its annual report and audited financial statements in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2025\u00a0on\u00a0or around\u00a029 April 2026.\nLEI: 2138007VWEP4MM3J8B29\nFurther information\nFor further information please visit\nwww.nostrumoilandgas.com\nFurther enquiries\nNostrum Oil & Gas PLC\nElena Zhuravleva\nChief Financial Officer\nir@nog.co.uk\nTEAM LEWIS\nGalyna Kulachek\n+ 44 (0) 20 7802 2664\nnostrum@teamlewis.com\nNotifying person\nThomas Hartnett\nCompany Secretary\nAbout Nostrum Oil & Gas\nNostrum Oil & Gas PLC is an independent mixed-asset energy company with world-class gas processing facilities and export hub in north-west Kazakhstan.

I am pleased to welcome Robert Wynne to the Board of Directors as a Non-Executive Director, bringing extensive commercial experience and technical expertise in the oil and gas industry. During the first nine months of 2025, Nostrum demonstrated resilience and disciplined execution despite a challenging environment marked by weaker oil prices and the natural production decline of the mature Chinarevskoye field. We delivered an EBITDA of US$26.8 million, complemented by a 28% reduction in operating expenses per barrel processed, which reflects our improved processing efficiencies and growth in third-party volume processing. Additionally, we maintained a strong liquidity position, with net positive operating cash flow over the nine months of US$21.6 million before one-off items and unrestricted cash of US$147.3 million as of the period end. These results highlight the stability of our operations and the reliability of our infrastructure.\nLooking ahead, we remain deeply committed to create sustainable value for all our stakeholders and contributing positively to Kazakhstan's energy sector.\"\n9M 2025 Highlights:\nFinancial\n\u00b7\nRevenue of US$85.5 million (9M 2024: US$101.4 million). The increase in titled production and processed volumes from\nUral Oil & Gas LLP (\"Ural O&G\")\nfeedstock and continued well workovers had a positive impact on revenues. However, this was offset by natural production decline at the Chinarevskoye field and a 14% decrease in the average Brent crude oil price (US$70.95/bbl in 9M 2025 vs US$82.6/bbl in 9M 2024).\n\u00b7\nEBITDA1 of US$26.8 million (9M 2024: 34.7 million) and an EBITDA margin of 31.3% (9M 2024: 34.2%).\n\u00b7\nA 28% reduction in average operating expenses per barrel of processed volumes: US$4.7 during 9M 2025: (9M 2024: US$6.5).\n\u00b7\nThe Group's net positive operating cashflow was US$21.6 million, before one-off items. After limited capital expenditures on the Chinarevskoye and Stepnoy Leopard fields and one-off payments under the management incentive plan, the Group's unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balance reduced by US$3.1 million during 9M 2025.\n\u00b7\nThe unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balance of US$147.3 million as at 30 September 2025 (30 June 2025: US$135.9 million, 31 December 2024: US$150.4 million). The Group's restricted cash balance (debt service retention account (\"DSRA\") and asset liquidation fund) was US$26.3 million as at 30 September 2025 (30 June 2025: US$26.1 million, 31 December 2024: US$25.9 million).\n\u00b7\nNet debt2 of US$501.3 million as at 30 September 2025 (30 June 2025: US$473.1million, 31 December 2024: US$404.2 million). The Group's net debt mainly increased due to US$42.7\u202fmillion payment-in-kind interest capitalised on its Senior Unsecured Notes (SUNs),\nUS$14.2 million accrued cash interest\nand a US$50.1 million amortisation of the fair value adjustment. The increase was partially offset by the cancellation of US$5,628,000 Senior Secured Notes (SSNs) and US$9,629,836 SUNs in April 2025, pursuant to the terms of the holding period trust deed dated 9 February 2023.\n\u00b7\nWith respect to the US$8.3 million delayed SSN and SUN coupon payment, please refer to the Company's press releases dated 10 July, 22 July, 30 July, 2 September, 16 September, 24 September and 6 October 2025.\n\u00b7\nThe Group remains focused on maximising facility uptime with the annual plant maintenance completed earlier than planned, controlling costs wherever possible, and improving efficiencies across all facets of the business. At the same time, we are committed to allocating and utilising resources efficiently to support our growth projects.\nOperational\n\u00b7\nProduction and sales\n\u00b7\nA 33% increase in average processed volumes (including third party condensate tolling volumes) to 23,596 boepd in 9M 2025 (9M 2024: 17,748 boepd). An 18.5% increase in average daily titled production volumes (i.e. final products processed and owned by Nostrum) to 16,300 boepd in 9M 2025 (9M 2024: 13,758 boepd).

In this context, I am pleased to welcome Nikolay Ivin as the new Chairman of the Board, bringing extensive corporate finance experience across emerging markets, and James Hart as an independent non-executive director.\nDuring the first nine months of 2025, Nostrum delivered strong operational results despite a challenging environment marked by lower oil prices and the natural decline of our mature Chinarevskoye field. Total processed volumes during the first three quarters increased by 33% compared to the same period of 2024, which was mainly driven by the ramp\n\u2011\nup of third-party feedstock. These results underscore our reliability and efficiency both as an operator and a business partner.\nWe are continuing a thorough analysis of various development scenarios of our Stepnoy Leopard asset, while advancing a well-structured workover and drilling programme at the Chinarevskoye field in line with our licence obligations. Alongside our continued focus on cost efficiency and disciplined capital deployment, these initiatives aim to create sustainable, long-term value for our shareholders, stakeholders, and the people of Kazakhstan.\"\n9M 2025 Highlights:\nOperational\n\u00b7\nProduction and sales\n\u00b7\nA 33% increase in average processed volumes (including third party condensate tolling volumes) to 23,596 boepd in 9M 2025 (9M 2024: 17,748 boepd). An 18.5% increase in average daily titled production volumes (i.e. final products processed and owned by Nostrum) to 16,300 boepd in 9M 2025 (9M 2024: 13,758 boepd). These increases were achieved through continuing to process the ramping up feedstock from Ural Oil & Gas\u00a0LLP\u00a0(\"Ural O&G\"), and managing expected decline in Chinarevskoye production through well workovers.\n\u00b7\nThe titled production volume split was as follows:\nProducts\n9M 2025\nvolumes\n(boepd)\n9M 2024\nvolumes\n(boepd)\nY-on-Y\nChange\n(%)\n9M 2025\nproduct mix\n(%)\n9M 2024\nproduct mix\n(%)\nCrude Oil\n2,403\n2,500\n(3.9)%\n14.7%\n18.2%\nStabilised Condensate*\n1,559\n1,824\n(14.5)%\n9.6%\n13.3%\nLPG (Liquid Petroleum Gas)\n3,038\n2,335\n30.1%\n18.6%\n17.0%\nDry Gas\n9,300\n7,099\n31.0%\n57.1%\n51.5%\nTotal\n16,300\n13,758\n18.5%\n100.0%\n100.0%\n*Stabilised condensate volumes exclude Ural O&G processed volumes for which Nostrum receives a fixed tolling fee\n\u00b7\nA 19.9% increase in average daily sales volumes to 14,339 boepd in 9M 2025 (9M 2024: 11,956 boepd), reflecting the increase in titled production. The difference between titled production and sales volumes is primarily due to the internal consumption of dry gas produced and timing of product deliveries, which may lead to inventory increases or decreases at period end.\n\u00b7\nChinarevskoye drilling and workover programme\nThe Company's Chinarevskoye limited-scale drilling programme for 2025 targets most economic subsurface opportunities while also ensuring compliance with license obligations. On 13 October 2025, the Company successfully completed drilling operations on the well No.116_1, which is followed by well completion and testing over the following four to six weeks. In parallel, the Company continues to carry out optimised well workovers to minimise production decline and enhance operational efficiency.\n\u00b7\nStepnoy Leopard Fields\nIn April 2025, the Company received formal approval from Kazakhstan's Ministry of Energy for a phased Full-Field Development Plan (FDP) for the Stepnoy Leopard Fields. The Company is actively progressing with detailed design and engineering activities, alongside selective procurement, to ensure compliance with license commitments. Key development projects, including the pipeline to Chinarevskoye and the sour gas treatment infrastructure, are currently undergoing rigorous review to ensure alignment with project objectives and regulatory requirements.\n\u00b7\nProcessing of Ural O&G products\nThroughout 9M 2025, the Company continued processing raw gas and condensate volumes from Ural O&G, resulting in the increases in titled production and processed volumes. On 8 October 2025, processing volumes from Ural Oil & Gas achieved a record high. As announced on 21 March 2025, the Company signed a new agreement with U",

A 65% increase in processed volumes with maximum facilities uptime showcase that Nostrum is a reliable business partner and well-positioned to become a major gas processor in the region.\nOn our upstream business, we have launched our 2025 limited-scale drilling programme for the Chinarevskoye field along with well workover and intervention works, and we continue to carefully assess Stepnoy Leopard development options, with a view to ensure compliance with license requirements and achieve the most favorable outcomes from both of these fields.\nLooking forward, we are strongly committed to keeping health and safety as our top priority, and to striving to deliver value to all our stakeholders and the benefit of\u00a0Kazakhstan.\"\nH1 2025 Highlights:\nFinancial\n\u00b7\nH1 2025 revenue of US$64.1 million\u00a0(H1 2024:\u00a0US$65.3 million). Increases in titled production and processed volumes from Ural Oil & Gas LLP (\"Ural O&G\") feedstock and Chinarevskoye well workovers were offset by the natural decline in Chinarevskoye field production and a 16% average Brent crude oil price reduction (H1 2025 US$71.92/bbl vs H1 2024 US$83.70/bbl).\n\u00b7\nH1 2025 EBITDA1 of US$22.4 million and EBITDA margin of 35.0% (H1 2024 US$22.3 million and 34.2%, respectively).\n\u00b7\nA 41% reduction in operating expenses per barrel of processed volumes: H1 2025 US$4.4 (H1 2024 US$7.6).\n\u00b7\nH1 2025 Group positive net operating cashflows of US$6.2 million before one-off items (H1 2024 US$4.2 million), which was adversely impacted by a high level of sales receivables due to the timing of shipments of crude oil and condensate. After one-off payments of US$15.5 million under the management incentive plan (including associated social security payments), and limited capital expenditures on the Chinarevskoye and Stepnoy Leopard Fields the Group's unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balance reduced by US$14.5 million during H1 2025.\n\u00b7\nUnrestricted cash balance\u00a0of US$135.9 million as at\u00a030 June 2025\u00a0(31 March 2025:\u00a0US$148.6 million, 31 December 2024:\u00a0US$150.4 million). The Group's restricted cash balance (debt service retention account (\"DSRA\") and asset liquidation fund)\u00a0was US$26.1 million\u00a0as at\u00a030 June 2025\u00a0(31 December 2024:\u00a0US$25.9 million, 31 March 2025:\u00a0US$26.2 million).\n\u00b7\nNet debt2 of US$473.1 million as at 30 June 2025 (31 March 2025:\u00a0US$440.2 million, 31 December 2024: US$404.2 million). The Group's net debt increased due to US$27.9\u202fmillion of interest capitalised on SUNs, a US$33.8 million amortisation of the fair value adjustment, US$8.3 million delayed SSN and SUN coupon payment, and a net US$14.5 million reduction in unrestricted cash balance. The increase was partially offset by the cancellation of US$5,628,000 outstanding Senior Secured Notes (SSNs) and US$9,629,836 Senior Unsecured Notes (SUNs) in April 2025, pursuant to\nthe terms of the holding period trust deed dated 9 February 2023.\n\u00b7\nWith respect to the US$8.3 million delayed SSN and SUN coupon payment, please refer to the Company's press releases dated 10 July, 22 July and 30 July 2025.\n\u00b7\nThe Group remains focused on maximising facility uptime, controlling costs wherever possible, and improving efficiencies across all facets of business.

This was achieved through continuing the ramp-up in third-party volumes processed at our facilities with maximum uptime, as well as active well workover and intervention works to maintain production levels.\nWe will continue to carefully assess our options of developing and monetising our Stepnoy Leopard assets, and endeavor that the most optimal well workover and drilling campaign is executed at the Chinarvskoye field, while ensuring compliance with license requirements. These efforts together with tight cost displine and prudent capital allocation are all aimed at generating long-term value for our shareholders, stakeholders and the benefit of Kazakhstan.\"\nH1 2025 Highlights:\nOperational\n\u00b7\nProduction and sales\no\nA 39% increase in average daily titled production volumes (i.e. final products processed and owned by Nostrum) to 16,974 boepd in H1 2025 (H1 2024: 12,220 boepd). A 65% increase in total processed volumes (including third party condensate tolling volumes) to 24,619 boepd in H1 2025 (H1 2024: 14,919 boepd). Whilst production from the maturing Chinarveskoye field continues to decline, Nostrum's titled production and processed volumes increased due to:\no\nContinuing ramp up of production by\u00a0Ural Oil & Gas\u00a0LLP\u00a0(\"Ural O&G\").\no\nProduction from well No.301 which was completed and put into production in\u00a0May 2024.\n\u00b7\nThe titled production volume split was as follows:\nProducts\nH1 2025\nvolumes\n(boepd)\nH1 2024\nvolumes\n(boepd)\nY-on-Y\nChange\n(%)\nH1 2025\nproduct mix\n(%)\nH1 2024\nproduct mix\n(%)\nCrude Oil\n2,476\n2,393\n3.5%\n14.6%\n19.6%\nStabilised Condensate*\n1,598\n1,850\n(13.6)%\n9.4%\n15.1%\nLPG (Liquid Petroleum Gas)\n3,165\n1,983\n59.6%\n18.6%\n16.2%\nDry Gas\n9,735\n5,994\n62.4%\n57.4%\n49.1%\nTotal\n16,974\n12,220\n38.9%\n100.0%\n100.0%\n*Stabilised condensate volumes exclude Ural O&G processed volumes for which Nostrum receives a fixed tolling fee\n\u00b7\nA 49% increase in average daily sales volumes to 15,555 boepd in H1 2025 (H1 2024: 10,475 boepd), reflecting the increase in titled production and inventory movements. The difference between titled production and sales volumes is primarily due to the internal consumption of dry gas produced and timing of product deliveries, which leads to inventory increases or decreases at period end.\n\u00b7\nChinarevskoye drilling programme\nThe Company is planning a limited-scale drilling campaign beginning in\u00a0mid-August. The campaign will target the most economic subsurface opportunities while also ensuring compliance with license obligations. In parallel, the Company\u00a0continues to carry out optimised well workovers to minimise production decline.\n\u00b7\nStepnoy Leopard Fields\nIn April 2025, the Company secured approval from Kazakhstan's Ministry of Energy for a phased full-field development plan (FDP) for the Stepnoy Leopard fields, which marks a key milestone in advancing the commercial potential of the upstream asset, enabling optimized capital deployment. As part of the ongoing progress, the Company continues to advance design and engineering works, and limited procurement to ensure compliance with license commitments.\n\u00b7\nProcessing of Ural O&G products\nThroughout\nH\n1 2025, the Company continued processing raw gas and condensate volumes from Ural O&G, resulting in the increases in titled production and processed volumes. As announced on 21 March 2025, the Group signed reduced tolling fee agreement with Ural O&G to extend third-party hydrocarbon processing terms until May 2031, strengthening cash flows, supporting efficient plant operations, and facilitating cost-effective development of the Rozhkovskoye field.\nFinancial\n\u00b7\nH1 2025 revenue is estimated to be approximately\u00a0US$64 million\u00a0(H1 2024:\u00a0US$65.3 million). The increase in titled production and processed volumes from Ural O&G feedstock and a continued well workover had a positive impact on revenues.

In order to facilitate a positive outcome for holders of the Notes, the Parent intends to seek applicable regulatory licenses and in the meantime the Issuer intends to launch a consent solicitation in relation to the Notes primarily to:\n(i) Permit payments of interest on the Notes outside of the clearing systems, to the extent this can be implemented under applicable laws;\n(ii) Waive any default or event of default that may have occurred or may occur due to the delayed payment of interest on the Notes.\nAny consent solicitation will be proposed to holders of the Notes by way of electronic consent and at a noteholder meeting and, if approved, authorised by an extraordinary resolution of each series of Notes.\nAs the above authorisations relating to the Notes are \"Reserved Matters\", this requires either approval by 75% in principal amount of the Notes and/or by 75% of those attending at a quorate meeting (each series voting separately) with the requisite quorum for passing Reserved Matters.\nTiming\nIt is expected that any regulatory license application and approval would take a number of weeks and the relevant approval would be at the discretion of relevant authorities.\nThe Issuer intends to launch a noteholder meeting as soon as practicable, with notice being required for at least 21 days for an initial meeting, and a subsequent 7 days for an adjourned meeting. This may be shortened to the extent 75% in principal amount of the Notes (each series voting separately) approve the terms of the extraordinary resolution relating to each series of Notes.\nThe Parent thanks holders of the Notes for their support and understanding as it seeks to proactively resolve these third party issues that are delaying the interest payment due on the Notes.\nLEI: 2138007VWEP4MM3J8B29\nFurther information\nFor further information please visit\nwww.nostrumoilandgas.com\nFurther enquiries:\nNostrum Oil & Gas PLC\nThomas Hartnett - Chief Legal Officer / Company Secretary\nir@nog.co.uk\nInstinctif Partners - UK\nGalyna Kulachek\n+ 44 (0) 207 457 2020\nnostrum@instinctif.com\nNotifying person\nThomas Hartnett\nCompany Secretary\nAbout Nostrum Oil & Gas\nNostrum Oil & Gas PLC is an independent mixed-asset energy company with world-class gas processing facilities and export hub in north-west Kazakhstan.

In doing so, and in parallel with the ongoing discussions between its stakeholders mentioned above and the results of the Annual General Meeting of the Company held today, the Company announces the following changes to its governance arrangements:\n\u00b7\nArfan Khan has stepped down from the board with effect from\nthe close of the AGM\nand will cease his role as chief executive officer with effect on 30 June\n\u00b7\nChris Hopkinson, an independent non-executive director, has stepped down from the board with effect from the close of the AGM\n\u00b7\nIt is proposed that Viktor Gladun (in addition to remaining as a director of the Company) be appointed as chief executive officer with effect as soon as reasonably practicable\nStephen Whyte remains the Company's chair and Martin Gudgeon and Fiona Paulus also continue as directors of the Company.\nThese governance changes will allow for additional appointments to the board to occur on an accelerated basis and any announcements in that regard will be made by the Company as and when appropriate.\nThe changes to the Board have received relevant consent in accordance with the requirements of the warrant instrument constituting the share warrants dated 9 February 2023 such that no right to exercise the warrants shall arise following these changes to the Board. The Company proposes to re-constitute the composition of the relevant committees of the Board following additional appointments of directors (so as to comply with the relevant provisions of the warrant instrument).\nStephen Whyte said:\n\"\nI would like to thank Arfan and Chris for their tremendous contributions to the Company. In particular, Arfan has played a key role in the transformation of Nostrum into a multi-asset (multiple oil-fields) and mixed-asset (upstream-midstream) business.\nEven after the completion of the major financial restructuring in early 2023, the Company's business faced significant challenges due to its negative topline revenue growth; with significant debt on the books with a rapidly approaching maturity and no prospects of any extensions of the Chinarevskoye license to operate. Since then Arfan and his team have secured almost 150 million barrels of undeveloped proven reserves (Stepnoy Leopard) located circa 100 km away, extended the UOG gas processing agreement to 2031 (that was incrementally value accretive and under a fixed fee-structure provides an effective hedge against commodity price risks) and implemented a cost-effective field rejuvenation campaign for Chinarevskoye which has been effective in starting the turnaround of the business.\nThe Company is now in the midst of implementing a transformative phase of its life cycle, as it plans to develop a midstream business that will construct and operate the infrastructure to enable the commercial development of the Stepnoy Leopard field along with opening up the transportation business / corridor to the larger number of stranded gas fields in the vicinity. We look forward to the continuing positive development of Nostrum under the new leadership of Viktor Gladun.\"\nLEI: 2138007VWEP4MM3J8B29\nFurther information\nFor further information please visit\nwww.nog.co.uk\nFurther enquiries\nNostrum Oil & Gas PLC\nPetro Mychalkiw, CFO\nir@nog.co.uk\nInstinctif Partners - UK\nGalyna Kulachek\n+ 44 (0) 207 457 2020\nnostrum@instinctif.com\nNotifying person\nThomas Hartnett\nCompany Secretary\nAbout Nostrum Oil & Gas\nNostrum Oil & Gas PLC is an independent mixed-asset energy company with world-class gas processing facilities and e",

In Q1 2025, we delivered a 41% increase in average daily titled production year-over-year and total processed volumes increased by 68% to 24,009 boepd. These increases were driven by the ramp-up of\nUral Oil & Gas\u00a0LLP (\"Ural O&G\") production through 2024 and new production from Chinarevskoye well No.301 from May 2024.\nWe achieved a key milestone with the approval of the phased full-field development plan for the Stepnoy Leopard fields, targeting production start-up between late 2026 and early 2027. The extension of our processing agreement with Ural O&G through to May 2031 further secures the long-term value.\"\nQ1 2025 Highlights:\nFinancial\n\u00b7\nRevenue of US$30.0 million (Q1 2024: US$31.8 million). The increase in titled production and processed volumes from Ural O&G feedstock as well as production from well No. 301 had a positive impact on revenues, off-setting the impact of the declining base production. However, revenue in Q1 2025 was reduced by a temporary crude oil inventory build-up at the end of the quarter, which was subsequently sold in May 2025. The average Brent crude oil price decreased to US$75.9/bbl in Q1 2025 (Q1 2024: US$82.9/bbl).\n\u00b7\nA 2.8% increase in EBITDA1: US$10.9 million for Q1 2025 (Q1 2024: US$10.6 million) and an improved EBITDA margin of 36.3% (Q1 2024: 33.3%).\n\u00b7\nA 39.5% reduction in operating expenses per barrel of processed volumes: US$4.6 in Q1 2025 (Q1 2024: US$7.6).\n\u00b7\nNet operating cashflow in Q1 2025 was affected by the deferment of crude oil sales, as described above. This, together with capital expenditures, resulted in a US$1.8 million reduction in the Group's unrestricted cash balance by the end of Q1 2025.\n\u00b7\nUnrestricted cash balance of US$148.6 million as at 31 March 2025 (31 December 2024: US$150.4 million). The Group's restricted cash balance (\ndebt service retention account (\"DSRA\") and asset liquidation fund)\nwas US$26.2 million as at 31 March 2025 (31 December 2024: US$25.9 million).\n\u00b7\nNet debt2 of US$440.2 million as at 31 March 2025 (31 December 2024: US$404.2 million). The Group's net debt increased due to US$18.4 million accrued bond interest, a US$16.0 million fair value adjustment amortisation expense and a net US$1.6 million reduction in unrestricted cash and DSRA balances.\nOperational\n\u00b7\nProduction and sales\n\u00b7\nA 41% increase in average daily titled production volumes (i.e. final products processed and owned by Nostrum) to 16,830 boepd in Q1 2025 (11,943 boepd in Q1 2024). A 68% increase in total processed volumes (including third party condensate tolling volumes) to 24,009 boepd in Q1 2025 (14,319 boepd in Q1 2024). These increases in titled production and processed volumes were mainly due to\n:\n\u00b7\nRamp up of the production by Ural O&G, which contributed to increase in Nostrum's titled production and processed volumes.\n\u00b7\nProduction from well No.301 which was completed and put into production in\u00a0May 2024.\n\u00b7\nThe titled production volume split was as follows:\nProducts\nQ1 2025 volumes (boepd)\nQ1 2024 volumes (boepd)\nY-on-Y change (%)\nQ1 2025\nproduct mix\n(%)\nQ1 2024\nproduct mix\n(%)\nCrude Oil\n2,650\n2,382\n11.3%\n15.7%\n19.9%\nStabilised Condensate*\n1,678\n1,934\n(13.2)%\n10.0%\n16.2%\nLPG (Liquid Petroleum Gas)\n3,077\n1,858\n65.6%\n18.3%\n15.6%\nDry Gas\n9,425\n5,769\n63.4%\n56.0%\n48.3%\nTotal\n16,830\n11,943\n40.9%\n100.0%\n100.0%\n*Stabilized condensate volumes exclude Ural O&G processed volumes for which Nostrum receives a tolling fee\n\u00b7\nA 47% increase in average daily sales volumes to 14,128 boepd for Q1 2025 (Q1 2024: 10,022 boepd). The difference between titled production and sales volumes is primarily due to the internal consumption of dry gas produced and timing of product deliveries, which leads to inventory increases or decreases at period end.\n\u00b7\nChinarevskoye drilling programme\nThe Company is planning a limited-scale drilling campaign in the second half of 2025, focused on high-value subsurface opportunities, which will also ensure full compliance with its license commitments.\n\u00b7\nStepnoy Leopard Fields\nThe Company achieved another significant milestone in unlocking the commercial viability and potential of this upstream acquisition.\nAs announced on 4 April 2025, the Company obtained ap",

The Company continues to progress design and engineering works.\n\u00b7\nProcessing of Ural O&G products\nThroughout Q1 2025, the Company continued processing raw gas and condensate volumes from Ural O&G, significantly contributing to the increases in titled production and processed volumes.\nAs announced on 21 March 2025, the Group entered into a binding agreement with Ural O&G on new terms for processing third-party hydrocarbons until May 2031. The agreement extension is value-accretive and mutually beneficial for both parties. It provides a fixed processing fee structure across all products that gives rise to sustainable cash-flows and plant operations and supports the further cost-effective development of the Rozhkovskoye field.\nFinancial\n\u00b7\nQ1 2025 revenue is estimated to be approximately US$30 million (Q1 2024: US$31.7 million). The increase in titled production and processed volumes from Ural O&G feedstock as well as production from well No. 301 had a positive impact to revenues. However, sales and revenues in Q1 2025 were reduced by a temporary crude oil inventory build-up at the end of the quarter; this product volume will be sold in Q2 2025. The average Brent crude oil price decreased to US$75.9/bbl in Q1 2025 (Q1 2024: US$82.9/bbl).\n\u00b7\nThe unrestricted cash and cash equivalents balance as at 31 March 2025 was in excess of US$148 million (31 December 2024: US$150.4 million).

Anyone wishing to participate in this call should register using the following link:\nResults Call\n.\nArfan Khan, Chief Executive Officer of Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC, commented:\n\"In 2024 and early 2025, we continued driving value realisation by executing our mixed-asset energy strategy, achieving key milestones in upstream production growth, infrastructure utilisation, and financial stability. Key achievements included the successful ramp-up of raw gas feedstock from Ural Oil & Gas LLP (\"Ural O&G\"), additional production from our limited-scale Chinarevskoye drilling programme, as well as continuing production benefits from our 2023 gas lift expansion project at our Chinarevskoye field. Our operations delivered a 48% year-over-year increase in titled production volumes and nearly doubled our processed volumes, with processing facility availability averaging approximately 98% for the year.\nOur financial performance was equally robust, with significant revenue and EBITDA growth and reduced operating expenses per barrel, reflecting enhanced processing efficiencies and disciplined cost management. We also maintained a strong liquidity position with net positive operating cashflows of US$33.1 million and unrestricted cash at year end of US$150.4 million (unrestricted cash at year end of\nUS$178.1 million before one-off cashflow items).\nThe Stepnoy Leopard fields represent a transformative growth opportunity for Nostrum. In 2024, we reached a final investment decision for the first phase of the field's development, followed by an independent Competent Person's Report validating the commercial viability of a scalable full-field development plan, and in April 2025 the Ministry of Energy of the Republic of Kazakhstan approved a phased, full-field development plan which enables us to allocate capital efficiently while staying on track to achieve our target production start-up date between late 2026 and early 2027.\nIn\nMarch 2025, the Group extended its agreement with Ural O&G on new terms for processing third-party hydrocarbons until May 2031. The agreement extension is value-accretive and mutually beneficial for both parties. It provides for a fixed process fee structure across all the products that gives rise to sustainable cash-flows and plant operations.

This update is being issued in advance of the release of Nostrum's audited consolidated accounts for the same period. All financial information disclosed remains draft subject to the finalization of Nostrum's year-end external audit.\nArfan Khan, Chief Executive Officer of Nostrum Oil & Gas, commented:\n\"I am pleased to share the Group's key operational results for the full-year 2024, reflecting the\ncontinued progress in delivering of our mixed-asset energy strategy, whilst maintaining strong operational and financial discipline.\nWe have been able to increase topline revenues by over 14% year-on-year despite the production decline from our mature Chinarevskoye field. We generated healthier operating cash inflows and further underpinned our cash reserves notwithstanding capital expenditures on growth activities such as Chinarevskoye drilling and Stepnoy Leopard field development. Nostrum almost doubled its total processed volumes year-on-year, thanks to the operational excellence in handling and processing of raw gas from Ural O&G, new production from well No.301, enhancements to our facilities including the doubling of the Gaslift capacity and the restart of our state-of-the-art 2.5 bcma GTU-3.\nWe remain committed to\ndriving sustainable growth and\ndelivering on our strategic objectives that maximize value for our investors, and we look forward to delivering our final audited full year results in April 2025.\"\nFY 2024 Highlights:\nOperational\n\u00b7\nProduction and sales\n\u00b7\nA 48% increase in average\ndaily title production volumes (i.e. final products owned by Nostrum)\nto\n14,935 boepd\nin 2024 (10,091\nboepd\nin 2023). A 97% increase in total processed volumes (including third party condensate tolling volumes) in 2024, compared to 2023. These increases in production and processed volumes were mainly due to:\no\nProcessing of raw gas received from Ural Oil & Gas\nLLP (\"\nUral O&G\"\n)\n, commencing from December 2023;\no\nProduction from well No.301 which was completed and put into production in May 2024;\no\nFull year contribution from:\no\nGas-lift system expansion, which was successfully launched in July 2023 doubling its capacity and continued to perform above management expectations;\no\nAdditional 26% LPG yield from GTU-3, which has been in operation since September 2023.\n\u00b7\nThe title production volume split was as follows:\nProducts\n2024\nvolumes\n(boepd)\n2023\nvolumes\n(boepd)\nY-on-Y change\n(%)\n2024\nproduct mix\n(%)\n2023\nproduct mix\n(%)\nCrude Oil\n2,536\n2,649\n(4.3)%\n17.0%\n26.3%\nStabilised Condensate*\n1,897\n1,979\n(4.1)%\n12.7%\n19.6%\nLPG (Liquid Petroleum Gas)\n2,537\n1,291\n96.5%\n17.0%\n12.8%\nDry Gas\n7,965\n4,172\n90.9%\n53.3%\n41.3%\nTotal\n14,935\n10,091\n48.0%\n100.0%\n100.0%\n*Stabilised condensate volumes exclude Ural O&G processed volumes for which Nostrum receives a tolling fee\n\u00b7\nA 47% increase in average daily sales volumes to 13,038 boepd in 2024 (\n8,874\nboepd in 2023). The difference between production and sales volumes is primarily due to the internal consumption of dry gas produced and timing of product deliveries, which leads to inventory increases or decreases at period end\n.\n\u00b7\nChinarevskoye drilling programme\nMost of the scope planned under the drilling programme was executed on time and within budget in 2024. As previously reported the well No.301 has been producing since end of May 2024 in line with the management's expectations. The well was perforated in the lowest of the reservoirs with the plan underway to perforate the Tournasian reservoir in early 2025. Well No.41 appraisal sidetrack work carried a significant level of uncertainty and risk due to the multiple exploration, appraisal, and development objectives. The well was completed in September 2024 and a first test provided non-commercial inflow rates in the Devonian target horizon. Evaluation of other perforation targets is underway.\n\u00b7\nStepnoy Leopard Fields\nSeveral key milestones were achieved in relation to the Stepnoy Leopard Fields in 2024. In early 2024, successful completion of the two-well appraisal programme supported the final investment decision for the initial development phase. This was followed by the Competent Person's Report in July 2024, confirming 138 mmboe (including approximately 25% liquids) proved plus probable (2P) gross reserve",

These achievements are particularly notable given the ongoing production decline at our mature Chinarevskoye field and highlight the success of the Company's strategy to improve the utilisation of its world-class facilities by processing third-party hydrocarbons.\nWe continue to advance our upstream activities at the Stepnoy Leopard Fields and are completing the drilling of the second well at the Chinarevskoye field.\nAs always, health and safety remain our priority, as we focus on operational excellence and continue managing our liquidity to maximise value for all our investors and stakeholders.\"\n9M 2024 Highlights:\nFinancial\n\u00b7\n14% increase in revenue: US$101.4 million for 9M 2024 (9M 2023 US$88.8 million), resulting from increased processing, production and sales volumes. Brent crude oil price increased to an average of US$82.6/bbl for 9M 2024 (9M 2023 average of US$81.9/bbl).\n\u00b7\n5% increase in EBITDA1: US$34.7 million for 9M 2024 (9M 2023 US$33.0 million) and an EBITDA margin of 34.2% (9M 2023 37.1%).

However, capital expenditures on the Chinarevskoye drilling programme and Stepnoy Leopard appraisal works, as well as the semi-annual bond coupon payment in June 2024, led to a US$6.5 million reduction in the Group's unrestricted cash balance during 9M 2024.\n\u00b7\nThe Group continues to focus on maximising facility uptime, controlling costs and improving efficiencies across all facets of our business, while allocating and efficiently leveraging existing resources on growth projects.\nOperational\n\u00b7\nProduction and sales\n\u00b7\nAverage daily production increased by 34% to 13,758 boepd (9M 2023 10,288\u00a0boepd), and the total processed volumes (including condensate tolling volumes) increased by over 70% compared to 9M 2023. The increases in processed and production volumes were mainly due to:\no\nAdditional product volumes from processing raw gas received from\nUral O&G\n;\no\nProduction from well No.301 commencing the end of May 2024;\no\nGas-lift system expansion continues to perform above management expectations.

It was successfully launched in\u00a0July 2023 doubling its capacity and continues to help to slow down the production decline from the maturing Chinarevskoye field;\no\nContinuing operation of GTU-3 yielding additional 20% LPG owing to its cutting-edge turbo- expander technology.\n\u00b7\nThe title production volume split for 9M 2024 was as follows:\nProducts\n9M 2024\nvolumes\n(boepd)\n9M 2023\nvolumes\n(boepd)\nY-on-Y change\n(%)\n9M 2024\nproduct mix\n(%)\n9M 2023\nproduct mix\n(%)\nCrude Oil\n2,500\n2,727\n(8.3)%\n18.2%\n30.0%\nStabilised Condensate*\n1,824\n1,982\n(8.0)%\n13.3%\n21.6%\nLPG (Liquid Petroleum Gas)\n2,335\n1,293\n80.6%\n17.0%\n14.6%\nDry Gas\n7,099\n4,286\n65.6%\n51.5%\n33.8%\nTotal\n13,758\n10,288\n33.7%\n100.0%\n100.0%\n*Stabilised condensate volumes exclude Ural O&G processed volumes for which Nostrum receives a tolling fee\n\u00b7\nDaily sales volumes averaged 11,956 boepd for 9M 2024 (9M 2023\n: 9,096\nboepd).

The well targeted multiple in-fill zones across the Carboniferous and Devonian reservoirs and encountered hydrocarbons (oil, gas-condensate) in all three key intervals reaching a total depth of 4,980 meters. The well was perforated in the lowest of these reservoirs with the\nplan to perforate the Tournasian reservoir in early 2025.\nWell No.41 appraisal sidetrack work, which carried a significant level of uncertainty and risk as the subsurface targets contained multiple exploration, appraisal, and development objectives, was completed in September 2024. It did not encounter the primary Devonian target horizon. However, it discovered a new Devonian hydrocarbon-bearing horizon which is planned to be perforated in Q4 2024.\n\u00b7\nStepnoy Leopard Fields\nFollowing the\nfinal investment decision for the initial development phase of the Stepnoy Leopard Fields in early 2024, in\u00a0July 2024 Nostrum released the\nCompetent Person's Report ",

If you would like to participate in this call, please register by following the instructions provided in this link:\nResults Call\nArfan Khan, Chief Executive Officer of Nostrum Oil & Gas, commented:\n\"I am pleased to share the Group's results for H1 2024. We delivered solid operational and financial performance during this period, while also reaching key milestones that are strategically important for the Company's transformation into a mixed-asset energy company.\nAn increase of 44% in EBITDA for the first half of 2024, compared to the same period last year, along with a net positive operating cash flow during this period, highlights the successful initial results of the Company's new strategy, which includes processing third-party hydrocarbons from neighbouring\nUral Oil & Gas LLP\n.\nIn April we announced our final investment decision for the initial development phase of the Stepnoy Leopard Fields, followed by the release of the Stepnoy Leopard Competent Person's Report in July, which added 110 mmboe net to Nostrum's 2P reserves base, at an estimated NPV10 of approximately US$220 million.\nAs always, health and safety remain our priority, as we focus on operational excellence and continue managing our liquidity to maximise value for all our investors and stakeholders.\"\nH1 2024 Highlights:\nFinancial\n\u00b7\nRevenues of US$65.3 million, a 23.7% increase compared to US$52.8 million in H1 2023, resulting from additional sales volumes of dry gas and LPG produced from Ural Oil & Gas LLP (\"Ural O&G\") and US$3.9 million of condensate tolling revenue. Brent crude oil price increased from an average of US$79.7/bbl in H1 2023 to an average of US$83.7/bbl in H1 2024.\n\u00b7\n44% increase in EBITDA1 of US$22.3m (H1 2023: US$15.5m) with EBITDA margin of 34.2% (H1 2023: 29.4%). The increase is primarily driven by increased production and revenues as well as prudent cost management.\n\u00b7\nThe Group's unrestricted cash balance as at 30 June 2024 was US$142.5 million, including current investments in fixed term deposits and liquid money market funds. Excluding one-off items, our closing unrestricted cash position at the end of June would have been US$158.4m, a slight decrease from the 2023 year-end cash balance of US$161.7m.\n\u00b7\nThe restricted cash balance (DSRA and asset liquidation fund) was US$25.5 million as at 30 June 2024 (31 March 2024: US$25.2 million).\n\u00b7\nThe Group continues to focus on maximising facility uptime, controlling costs and improving efficiencies across all facets of our business, while allocating and efficiently utilising existing resources on growth projects.\n\u200b\nOperational\n\u00b7\nProduction and sales\n\u00b7\nDaily production averaged 12,220 boepd (H1 2023\n: 10,048\nboepd), a 22% increase driven by:\no\nAdditional volumes of dry gas and LPG produced from processing raw gas received from\nUral O&G\nat Nostrum's gas processing facilities.\no\nSuccessful launch of the gas-lift system expansion in\u00a0July 2023, which doubled its capacity and helped to slow down the production decline from the maturing Chinarevskoye field.\no\nAdditional LPG production from GTU-3 owing to improved yield by around 20%.\n\u00b7\nThe production volume split for H1 2024 was as follows:\nProducts\nH1 2024\nvolumes\n(boepd)\nH1 2024\nproduct mix\n(%)\nH1 2023\nvolumes\n(boepd)\nH1 2023\nproduct mix\n(%)\nCrude Oil\n2,393\n19.6%\n2,723\n27.1%\nStabilised Condensate*\n1,850\n15.1%\n1,898\n18.9%\nLPG (Liquid Petroleum Gas)\n1,983\n16.2%\n1,258\n12.5%\nDry Gas\n5,994\n49.1%\n4,169\n41.5%\nTotal\n12,220\n100.0%\n10,048\n100.0%\n*Stabilised condensate volumes exclude Ural O&G processed volumes for which Nostrum receives a tolling fee\n\u00b7\nDaily sales volumes averaged 10,475 boepd for H1 2024 (H1 2023\n: 9,020\nboepd).

We are also pleased to see approximately $21 million EBITDA estimated for the first half of the year, approximately 35% improvement compared to H1 2023, and net positive operating cashflows in H1 2024.\nWe also progressed our strategic initiatives\nby making a final investment decision for the initial development phase of the Stepnoy Leopard Fields (\"SL Fields\") in March 2024, followed by the release of a full Competent Person's Report on the SL Fields (\"SL CPR\") in July 2024. The SL CPR confirms the commercial viability of the full-field development\nand\nincreases the Company's proved plus probable (2P) reserves base\nover fivefold\nto 133 mmboe, a substantial driver for enhancing shareholder and investor returns.\nAs we move forward, we remain committed to driving sustainable growth and delivering value to our stakeholders.\"\nH1 2024 Highlights:\nOperational\n\u00b7\nProduction and sales\n\u00b7\nDaily production averaged 12,220 boepd (H1 2023\n: 10,048\nboepd), a 22% increase driven by:\no\nAdditional volumes of dry gas and LPG produced from processing raw gas received from Ural Oil & Gas\nLLP (\"\nUral O&G\"\n)\nat Nostrum's gas processing facilities.\no\nSuccessful launch of the gas-lift system expansion in\u00a0July 2023, which doubled its capacity and helped to slow down the production decline from the maturing Chinarevskoye field.\no\nAdditional LPG production from GTU-3 owing to improved yield by around 20%.\n\u00b7\nThe production volume split for H1 2024 was as follows:\nProducts\nH1 2024\nvolumes\n(boepd)\nH1 2024\nproduct mix\n(%)\nH1 2023\nvolumes\n(boepd)\nH1 2023\nproduct mix\n(%)\nCrude Oil\n2,393\n19.6%\n2,723\n27.1%\nStabilised Condensate*\n1,850\n15.1%\n1,898\n18.9%\nLPG (Liquid Petroleum Gas)\n1,983\n16.2%\n1,258\n12.5%\nDry Gas\n5,994\n49.1%\n4,169\n41.5%\nTotal\n12,220\n100.0%\n10,048\n100.0%\n*Stabilised condensate volumes exclude Ural O&G processed volumes for which Nostrum receives a tolling fee\n\u00b7\nDaily sales volumes averaged 10,475 boepd for H1 2024 (H1 2023\n: 9,020\nboepd).

The well targeted multiple in-fill zones across the Carboniferous and Devonian reservoirs and encountered hydrocarbons (oil, gas-condensate) in all three key intervals. The well was perforated in the lowest of these reservoirs and put into production in May 2024, with initial flow rates in line with the management's expectations. The drilling rig was moved to well No.41 for an appraisal sidetrack targeting the upper Devonian gas-condensate horizon, with completion planned for Q3 2024.\n\u00b7\nStepnoy Leopard Fields\nFollowing the\nfinal investment decision for the initial development phase of the SL Fields in early 2024, Nostrum continued reserves evaluation and\nin July 2024, released\nthe\nSL\nCPR, an evaluation of reserves and resources as of\u00a01 January 2024 prepared by\u00a0Xodus Group Limited. Nostrum has an 80% working interest in the SL Fields.

The SL CPR, an independent third-party evaluation of the reserves and resources of the SL Fields as at 1 January 2024, was prepared by Xodus Group Limited (\"Xodus\").\nArfan Khan, Chief Executive Officer, commented:\n\"The SL CPR demonstrates the commercial viability and potential of the SL Fields full-field development. In particular, as a satellite development to the Chinarevskoye host-processing facilities and export infrastructure, we achieve maximum capital efficiency that serves to strengthen the SL Fields economic robustness whilst adding scale to our operating foot-print. With the Ural Oil & Gas Rozhkovskoye field production already being processed, production from the SL Fields will further improve materially the utilization of our world class 4.2 bcma gas processing facilities and the resulting cashflows (net Nostrum NPV10 of approximately $220 million).\"\nHighlights\n\u00b7\nThe full-field development SL CPR follows Nostrum's final investment decision for the initial field development phase of the SL Fields, supporting the commercial viability of the scalable full-field development targeting the key reservoirs starting with the Eastern fields with subsequent expansion to the Western fields.\n\u00b7\n138 mmboe (including approximately 25% liquids) proved plus probable (2P) gross reserves, increasing Nostrum's reserves base over fivefold (from 23 mmboe to 133 mmboe working interest reserves) and representing material value creation of approximately $220 million of after-tax net (80% working interest) Nostrum NPV10 at 34% IRR, and a substantial driver for increasing shareholder and investor returns.\n\u00b7\nAchievement of this key milestone is another significant step in unlocking the potential and value of Nostrum's existing world-class 4.2 bcma gas processing infrastructure, as part of the Company's implementation of its mixed-asset energy strategy that aims to strengthen the country's energy security and affordability.\n\u00b7\nIn addition, the remaining large discovered, proven un-developed contingent resource base (2C) of 67 mmboe gross across the SL Fields represents a significant potentially commercial opportunity. Future subsurface work is also planned to identify deeper exploration and prospective resources.\nThe following table shows reserves based on the SL CPR at 1 January 2024:\nGross\nWorking Interest (80%)\nUnit\nProved (1P)\nProved &\nProbable\n(2P)\nProved,\nProbable\n&\nPossible\n(3P)\nProved (1P)\nProved &\nProbable\n(2P)\nProved,\nProbable\n&\nPossible\n(3P)\nCondensate & Oil\nmm barrels\n16.96\n26.62\n34.27\n13.58\n21.30\n27.42\nLPG\nktonnes\n414.47\n629.93\n790.66\n331.58\n503.94\n632.53\nSales Gas\nbcf\n408.54\n620.93\n779.36\n326.83\n496.74\n623.49\nTOTAL GROSS\n1\nmmboe\n90\n138\n174\n72\n110\n139\n1\nTotal Gross includes Condensate & Oil (barrels), LPG (boe) and Sales Gas (boe)\nThe Executive Summary of the CPR is available to download on Nostrum's website (\nwww.nog.co.uk\n) under Investors / Documents & Circulars / Documents.

The improved financial performance was underpinned by the lower upstream base production decline owing to expansion of the gas-lift capacity, and increasing midstream third-party production. To safeguard our margins and cash balances, we are continuing to prioritise cost optimisation and capital allocation that maximizes our ability to further grow the midstream business and progress the upstream Stepnoy Leopard development.\"\nQ1 2024 Highlights:\nFinancial\n\u00b7\nRevenues of US$31.8m (Q1 2023 US$17.4m; Q4 2023 US$30.8m), including US$1.7m for processing third-party hydrocarbons. The increase in revenues compared to Q4 2023 was achieved as a result of additional sales volumes from processing third-party Ural Oil & Gas LLP\u00a0(\"Ural O&G\") hydrocarbons, whilst average Brent oil price remained at similar levels (average Brent oil price of US$83.9/bbl for Q4 2023 vs US$82.9/bbl for Q1 2024).\n\u00b7\nEBITDA\n[1]\nof US$10.6m (Q1 2023: US$4.6m; Q4 2023: US$9.1m) with EBITDA margin of 33.3% (Q1 2023 26.4%; Q4 2023 29.5%).\n\u00b7\nThe Group's unrestricted consolidated cash balance as at 31 March 2024 was US$157.6m (31 December 2023 US$161.7m), including current investments in term deposits and money market funds. Quarterly reduction mainly due to investing activities related to Chinarevskoye drilling programme and Stepnoy Leopard appraisal programme. The restricted cash balance was US$25.2m as at 31 March 2024 (31 December 2023 US$25.2m), comprised of the debt-service retention account and liquidation fund deposits.\n\u00b7\nThe Group continues to focus on cost optimisation to help preserving cash balances and enabling growth projects such as Ural O&G third-party processing and Stepnoy Leopard appraisal and project development.\nOperational\n\u00b7\nProduction and sales\n\u00b7\nDaily production, including third-party volumes acquired, averaged 11,943 boepd (Q1 2023\n10,479\nboepd without third-party volumes; Q4 2023 9,527 boepd with nominal third-party volumes).\n\u00b7\nDaily sales volumes averaged 10,022 boepd (Q1 2023\n7,276\nboepd, Q4 2023 8,215 boepd). The difference between production and sales volumes is primarily due to the internal consumption of gas and may also include inventory stock build-up around period end\n.\n\u00b7\nThe production volume split was as follows:\nProducts\nQ1 2024\nvolumes\n(boepd)\nQ1 2024\nproduct mix\n(%)\nQ1 2023\nvolumes\n(boepd)\nQ1 2023\nproduct mix\n(%)\nCrude Oil\n2,382\n19.9%\n2,948\n28.1%\nStabilised Condensate*\n1,934\n16.2%\n1,955\n18.7%\nLPG (Liquid Petroleum Gas)\n1,858\n15.6%\n1,318\n12.6%\nDry Gas\n5,769\n48.3%\n4,259\n40.6%\nTotal\nProcessed\n11,943\n100.0%\n10,479\n100.0%\n*Condensate volumes exclude third-party processed volumes\nProduction and sales volumes were improved in Q1 2024 by the following:\n\u00b7\nAdditional volumes of dry gas and LPG produced from processing raw gas received from Ural O&G Rozhkovskoye field U-21 well at Nostrum's gas processing facilities.\n\u00b7\nSuccessful launch of the Gas lift system expansion in July 2023, which doubled its capacity and helped to slow down the production decline from the maturing Chinarevskoye field.\n\u00b7\nAdditional LPG production from GTU-3 owing to improved yield by 15% to 20%.\n\u00b7\nChinarevskoye drilling programme\nDuring Q1 2024, CHN 301 has been drilled on time and on budget, reaching a total depth of 4,980 meters. The well objective had multiple in-fill targets\u00a0across the Carboniferous and Devonian reservoirs. Hydrocarbons (oil, gas-condensate) have been encountered across all 3 key intervals. The results are in line with the Company's expectations of initial well rates of 400 to 700 boepd, expected to startup mid-year. The drilling rig is being moved\u00a0to the next well, CNH 41 for an appraisal sidetrack, with expected start of operations Q3 2024.\n\u00b7\nStepnoy Leopard fields\nDuring Q1 2024 the two-well appraisal operations on the Stepnoy Leopard Fields\u00a0were largely complete and significant data has been collected, which provided positive results to date and confirmed the commercial potential of the field.

This means production at YE 2020 of =15 Mboe/d. As half the production is gas, it will be at limit that the two smaller gas trains can operate. So, by 2021 gas production can be expected to end and so will LPG and condensate production. Only oil production will be left and based on past product splits will be \u00b12 Mb/d, and declining. Put the 2020 guidance production into a simple cashflow and NOG needs an average 2020 Brent price of \u00b1$39 to end the year with zero cash in the bank. The message is clear. As early as late 2017 the company had two options, 1) Rat\u2019s wheel: spend $s drilling, and try to arrest production decline, or 2) Stop all activity: have a party on the $s in the bank until we are broke. It took them until the end of 2019 to change from 1) to 2). And indeed a \u2018party\u2019 there is. The ex-CEO left in December with a package of $1.4 million, as thanks for building the GTU white elephant and destroying 99% of shareholder value. It has to be said, in all fairness, that does take a certain skill. The Chairman in the annual report is smiling. He should be, he took $500,000 overseeing this exceptional performance. To boot the NOG Board confirms NOG\u2019s imminent demise in the conclusion of their 2019 Annual Report\u2019s Viability Statement!",

Even at 15p, this is a steal IMO so much upside, and if the debt is restructured and capacity filled like you said it will go exponential. We have to remember that we have 46 producing wells and millions in income before we consider the processing plant, yes there is a sizable debt, but as long as the wells produce and we can maintain the debt there is no reason to be concerned imo. DYOR everyone but for me this is still a great buy.",

NOG reported average January sales of 23.8 kboe/d, average Q1 sales of 22.9 kboe/d and average H1 sales of 22.6 kboe/d. Therefore, it is a trivial exercise for anyone to calculate the expected December 2020 sales rate, which will be \u00b112 kboe/d. That means a \u00b150% per annum decline rate for 2020. Previously, the sales decline rate has been around 30% per annum, so, according to NOG\u2019s own reported sales volumes and published 2020 guidance the decline rate is accelerating. Game over.",

These are generally not capital intensive and offer reasonable risk / reward. These activities will continue in 2022. \u00b7     We continue our focus on pursuing ways to monetise spare capacity in the gas treatment facility through processing third party volumes. \u00b7     We remain extremely vigilant in respect of COVID-19 and the latest Omicron variant.

One is to treat their condensate, where it's very simple, we'll get paid $8 a barrel on that condensate. So they send through the -- through our gas treatment unit starting in Q4 of 2020. And then we will be purchasing a stream of Ural Gas, which is essentially us purchasing the LPG and dry gas from them. And this is done on a formula which is all the small details are confidential. But in order to give you an idea, they have 8 wells that they've drilled, which will come online and should produce, according to Wood Mackenzie, around 15,000 BOEs per day with a similar split of liquids and gas as Nostrum has from its gas condensate reservoirs. If you take those -- if you take that production and you put it through assuming the $8 per barrel of condensate treatment for your processing fee and you then assume our current prices for sales gas and LPG, then you will generate to Nostrum on a per annum basis approximately $50 million of additional free cash flow.",

Form 8.5, meanwhile, should be completed by any principal trader that has dealt in the shares.

The only positive for now is that they are not going to burn more CAPEX drilling random holes etc.   At least on a cash basis they should be able to service the debt for another couple of years while they do some deals on gas processing ... or get better analysis of their reservoirs and where to drill.

Well the Sp has dropped by over 50% since 31st and there are still posters believing everything in the garden is rosy, cannot help some people, especially Wigwammer.

On 01.02.19 I predicted that the company would experience negative cashflow in 2020, with zero cash and a debt of $1.1B at the end of 2020. And so it will be. There is zero 3rd party gas, that is ZERO, in the vicinity of Nostrum\u2019s operations. Yet another piece of misinformation from the NOG Board.

This means production at YE 2020 of =15 Mboe/d. As half the production is gas, it will be at limit that the two smaller gas trains can operate. So, by 2021 gas production can be expected to end and so will LPG and condensate production. Only oil production will be left and based on past product splits will be \u00b12 Mb/d, and declining. Put the 2020 guidance production into a simple cashflow and NOG needs an average 2020 Brent price of \u00b1$39 to end the year with zero cash in the bank. The message is clear. As early as late 2017 the company had two options, 1) Rat\u2019s wheel: spend $s drilling, and try to arrest production decline, or 2) Stop all activity: have a party on the $s in the bank until we are broke. It took them until the end of 2019 to change from 1) to 2). And indeed a \u2018party\u2019 there is. The ex-CEO left in December with a package of $1.4 million, as thanks for building the GTU white elephant and destroying 99% of shareholder value. It has to be said, in all fairness, that does take a certain skill. The Chairman in the annual report is smiling. He should be, he took $500,000 overseeing this exceptional performance. To boot the NOG Board confirms NOG\u2019s imminent demise in the conclusion of their 2019 Annual Report\u2019s Viability Statement!",

We have to remember that we have 46 producing wells and millions in income before we consider the processing plant, yes there is a sizable debt, but as long as the wells produce and we can maintain the debt there is no reason to be concerned imo.

Condensate is sold when there are sufficient volumes to fill a cargo and inventory builds in the absence of a sale. There was approximately 268,000 boe of condensate in inventory at the year end. \u00b7     We continued our well and reservoir management activities that are supported by well workovers and interventions. These are generally not capital intensive and offer reasonable risk / reward. These activities will continue in 2022. \u00b7     We continue our focus on pursuing ways to monetise spare capacity in the gas treatment facility through processing third party volumes. \u00b7     We remain extremely vigilant in respect of COVID-19 and the latest Omicron variant. We continue to implement stringent precautionary measures and we believe we have the systems in place to monitor and manage the risks presented by the pandemic in west Kazakhstan. To date, no production has been lost because of COVID-19.",

One is to treat their condensate, where it's very simple, we'll get paid $8 a barrel on that condensate. So they send through the -- through our gas treatment unit starting in Q4 of 2020. And then we will be purchasing a stream of Ural Gas, which is essentially us purchasing the LPG and dry gas from them. And this is done on a formula which is all the small details are confidential. But in order to give you an idea, they have 8 wells that they've drilled, which will come online and should produce, according to Wood Mackenzie, around 15,000 BOEs per day with a similar split of liquids and gas as Nostrum has from its gas condensate reservoirs. If you take those -- if you take that production and you put it through assuming the $8 per barrel of condensate treatment for your processing fee and you then assume our current prices for sales gas and LPG, then you will generate to Nostrum on a per annum basis approximately $50 million of additional free cash flow.",

Financial: \u00b7    Revenue of US$250.3 million (9M 2018: US$311.4 million) - down mainly due to oil price, with this now predicted to rise we could recover some of that loss. \u00b7    Net operating cash flows of US$160.2 million (9M 2018: US$151.3 million) - Up due to efficiencies \u00b7    EBITDA margin of 63.3% (9M 2018: 60.3%) - More profitable \u00b7    Closing cash for the period of US$91.3 million - Down slightly due to revenue reduction but a solid balance. \u00b7    Total debt of US$1,113 million - Debt being paid down from revenue Operational \u00b7    GTU3 commissioning complete - Huge bonus to have this now online. \u00b7    44 wells currently producing - 18 oil wells and 26 gas condensate wells - Solid producing assets \u00b7    9M 2019 average production after treatment of 28,877 boepd \u00b7    9M 2019 average sales volumes of 27,515 boepd \u00b7    Schlumberger and PM Lucas reports delivered to the Company - Will help add further effiencies for the business model. \u00b7    Extended licences for the Rostoshinskoye and the Chinarevskoye fields \u00b7    The company in June began a strategic review, which could include a sale of the firm. Shares were 4.1% higher on Tuesday morning in London at 21.70 pence each, having lost 89% over the past 12 months. Five years ago, they were worth 623.00p. Yes, there is debt but as noted this is being paid down inline with the terms of the loans with income from our producing assets, with a historic price of 623p and 44 producing wells, there is a huge upside here and the possibility of a sale.

Fine if you don't want to listen, but take heed this will drop further unless debt is sorted, and quick!",

In my post of 21.05.19, my prediction was that the best the 2P reserves volume could be was =120 MMboe. That was very close and they are probably overstated even now, after this massive revision. Currently, the cash in hand is just $65 MM, and production decline continues. On 01.02.19 I predicted that the company would experience negative cashflow in 2020, with zero cash and a debt of $1.1B at the end of 2020. And so it will be. There is zero 3rd party gas, that is ZERO, in the vicinity of Nostrum\u2019s operations. Yet another piece of misinformation from the NOG Board. So, the entire plant of 400 MMscf/d of capacity will have to be mothballed in 2021. End of story - lights out. Exactly as expected.",

          "content": "The NOG guidance for 2020 is 19 Mboe/d (or kboe/d, as preferred). It is trivial to calculate that that represents a \u00b133% per annum decline in 2020. This means production at YE 2020 of =15 Mboe/d. As half the production is gas, it will be at limit that the two smaller gas trains can operate. So, by 2021 gas production can be expected to end and so will LPG and condensate production. Only oil production will be left and based on past product splits will be \u00b12 Mb/d, and declining. Put the 2020 guidance production into a simple cashflow and NOG needs an average 2020 Brent price of \u00b1$39 to end the year with zero cash in the bank. The message is clear. As early as late 2017 the company had two options, 1) Rat\u2019s wheel: spend $s drilling, and try to arrest production decline, or 2) Stop all activity: have a party on the $s in the bank until we are broke. It took them until the end of 2019 to change from 1) to 2). And indeed a \u2018party\u2019 there is. The ex-CEO left in December with a package of $1.4 million, as thanks for building the GTU white elephant and destroying 99% of shareholder value. It has to be said, in all fairness, that does take a certain skill. The Chairman in the annual report is smiling. He should be, he took $500,000 overseeing this exceptional performance. To boot the NOG Board confirms NOG\u2019s imminent demise in the conclusion of their 2019 Annual Report\u2019s Viability Statement!",

Condensate is sold when there are sufficient volumes to fill a cargo and inventory builds in the absence of a sale. There was approximately 268,000 boe of condensate in inventory at the year end. \u00b7     We continued our well and reservoir management activities that are supported by well workovers and interventions. These are generally not capital intensive and offer reasonable risk / reward. These activities will continue in 2022. \u00b7     We continue our focus on pursuing ways to monetise spare capacity in the gas treatment facility through processing third party volumes. \u00b7     We remain extremely vigilant in respect of COVID-19 and the latest Omicron variant. We continue to implement stringent precautionary measures and we believe we have the systems in place to monitor and manage the risks presented by the pandemic in west Kazakhstan.

          "content": "The NOG guidance for 2020 is 19 Mboe/d (or kboe/d, as preferred). It is trivial to calculate that that represents a \u00b133% per annum decline in 2020. This means production at YE 2020 of =15 Mboe/d. As half the production is gas, it will be at limit that the two smaller gas trains can operate. So, by 2021 gas production can be expected to end and so will LPG and condensate production. Only oil production will be left and based on past product splits will be \u00b12 Mb/d, and declining. Put the 2020 guidance production into a simple cashflow and NOG needs an average 2020 Brent price of \u00b1$39 to end the year with zero cash in the bank. The message is clear. As early as late 2017 the company had two options, 1) Rat\u2019s wheel: spend $s drilling, and try to arrest production decline, or 2) Stop all activity: have a party on the $s in the bank until we are broke. It took them until the end of 2019 to change from 1) to 2). And indeed a \u2018party\u2019 there is. The ex-CEO left in December with a package of $1.4 million, as thanks for building the GTU white elephant and destroying 99% of shareholder value. It has to be said, in all fairness, that does take a certain skill. The Chairman in the annual report is smiling. He should be, he took $500,000 overseeing this exceptional performance. To boot the NOG Board confirms NOG\u2019s imminent demise in the conclusion of their 2019 Annual Report\u2019s Viability Statement!",

Currently, the cash in hand is just $65 MM, and production decline continues. On 01.02.19 I predicted that the company would experience negative cashflow in 2020, with zero cash and a debt of $1.1B at the end of 2020. And so it will be. There is zero 3rd party gas, that is ZERO, in the vicinity of Nostrum\u2019s operations. Yet another piece of misinformation from the NOG Board. So, the entire plant of 400 MMscf/d of capacity will have to be mothballed in 2021. End of story - lights out. Exactly as expected.",

This update is being issued in advance of the release of Nostrum's audited consolidated accounts for the same period. The financial information disclosed in this announcement is unaudited and remains subject to the completion of Nostrum's year-end external audit.\nViktor Gladun, Chief Executive Officer of Nostrum Oil & Gas, commented:\n\"Nostrum remains dedicated to driving strategic growth through strong leadership while upholding the highest standards of health and safety.\n2025 was a year of continued operational and strategic progress, achieved despite lower oil prices and natural decline at the mature Chinarevskoye Field. The business demonstrated resilience through reliable operations, disciplined capital management, and a 23.2% increase in average processed volumes, driven by the ramp\u2011up of third-party feedstock and stable plant performance. Together with the successful drilling and workover programme at Chinarevskoye, this resulted in higher titled production and sales volumes year-on-year. New well 116_1 was brought onstream at the end of November 2025 following the successful completion activities and is delivering production levels consistent with management's expectations.\nDuring the year, we advanced planning for the Stepnoy Leopard development options while ensuring alignment with project objectives and regulatory requirements.\nLooking ahead, Nostrum remains focused on maximising asset value, deepening strategic partnerships, restructuring debt maturing in June 2026, maintaining financial discipline, and delivering enduring benefits for shareholders, stakeholders and the people of Kazakhstan.\"\nFY 2025 Highlights:\nOperational\n\u00b7\nProduction and sales\n\u00a7\nA 23.2% increase in average processed volumes (including third party condensate tolling volumes) to 24,431 boepd in FY 2025 (FY 2024: 19,831 boepd). A 12.9% increase in average daily titled production volumes (i.e. final products processed and owned by Nostrum) to 16,867 boepd in FY 2025 (FY 2024: 14,935 boepd). These increases were achieved through continuing to process the ramping up feedstock from Ural Oil & Gas\u00a0LLP\u00a0(\"Ural O&G\"), and managing expected decline in Chinarevskoye production through well workovers.\n\u00a7\nThe titled production volume split was as follows:\nProducts\nFY 2025\nvolumes\n(boepd)\nFY 2024\nvolumes\n(boepd)\nY-on-Y\nChange\n(%)\nFY 2025\nproduct mix\n(%)\nFY 2024\nproduct mix\n(%)\nCrude Oil\n2,343\n2,536\n(7.6)%\n13.9%\n17.0%\nStabilised Condensate*\n1,664\n1,897\n(12.3)%\n9.9%\n12.7%\nLPG (Liquid Petroleum Gas)\n3,162\n2,537\n24.6%\n18.7%\n17.0%\nDry Gas\n9,698\n7,965\n21.8%\n57.5%\n53.3%\nTotal\n16,867\n14,935\n12.9%\n100.0%\n100.0%\n*Stabilised condensate volumes exclude Ural O&G processed volumes for which Nostrum receives a fixed tolling fee\n\u00a7\nA 16.2% increase in average daily sales volumes to 15,146 boepd in FY 2025 (FY 2024: 13,038 boepd), reflecting higher titled production. The difference between titled production and sales volumes is primarily due to the internal consumption of dry gas produced and timing of product deliveries, which may lead to inventory increases or decreases at period end.\n\u00b7\nChinarevskoye drilling and workover programme\nThe Company's Chinarevskoye limited-scale drilling programme for 2025 targeted most economic subsurface opportunities while also ensuring compliance with license obligations.\nOn 13 October 2025, the Company successfully completed drilling operations on the well 116_1. After completing perforation, stimulation and flowline tie-in, the well was put on production on 21 November 2025, achieving production rates in line with management's expectations. In parallel, during the year the Company continued to carry out optimised well workovers to minimise production decline and enhance operational efficiency.\nA comprehensive review and assessment of potential well workovers and new drilling prospects is underway.\n\u00b7\nStepnoy Leopard Fields\nA comprehensive review of the overall development strategy for the Stepnoy Leopard Fields is underway, taking into account key factors such as project economics, infrastructure access, sales delivery points, compliance with regulatory requirements and licence commitments.\n\u00b7\nProcessing of Ural O&G products\nThroughout FY 2025, the Company continued processing raw gas and cond",

This means production at YE 2020 of =15 Mboe/d. As half the production is gas, it will be at limit that the two smaller gas trains can operate. So, by 2021 gas production can be expected to end and so will LPG and condensate production. Only oil production will be left and based on past product splits will be \u00b12 Mb/d, and declining. Put the 2020 guidance production into a simple cashflow and NOG needs an average 2020 Brent price of \u00b1$39 to end the year with zero cash in the bank. The message is clear. As early as late 2017 the company had two options, 1) Rat\u2019s wheel: spend $s drilling, and try to arrest production decline, or 2) Stop all activity: have a party on the $s in the bank until we are broke. It took them until the end of 2019 to change from 1) to 2). And indeed a \u2018party\u2019 there is. The ex-CEO left in December with a package of $1.4 million, as thanks for building the GTU white elephant and destroying 99% of shareholder value. It has to be said, in all fairness, that does take a certain skill. The Chairman in the annual report is smiling. He should be, he took $500,000 overseeing this exceptional performance. To boot the NOG Board confirms NOG\u2019s imminent demise in the conclusion of their 2019 Annual Report\u2019s Viability Statement!",

The tax authorities have asserted withholding tax claims for such three year period totalling approximately USD 71 million (comprising USD 52 million relating to the 2018/2019 audits and USD 19 million in potential claims for 2020), which the Company believes contradict applicable laws and treaties and arbitral, administrative and judicial practice. Since commencement of operations in Kazakhstan in 1997, ZKM has paid in aggregate more than USD 1.24 billion in taxes, royalties and other payments to the RoK\n.\nOn 28 January 2026, ZKM was informed that the RoK Ministry of Finance Appeal Board has scheduled a hearing on 5 February 2026 to consider ZKM's appeals of the tax audits for 2018 and 2019, following the resumption of proceedings after a prior period of suspension. The Company expects that the Appeal Board will consider all relevant facts together with national and international laws, and take into account all relevant treaties, including the relevant double tax treaty between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and RoK, pursuant to which the Dutch tax authorities have initiated a mutual agreement procedure (\"\nMAP\n\") in respect of the pertinent claims. The outcome of the hearing remains uncertain and may result in further procedural steps in accordance with applicable laws rather than a final determination.\nThe scheduling of the hearing represents a further step in the progression of the dispute. The Company continues to monitor developments closely and to take appropriate steps to protect its interests.\nThe Company is incorporated under the laws of England and Wales and listed on the London Stock Exchange. Its investor base is international, with investors predominantly based in the United States. In addition, the Company's wholly owned subsidiary Nostrum Oil & Gas Finance BV, incorporated in the Netherlands, is the issuer of the Group's senior secured notes and senior unsecured notes.\nThe Company will continue to defend its interests and to assess all available legal remedies.\nFurther updates will be issued as appropriate.\nLEI: 2138007VWEP4MM3J8B29\nFurther information\nFor further information please visit\nwww.nostrumoilandgas.com\nFurther enquiries\nNostrum Oil & Gas PLC\nYelena Zhuravleva, CFO\nir@nog.co.uk\nTEAM LEWIS\nGalyna Kulachek\n+ 44 (0) 20 7802 2664\nnostrum@teamlewis.com\nAbout Nostrum Oil & Gas\nNostrum Oil & Gas PLC is an independent mixed-asset energy company with world-class gas processing facilities and export hub in north-west Kazakhstan.

We have to remember that we have 46 producing wells and millions in income before we consider the processing plant, yes there is a sizable debt, but as long as the wells produce and we can maintain the debt there is no reason to be concerned imo.

Put the 2020 guidance production into a simple cashflow and NOG needs an average 2020 Brent price of \u00b1$39 to end the year with zero cash in the bank. The message is clear. As early as late 2017 the company had two options, 1) Rat\u2019s wheel: spend $s drilling, and try to arrest production decline, or 2) Stop all activity: have a party on the $s in the bank until we are broke. It took them until the end of 2019 to change from 1) to 2). And indeed a \u2018party\u2019 there is. The ex-CEO left in December with a package of $1.4 million, as thanks for building the GTU white elephant and destroying 99% of shareholder value. It has to be said, in all fairness, that does take a certain skill. The Chairman in the annual report is smiling. He should be, he took $500,000 overseeing this exceptional performance. To boot the NOG Board confirms NOG\u2019s imminent demise in the conclusion of their 2019 Annual Report\u2019s Viability Statement!",

Currently, the cash in hand is just $65 MM, and production decline continues. On 01.02.19 I predicted that the company would experience negative cashflow in 2020, with zero cash and a debt of $1.1B at the end of 2020. And so it will be. There is zero 3rd party gas, that is ZERO, in the vicinity of Nostrum\u2019s operations. Yet another piece of misinformation from the NOG Board. So, the entire plant of 400 MMscf/d of capacity will have to be mothballed in 2021. End of story - lights out. Exactly as expected.",

ZKM understands that the Appeal Board is reviewing and considering communications from the Dutch tax authority pursuant to the mutual agreement procedure (\"\nMAP\n\") under the relevant double tax treaty between the Kingdom of\u00a0the Netherlands\u00a0and the RoK (the \"\nRoK-NL Treaty\n\") in respect of the pertinent claims, which may result in the suspension of the appeal pending the outcome of the MAP.\nParagraph 3 of Article 4 of the RoK Constitution provides that international treaties ratified by the RoK (such as the RoK-NL Treaty) have priority over RoK domestic laws (including the RoK tax code) and RoK Supreme Court precedent provides that where an international treaty contains a mutual agreement procedure such as the MAP, for the good faith performance of the treaty such mutual agreement procedure, when invoked, should be conducted between the competent authorities of the two states party to the treaty to achieve the goals of such treaty. A treaty party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for a failure to perform its treaty obligations.\nAs previously announced, the Company believes that the tax claims made by the RoK tax authorities resulting from their tax audits of ZKM for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020, which deny ZKM the benefit of relevant and valid exemptions from, or reductions to, withholding tax payable under RoK law on certain bonds issued by Group companies, remuneration on an intra-Group loan, and income from consulting services, respectively, are without merit.\nThe Company continues to monitor developments closely and will continue to defend its interests and to assess all available legal and treaty-based remedies.\nFurther updates will be issued as appropriate.\nLEI: 2138007VWEP4MM3J8B29\nFurther information\nFor further information please visit\nwww.nostrumoilandgas.com\nFurther enquiries\nNostrum Oil & Gas PLC\nYelena Zhuravleva, CFO\nir@nog.co.uk\nTEAM LEWIS\nGalyna Kulachek\n+ 44 (0) 20 7802 2664\nnostrum@teamlewis.com\nAbout\u00a0Nostrum Oil & Gas\nNostrum Oil & Gas PLC\u00a0is an independent mixed-asset energy company with world-class gas processing facilities and export hub in north-west Kazakhstan.

NOG reported average January sales of 23.8 kboe/d, average Q1 sales of 22.9 kboe/d and average H1 sales of 22.6 kboe/d. Therefore, it is a trivial exercise for anyone to calculate the expected December 2020 sales rate, which will be \u00b112 kboe/d. That means a \u00b150% per annum decline rate for 2020. Previously, the sales decline rate has been around 30% per annum, so, according to NOG\u2019s own reported sales volumes and published 2020 guidance the decline rate is accelerating. Game over.",

We have to remember that we have 46 producing wells and millions in income before we consider the processing plant, yes there is a sizable debt, but as long as the wells produce and we can maintain the debt there is no reason to be concerned imo.

This means production at YE 2020 of =15 Mboe/d. As half the production is gas, it will be at limit that the two smaller gas trains can operate. So, by 2021 gas production can be expected to end and so will LPG and condensate production. Only oil production will be left and based on past product splits will be \u00b12 Mb/d, and declining. Put the 2020 guidance production into a simple cashflow and NOG needs an average 2020 Brent price of \u00b1$39 to end the year with zero cash in the bank. The message is clear. As early as late 2017 the company had two options, 1) Rat\u2019s wheel: spend $s drilling, and try to arrest production decline, or 2) Stop all activity: have a party on the $s in the bank until we are broke. It took them until the end of 2019 to change from 1) to 2). And indeed a \u2018party\u2019 there is. The ex-CEO left in December with a package of $1.4 million, as thanks for building the GTU white elephant and destroying 99% of shareholder value. It has to be said, in all fairness, that does take a certain skill. The Chairman in the annual report is smiling. He should be, he took $500,000 overseeing this exceptional performance. To boot the NOG Board confirms NOG\u2019s imminent demise in the conclusion of their 2019 Annual Report\u2019s Viability Statement!",

This means production at YE 2020 of =15 Mboe/d. As half the production is gas, it will be at limit that the two smaller gas trains can operate. So, by 2021 gas production can be expected to end and so will LPG and condensate production. Only oil production will be left and based on past product splits will be \u00b12 Mb/d, and declining. Put the 2020 guidance production into a simple cashflow and NOG needs an average 2020 Brent price of \u00b1$39 to end the year with zero cash in the bank. The message is clear. As early as late 2017 the company had two options, 1) Rat\u2019s wheel: spend $s drilling, and try to arrest production decline, or 2) Stop all activity: have a party on the $s in the bank until we are broke. It took them until the end of 2019 to change from 1) to 2). And indeed a \u2018party\u2019 there is. The ex-CEO left in December with a package of $1.4 million, as thanks for building the GTU white elephant and destroying 99% of shareholder value. It has to be said, in all fairness, that does take a certain skill. The Chairman in the annual report is smiling. He should be, he took $500,000 overseeing this exceptional performance. To boot the NOG Board confirms NOG\u2019s imminent demise in the conclusion of their 2019 Annual Report\u2019s Viability Statement!",

We have to remember that we have 46 producing wells and millions in income before we consider the processing plant, yes there is a sizable debt, but as long as the wells produce and we can maintain the debt there is no reason to be concerned imo.

This means production at YE 2020 of =15 Mboe/d. As half the production is gas, it will be at limit that the two smaller gas trains can operate. So, by 2021 gas production can be expected to end and so will LPG and condensate production. Only oil production will be left and based on past product splits will be \u00b12 Mb/d, and declining. Put the 2020 guidance production into a simple cashflow and NOG needs an average 2020 Brent price of \u00b1$39 to end the year with zero cash in the bank. The message is clear. As early as late 2017 the company had two options, 1) Rat\u2019s wheel: spend $s drilling, and try to arrest production decline, or 2) Stop all activity: have a party on the $s in the bank until we are broke. It took them until the end of 2019 to change from 1) to 2). And indeed a \u2018party\u2019 there is. The ex-CEO left in December with a package of $1.4 million, as thanks for building the GTU white elephant and destroying 99% of shareholder value. It has to be said, in all fairness, that does take a certain skill. The Chairman in the annual report is smiling. He should be, he took $500,000 overseeing this exceptional performance. To boot the NOG Board confirms NOG\u2019s imminent demise in the conclusion of their 2019 Annual Report\u2019s Viability Statement!",

In my post of 21.05.19, my prediction was that the best the 2P reserves volume could be was =120 MMboe. That was very close and they are probably overstated even now, after this massive revision. Currently, the cash in hand is just $65 MM, and production decline continues. On 01.02.19 I predicted that the company would experience negative cashflow in 2020, with zero cash and a debt of $1.1B at the end of 2020. And so it will be. There is zero 3rd party gas, that is ZERO, in the vicinity of Nostrum\u2019s operations. Yet another piece of misinformation from the NOG Board. So, the entire plant of 400 MMscf/d of capacity will have to be mothballed in 2021. End of story - lights out. Exactly as expected.",

We will continue to monitor the situation and any potential future impact on the business. \u00b7     Average daily production after treatment for 2021 totalled 17,032 boepd with average daily sales volumes for the year of 15,330 boepd. Condensate is sold when there are sufficient volumes to fill a cargo and inventory builds in the absence of a sale. There was approximately 268,000 boe of condensate in inventory at the year end. \u00b7     We continued our well and reservoir management activities that are supported by well workovers and interventions. These are generally not capital intensive and offer reasonable risk / reward. These activities will continue in 2022. \u00b7     We continue our focus on pursuing ways to monetise spare capacity in the gas treatment facility through processing third party volumes. \u00b7     We remain extremely vigilant in respect of COVID-19 and the latest Omicron variant. We continue to implement stringent precautionary measures and we believe we have the systems in place to monitor and manage the risks presented by the pandemic in west Kazakhstan. To date, no production has been lost because of COVID-19.",
