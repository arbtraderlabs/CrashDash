Completion of the acquisition, and its renaming to Angra Global, followed the receipt of approval from the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (\"FINTRAC\"), the regulatory authority overseeing financial transactions in Canada, for the change of control.\nThe MSB licence held by PAYPT encompasses a range of financial activities, including: foreign exchange dealing; cryptoasset dealing; money transfer services; and authorisations for the issuance of debit cards and IBANs.\nAngra Global has been combined operationally with the Group's existing UK-based foreign exchange and payment services company, Angra Limited (\"Angra\"), an FCA approved Authorised Payment Institution (\"API\"), as part of the Group's strategic intention for the combined Angra entities to be a B2B-focused Neobank. The Group now offers a multi-currency e-wallet service, initially covering Sterling, Euro, US Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Chinese Yuan Renminbi and US Dollar Tether Token transactions. Angra Global started onboarding customers for this service from 1 September 2023 and it enables Angra customers to securely store their funds within Angra Global business accounts and facilitate seamless foreign exchange conversions and fund transfers through Angra's established and reliable banking partnerships, akin to a conventional business bank account, utilising technology developed by the Group's subsidiary in Singapore, GS Fintech Pte Ltd. Additionally, the MSB licence enables Angra to issue Sterling local accounts and Euro SEPA IBAN accounts to its clients, thereby providing a comprehensive one-stop business banking solution.\nAligned with its overarching strategy, the Group is focused on accelerating Angra's revenue while simultaneously bolstering the Angra team to expand its B2B Neobank operations beyond the UK, serving companies of all sizes worldwide. As part of this expansion strategy, p\nost period end on 29 November 2023, t\nhe Company entered into an option to purchase agreement to acquire 60% of the share capital of EasySend Ltd (\"EasySend\"), a Northern Ireland incorporated company operating a cross-border payments business.\nEasySend is a an FCA approved API, conducting cross-border payment services.\nEasySend has a current estimated yearly transaction volume of approximately \u00a3120 million, with 35% coming from approximately 40,000 individual customers and 65% from approximately 350 active corporate customers. We believe the acquisition of a majority stake in EasySend will assist with growing the customer base for the Company's existing GS Money activities, in particular Angra Global, and provide access to additional technology, including EasySend's mobile terminal technology. It is intended that EasySend's founder and management team will remain with the business and that the 40% minority holding will be retained by EasySend's founder.\nCompletion of the acquisition of EasySend is conditional,\ninter alia\n, on final due diligence, the entering into of definitive sale and purchase documentation and also on GST obtaining approval from the FCA for the change of control of EasySend, a regulated entity.\nPost period end on 6 December 2023 we also announced that the\nCompany had entered into an agreement to acquire 66.67% of the issued share capital of Semnet Pte Ltd (\"Semnet\"), a cybersecurity company based in Singapore, for a total consideration of US$1.8 million, payable through US$0.8 million in cash and US$1.0 million in new shares in the Company.\nSemnet is a profitable cybersecurity business that will provide the Company with expertise and licences that the Board believe are a critical component to the advancement of the Company's GS Money and B2B Neobanking operations. Cybersecurity is of particular importance to the Company's developing global Neobank ecosystem. With Angra Global having started onboarding customers on 1 September 2023, Semnet's cybersecurity expertise will enable the Company to build a dedicated cybersecurity team to support client onboarding and its operational activities, including the wider provision of white-label software solutions to global money service businesses. In addition, Semnet will continue to support and grow its client base in other sectors, providing an additional profitable revenue stream for the Group. Semnet is licensed by the Cyber Security Regulatory Office (CRSO) in Singapore. Completion of the Semnet acquisition is subject,\ninter alia\n, to the agreement of a completion assets statement, which may require adjustment of the consideration upwards or downwards, and no material adverse change having occurred in the Semnet business. Completion is expected to occur in early February 2024, or earlier as may be agreed between the parties.\nFollowing the acquisition of Glindala (now GS Fintech UAB), a holder of a Crypto Currency Exchange Licence registered in Lithuania, in August 2022, GST soft launched the Company's GS20 cryptoasset exchange in November 2022. The GS20 Exchange is offering spot trading and over-the-counter trading desk services for popular cryptoassets, although it is not a pure cryptocurrency exchange. The soft launch has been successfully completed and the development of the GS20 Exchange has progressed in accordance with the Board's expectations, with a wider roll-out now being undertaken. There has been a progressive build-up of signed-up users, and the Company are greatly encouraged by the market traction the GS20 Exchange is enjoying. The GS20 Exchange is generating revenue for the Company via trading commissions at varying levels depending on the type and size of transaction undertaken.\nAs a further key pillar of the stablecoin activities that the Group intends to carry out in strategic jurisdictions, including the UK, the Company applied to the FCA for the Company's stablecoins to be admitted to the FCA Regulatory Sandbox. In June 2023, the Company was informed by the FCA that they had concluded that the Company's stablecoin application did not currently meet the FCA's strict criteria for admission to the FCA Regulatory Sandbox. As an alternative the FCA offered the Company a place on their Innovations Pathway programme, an initiative designed to support financial services firms in launching innovative products and services, which the Company was pleased to accept. Under the FCA Innovation Pathway programme, the Company is being provided with a dedicated FCA case officer and a comprehensive range of support services, designed to assist GST to further develop the appropriate path for the progression of its stablecoin plans. This may involve a future Regulatory Sandbox application or preparation for regulatory authorisation without the need for supervised testing. Although the Company initially viewed admission of its stablecoins to the FCA Regulatory Sandbox as an appropriate next step, the Innovations Pathway programme is enabling GST to benefit further from the guidance of the FCA and progress its stablecoin plans.\nBoard\nOn 15 June 2023 Chong Loong Fatt Garies, Non-executive Director, resigned from the Board in order to focus on his other business endeavours. On behalf of the Board I would like to thank Garies for his contribution to GST and we wish him well in his future endeavours.\nFunding\nIn order to accelerate the implementation of the Group's GS Money strategy, including via acquisition, the Company has undertaken fundraising activities as the Board has deemed appropriate to facilitate the maximisation of overall shareholder value.\nDuring the previous year the Company entered into an unsecured convertible loan facility to receive funding of up to US$1.6 million (the \"Loan Facility\") with an institutional investor. US$800,000 of the Loan Facility was drawn down. The Loan Facility was cancelled on 29 March 2023, with the second instalment of US$800,000 undrawn. On 4 April 2023\nthe remaining US$285,000 principal amount of the Loan Facility and the associated interest of US$28,500 (10%), was converted into new ordinary shares of no-par value in the capital of the Company (\"Ordinary Shares\").\nFollowing this conversion no principal amount or associated interest remains outstanding under the Loan Facility.\nOn 17 May 2023 the Company has raised gross proceeds of \u00a3750,000 through a placing of 75,000,000 Ordinary Shares at a price of 1.0 pence per share.\nPost period end, on 14 November 2023, the Company\nraised gross proceeds of \u00a3847,000 through a placing of 77,000,000 Ordinary Shares at a price of 1.10 pence per share.\nThe Board is mindful of dilution for existing shareholders, and the Company will only undertake further fundraising activities if the Board believes additional capital is required to achieve the Company's strategic goals.\nFinancial performance\nFollowing the completion of the disposal of EMS Wiring Systems in October 2022 the Group's revenue for the period from operations of US$256,000 (H1 2022 US$1,799,000) was purely generated from the Company's GS Money activities, primarily Angra Limited in the UK during the period. Revenues were limited whilst the GS Money offerings were rolled out and the Board anticipates revenues to grow in the second half of the financial year.\nWith a strong focus on cost control the Group's net loss for the period reduced to\nUS$737,000 (H1 2022: US$1,153,000 loss) as the Company continued to invest in developing its GS Money solutions, both organically and through acquisition.\nThe Group had US$2,198,000 in cash and cash equivalents as at 30 September 2023 (30 September 2022: US$3,334,000), with the cash resources bolstered by the net proceeds of the \u00a3847,000 (approximately US$1,100,000) equity fund raise undertaken in November 2023.\nSummary\nOur stated strategy with GS Money is to make cross-border payments quick and affordable to an addressable market of millions of participants by netting and settling trades through a stablecoin-based payments network. With the formation of Angra Global, the Group has both an FCA approved API and a Canadian MSB licence to enable the Group to conduct fast, secure, and low-cost foreign exchange business and payment services internationally, together with the ability to offer further services. Additionally, with the GS20 Exchange we have a regulated, operational, trading platform offering spot trading and over-the-counter trading desk services for popular cryptoassets, although it is much more than a pure cryptocurrency exchange, providing the clearing and settlement needs of both retail and institutional customers with high compliance and security standards.\nIn the second half of the financial year we are looking to\ngrow revenues substantially from these businesses and to complete the two acquisitions that will both add additional customers and capabilities to the Group.\nWith the Angra Global and GS20 Exchange platforms in place, the FCA stablecoin plans being progressed, and two recently announced complimentary acquisitions to complete, these are exciting times for GST. We are a focused, 'pure play' fintech group with solid platforms on which build and to continue to role out our GS Money solutions. We will also continue to explore any further value enhancing acquisition opportunities that may become available and that can assist with accelerating the development of the Group.\nI believe there is a very bright future for GST and I look forward to reporting on our further progress in the coming months.\nTone Kay Kim GOH\nChairman\nEnquiries:\nThe Company\nTone Goh, Executive Chairman\n+65 6444

General Information\n1.1. Corporate information\nThe consolidated financial statements of GSTechnologies Ltd (the \"Company\") and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as \"the Group\" for the financial period from 1 April 2023 and ended 30 September 2023 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 20 December 2023.\nThe registered office of GSTechnologies Ltd, the ultimate parent of the Group, is Ritter House, Wickhams Cay II, Road Town, Tortola, BVI VG1110.\nThe principal activity of the Company comprises of fintech services through the use of blockchain technology; and the provision of data infrastructure, storage and technology services by its subsidiaries.\n2. Basis of preparation\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and adopted by the United Kingdom as they apply to the financial statements of the Group for the period 1 April 2023 to 30 September 2023.\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost convention basis, except for certain financial instruments that have been measured at fair value. The consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand except when otherwise indicated.\n2.1 Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Group as of 30 September 2023, and for the period then ended.\nSubsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date when such control ceases.\nThe financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the GSTechnologies Ltd (parent company), using consistent accounting.\nAll intra-group balances, transactions, unrealised gains and losses resulting from intra-group transactions and dividends are eliminated in full.\nTotal comprehensive income within a subsidiary is attributed to the non-controlling interest even if it results in a deficit balance. A change ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction.\nBusiness Combinations\nBusiness combinations occur where an acquirer obtains control over one or more businesses. A business combination is accounted for by applying the acquisition method, unless it is a combination involving entities or businesses under common control. The business combination will be accounted for from the date that control is attained, whereby the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) assumed is recognised (subject to certain limited exceptions).\nWhen measuring the consideration transferred in the business combination, any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement is also included. Subsequent to initial recognition, contingent consideration classified as equity is not re-measured and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability is re-measured in each reporting period to fair value, recognising any change to fair value in profit or loss, unless the change in value can be identified as existing at acquisition date.\nAll transaction costs incurred in relation to business combinations are expensed to the statement of comprehensive income. The acquisition of a business may result in the recognition of goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase.\n3. Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions\nThe preparation of the Group's consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates and assumptions are continuously evaluated and are based on management's experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, actual outcomes would differ from these estimates if different assumptions were used and different conditions existed.\nIn particular, the Group has identified the following areas where significant judgements, estimates and assumptions are required, and where actual results were to differ, may materially affect the financial position or financial results reported in future periods. Further information on these and how they impact the various accounting policies is in the relevant notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nGoing concern\nThis report has been prepared on the going concern basis, which contemplates the continuation of normal business activity and the realisation of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business.\nAt 30 September 2023, the Group held cash reserves of US$2,198,000 (2022: US$3,334,000).\nOn this basis, the Directors believe that there are sufficient funds to meet the Group's working capital requirements.\nThe Group recorded a loss of US$ 737,000 for the six months ended 30 September 2023 and had net assets of US$4,385,000 as of 30 September 2023 (2022: loss of US$1,153,000 and net assets of US$4,333,000).\nSubsidiaries Angra Ltd and GS Fintech are expected to contribute profit to the Group.\nAccruals\nManagement has used judgement and prudence when estimating certain accruals for contractor claims. The accruals recognised are based on work performed but are before settlement.\nContingencies\nBy their nature, contingencies will only be resolved when one or more uncertain future events occur or fail to occur. The assessment of the existence, and potential quantum, of contingencies inherently involves the exercise of significant judgement and the use of estimates regarding the outcome of future events. Please refer to Note 23 for further details.\nThe preparation of the Company's financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the end of each reporting period. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in the future periods.\nJudgements made in applying accounting policies\nManagement is of the opinion that there are no significant judgements made in applying accounting estimates and policies that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.\nKey sources of estimation uncertainty\nThe key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period are discussed below. The Company based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising beyond the control of the Company. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.\nProvision for expected credit losses (ECL) on trade receivables and contract assets\nECLs are unbiased probability-weighted estimates of credit losses which are determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes and taking into account past events, current conditions and assessment of future economic conditions.\nThe Company uses a provision matrix to calculate ECLs for trade receivables and contract assets. The provision rates are based on days past due for groupings of various customer segments that have similar loss patterns. The provision matrix is initially based on the Company's historical observed default rates. The Company will calibrate the matrix to adjust historical credit loss experience with forward-looking information. At every reporting date, historical default rates are updated and changes in the forward- looking estimates are analysed.\nThe assessment of the correlation between historical observed default rates, forecast economic conditions and ECLs is a significant estimate. The amount of ECLs is sensitive to changes in circumstances and of forecast economic conditions. The Company's historical credit loss experience and forecast of economic conditions may also not be representative of customer's actual default in the future.\nThe carrying amount of the Company's trade receivables at the end of the reporting period is disclosed in Note 12 to the financial statements.\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company uses the percentage-of-completion method to account for its contract revenue. The stage of completion is measured in accordance with the accounting policy stated in Note 5. Significant assumptions are required in determining the stage of completion, the extent of the contract cost incurred, the estimated total contract cost and the recoverability of the contracts. In making these assumptions, management has relied on past experience and the work of specialists.\nSignificant judgement is also required to assess allowance made for foreseeable losses, if any, where the contract cost incurred for any job exceeds its contract sum. The carrying amounts of contract balances at the reporting date are disclosed in Note 15 to the financial statements.\nAllowance for inventory obsolescence\nThe Company reviews the ageing analysis of inventories at each reporting date, and makes provision for obsolete and slow moving inventory items identified that are no longer suitable for sale. The net realisable value for such inventories are estimated based on the most reliable evidence available at the reporting date. These estimates take into consideration market demand, competition, selling price and cost directly relating to events occurring after the end of the financial year to the extent that such events confirm conditions existing at the end of the financial year. Possible changes in these estimates could result in revisions to the valuation of inventories. The carrying amounts of the Company's inventories at the reporting date are disclosed in Note 13 to the financial statements.\n4. Adoption of new and amended standards and interpretations\nThere are several new Accounting standards and interpretations issued by the IASB that are not yet mandatorily applicable to the Group and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements. The Group does not plan to adopt these standards early.\nThese standards are not expected to have a material impact on the Group in the current or future reporting periods.\n5. Summary of significant accounting policies\nProperty, plant and equipment\nPlant and equipment are shown at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into operation, any incidental cost of purchase, and associated borrowing costs. The purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset. Directly attributable costs include employee benefits, professional fees and costs of testing whether the asset is functioning properly. Capitalised borrowing costs include those that are directly attributable to the construction of mining and infrastructure assets.\nProperty, plant and equipment relate to plant, machinery, fixtures and fittings and are shown at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.\nThe depreciation rates applied to each type of asset are as follows:\nComputer Equipment\n3 years\nFixtures and fittings\n3 years\nOffice Equipment\n3 years\nSubsequent expenditure is capitalised when it is probable that future economic benefits from the use of the asset will be increased. All other subsequent expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. Assets that are replaced and have no future economic benefit are derecognised and expensed through profit or loss. Repairs and maintenance which neither materially add to the value of assets nor appreciably prolong their useful lives are charged against income. Gains/ losses on the disposal of fixed assets are credited/charged to income. The gain or loss is the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset.\nThe asset's residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed at each reporting period and adjusted prospectively if appropriate.\nInventories\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.\nFinancial instruments\na.\nFinancial assets\ni.\nClassification, initial recognition and measurement\nThe Company classifies its financial assets into the following measurement categories: amortised cost; fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI); and fair value through profit or loss (FVPL).\nFinancial assets are recognised when, and only when the entity becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.\nAt initial recognition, the Company measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at FVPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial assets. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVPL are expensed in profit or loss.\nTrade receivables are measured at the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third party, if the trade receivables do not contain a significant financing component at initial recognition.\nii.\nSubsequent measurement\nDebt instruments\nSubsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Company's business model for managing the asset and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the asset. The Company only has debt instruments at amortised cost.\nFinancial assets that are held for the collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. Financial assets are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the assets are derecognised or impaired, and through the amortisation process.\nDebt instruments of the Company comprise cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables.\nEquity instruments\nOn initial recognition of an investment in equity instrument that is not held for trading, the Company may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income which will not be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss. Dividends from such investments are to be recognised in profit or loss when the Company's right to receive payments is established. For investments in equity instruments which the Company has not elected to present subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income, changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss.\niii.\nDerecognition\nA financial asset is derecognised where the contractual right to receive cash flows from the asset has expired. On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income for debt instruments is recognised in profit or loss.\nb.\nFinancial liabilities\ni.\nInitial recognition and measurement\nFinancial liabilities are recognised when, and only when, the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument. The Company determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition.\nAll financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value plus in the case of financial liabilities not at FVPL, directly attributable transaction costs.\nii.\nSubsequent measurement\nAfter initial recognition, financial liabilities that are not carried at FVPL are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised, and through the amortisation process.\nFinancial liabilities measured at amortised cost comprise trade and other payables.\niii.\nDerecognition\nA financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. On derecognition, the difference between the carrying amounts and the consideration paid is recognised in profit or loss.\nOffsetting\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Company has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents are measured at fair value, based on the relevant exchange rates at balance sheet date. Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short-term deposit that are readily convertible to known amount of cash and that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in their fair value and are used by the Company in the management of its short-term commitments. For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.\nImpairment\nFinancial assets\nThe Company recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt instruments not held at FVPL and contract assets. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Company expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms.\nECLs are recognised in two stages. For credit exposures for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, ECLs are provided for credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the next 12-months (a 12-month ECL). For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is recognised for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure, irrespective of timing of the default (a lifetime ECL).\nFor trade receivables and contract assets, the Company applies a simplified approach in calculating ECLs. Therefore, the Company does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Company has established a provision matrix that is based on its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment which could affect debtors' ability to pay.\nThe Company considers a financial asset in default when contractual payments are past due for more than 90 days. However, in certain cases, the Company may also consider a financial asset to be in default when internal or external information indicates that the Company is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Company. A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows.\nNon-financial assets\nThe carrying amounts of the Company's non-financial assets, other than inventories, are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its related cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.\nThe recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets. If this is the case, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGU to which the asset belongs. If the recoverable amount of the asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount.\nThe difference between the carrying amount and recoverable amount is recognised as an impairment loss in profit or loss.\nAn impairment loss for an asset other than goodwill is reversed only if, there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The carrying amount of this asset is increased to its revised recoverable amount, provided that this amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of any accumulated amortisation or depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.\nA reversal of impairment loss for an asset other than goodwill is recognised in profit or loss\nTrade and other payables\nTrade and other payables are non-derivative financial liabilities that are not quoted in an active market. It represents liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the year end and which are unpaid. These amounts are unsecured and have 7-30 day payment terms. Trade and other payables are presented as current liabilities unless payment is not during within 12 months from the reporting date. They are recognised initially at their fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\nInterest-bearing loans and borrowings\nInterest-bearing loans and borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest (EIR) method. The fair value implies the rate of return on the debt component of the facility. This rate of return reflects the significant risks attaching to the facility from the lenders' perspective.\nDetermination of Fair Values\nA number of the Company's accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. Fair values have been determined for measurement and/or disclosure purposes based on the following methods. When applicable, further information about the assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specific to that asset or liability.\nTrade and other receivables\nThe fair values of trade and other receivables are estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the measurement date. Current receivables with no stated interest rate are measured at the original invoice amount if the effect of discounting is immaterial. Fair value is determined at initial recognition and, for disclosure purposes, at each annual reporting date.\nNon-derivative financial liabilities\nNon-derivative financial liabilities are measured at fair value at initial recognition and for disclosure purposes, at each annual reporting date. Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the measurement date.\nOther financial assets and liabilities\nThe carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities with a maturity of less than one year is assumed to approximate their fair values.\nProvisions\nProvisions are measured at the present value of management's best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period. The discount rate used to determine the present value is a pre-tax amount that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money, and the risks specific to the liability. The increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as interest expense.\nFinance income\nInterest income is made up of interest received on cash and cash equivalents.\nDeferred taxation\nDeferred income tax is provided using the balance sheet method on temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.\nDeferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences.\nDeferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, can be utilised, except:\nIn respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.\nThe carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at the end of each reporting period and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will be available to allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.\nDeferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.\nForeign currencies\ni) Functional and presentation currency\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the Group's presentation currency.\nii) Transaction and Balances\nTransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency at the respective functional currency rates prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the spot rate of exchange ruling at the reporting dates. All differences are taken to the profit or loss, should specific criteria be met.\nNon-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as at the date of the initial transaction. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined.\niii) Group Companies\nThe results and financial position of foreign operations (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:\n\u00b7\nAssets and liabilities for each statement of financial position presented as translated at the closing rate at the date of the statement of financial position.\n\u00b7\nIncome and expenses for each income statement and statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income are translated at average exchange rates (unless this is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transactions dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions), and\n\u00b7\nAll resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties.\nRevenue is recognised when the Company satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to the customer, which is when the customer obtains control of the good or service. A performance obligation may be satisfied at a point in time or over time. The amount of revenue recognised is the amount allocated to the satisfied performance obligation.\nRendering of services\nRevenue from rendering of services is recognised as performance obligations are satisfied. Payments are due from customers based on the agreed billing milestone stipulated in the contracts or based on the amounts certified by the customers.\nWhere performance obligations are satisfied over time as work progresses, revenue is recognised progressively based on the percentage of completion method. The stage of completion is assessed by reference to the cost incurred relative to total estimated costs (input method). The related costs are recognised in profit or loss when they are incurred, unless they relate to future performance obligations.\nIf the value of services rendered for the contract exceeds payments received from the customer, a contract asset is recognised and presented separately on the balance sheet. The contract assets are transferred to receivables when the entitlement to payment becomes unconditional. If the amounts invoiced to the customer exceeds the value of services rendered, a contract liability is recognised and separately presented in the statement of financial position.\nInterest Income\nInterest income is recognised using the effective interest method. When a receivable is impaired, the Group reduces the carrying amount to its recoverable amount, being the estimated future cash flow discounted at the original effective interest rate of the instrument, and continues unwinding the discount as interest income.\nContract assets and liabilities\nContract assets primarily relate to the Company's rights to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date on project work. Contract assets are transferred to trade receivables when the rights become unconditional. This usually occurs when the Company invoices the customer.\nContract liabilities primarily relate to advance consideration received from customers and progress billings issued in excess of the Company's rights to the consideration.\n6.

Completion of the Semnet acquisition is subject,\ninter alia\n, to the agreement of a completion assets statement, which may require adjustment of the consideration upwards or downwards, and no material adverse change having occurred in the Semnet business.\n25. Financial risk management objectives and policies\nThe Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks. The Group's Board provides certain specific guidance in managing such risks, particularly as relates to credit and liquidity risk. Any form of borrowings requires approval from the Board and the Group does not currently use any derivative financial instruments to manage its financial risks. The key financial risks and the Group's major exposures are as follows:\nCredit risk\nThe maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of the financial assets. In relation to cash and cash equivalents, the Group limits its credit risk with regards to bank deposits by only dealing with reputable banks. In relation to sales receivables, the Group's credit risk is managed by credit checks for credit customers and approval of letters of credit by the Group's advising bank.\nForeign Currency Risk\nCurrency risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates.\nThe company is exposed to currency risk on sales and purchases, that are denominated in foreign currencies.\n26. Liquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.\nThe Group monitors its risk to a shortage of funds using a combination of cash flow forecasts, budgeting and monitoring of operational performance.\n27. Capital management\nCapital includes equity attributable to the equity holders of the parent. Refer to the statement of changes in equity for quantitative information regarding equity.\nThe Group's primary objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders. For details of the capital managed by the Group as of 30 September 2023, please see Note 19.\nThe Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital.\nThis information is provided by RNS, the news service of the London Stock Exchange.
